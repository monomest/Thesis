1246,PUT THE WASHERS RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF LIKE JUST ON DIFFERENT SPA PLACES,PUT THE WASHERS RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF LIKE JUST ON DIFFERENT SPIPLACES
1247,I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU,I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
1248,THERE'S UM SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THEN A WASHER'S GOING INTO THE UM UM THE CUP,THERE'S AM SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE AWASHES GOING INTO THE UM A TEV CUT
1249,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER
1250,THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE UM THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AREN'T AS UM STRONG,THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE UM THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS ARN IS UM STRONG
1251,UM WELL WHEN Y WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GONNA PU IT'S GONNA PROBABLY BREAK MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNET,UM WELL WHEN WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GOIN TO IT'S GOIN TO PROBABLY BREAK MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS AN BETWEEN THE MAGNET
1252,WHEN THERE'S SPACE BETWEEN UM THE MAGNETS UM THE FORCE ISN'T AS STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASILY,WHEN THERE'S SPACE BETWEEN UM THE MAGNETS AM THE FORCE ISN'T AS STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASILY
1253,THERE'S A BIGGER UM LIKE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM WHEN THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,HERE'S A BIGGER UM LIKE SPACE BETWEEN EM WHEN THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
1254,N GROUP A B AND D UM THE WASHERS ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND IN GROUP C THEY'RE JUST KINDA SCATTERED AROUND THE CUP,IN GROUP A B AND D UM THE WASHERS ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND IN GROUP C THEY'RE JUST KIND O SCATTERED AROUND THE CUP
1255,WELL IN GROUP C THERE'S ONLY FI IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WASHERS WITH N ZERO SPACERS AND IN A B AND D IT ALL THEY TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS,WELL IN GROUP SE THERE'S ONLY FIVE IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WASHERS WITH ZERO SPACERS AND IN A B AN D IT AL THEY TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS
1256,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS IN THERE TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS IN THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRIED TO BREAK THE FORCE AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPACER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAK THE FORCE,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS AND THEYWERE TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS IN THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRIED TO BREAK THE FORCE AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPACER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAK THE FORCE
1257,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES
1258,BYE SEE YOU TOMORROW,BY SEE YOU TO MORROW
1259,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER UM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT IS A UM THAT THE SPACER IS IN BETWEEN,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER AM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT O  THE AM THAT THE SPACER IS IN BETWEEN
1260,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM MAGNETS AND THEY SEEING HOW HOW F UM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,E'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM MAGNETS AND THEY SEEING HOW HALF AM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS
1261,UM IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK,UM IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK
1262,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BR HOW MANY WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BHOW MANY WATCHES YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS
1263,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS ARE THE FORCE IS LEA IT'S UM WEAKENING,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS AR THE FORCES LITS UM WEAKENING
1264,UM THE MORE WASHERS THAT YOU ADD THE EASIER OR WHEN THE THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE LE IT'S NOT AS STRONG SO THEY BREAK APART,UMTHE MORE WATSHERS THE YOU ADD THE EASIER AR WHEN THE THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE LET IT'S NOT AS STRONG SO THEY BREAK APART
1265,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE UM ER AND THEN WE WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG IT HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BROKE,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN UM AND THEN WE WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFORE THE FORSE BROKE
1266,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1267,IT'S LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM AND IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LON HOW THE FORCE HOW MU HOW BY TOGETHER THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE FOR THERE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE,S LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEEN EM AND IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LON HOW THE FOR HOW HOW CLOSE TOGETHER THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE FOR THERE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE
1268,WE USE THE BALANCE AND WE PUT LIKE SPACE UH WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONE SIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS IN IT AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AH AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPACERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK BEFORE THE B FORCE BROKE,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT IT LIKE SPACEO WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONE SIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS ON TET AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS A AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPACERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WATSHERS IT TOOK BEFORE THE FORCE BROKE
1269,WELL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STICK THEY JUST LIKE PUSHED APART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALMOST NO WAY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PUT 'EM TOGETHER THEY'D GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UM SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORCE THERE,WHEN THEY DIDN'T WANT O STICK THEYRE JUST LIKE PUSHED APART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALMOST NO WAY TO PUSH EM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PUT EM TOGETHER THEY'D GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UM SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORCE THERE
1270,E REASON ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO G GET THAT IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TOO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE MA THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK,REASON ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GET THAT IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MANSNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TOO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH AL THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK
1271,MARNIE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER,MARNI IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER
1272,GOODBYE MARNIE,GOOD BYE MARNI
1273,UM THERE IS A LIKE A THERE'S LIKE UH THEY COULD LIKE STICK THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT COULD PULL 'EM TOGETHER AND THERE'S A FORCE THAT COULD PUSH 'EM APART,THERE IS A LIKE ATHERE'S LIKE ATHEY COULD LLYK STICK THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT COULD PULL EM TOGETHER AND THERE'S A FORCE THAT COULD PUSH HEM APART
1274,OH THE ELEC UM THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CLIP MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET,OH THE ALEA THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CLIT MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET
1275,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1276,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IS IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP STAYS AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM SIN THE IS IN THE AM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIPS STAYS AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM
1277,UM WE'VE BEEN UH LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS,UM WE'VE BEEN A LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND A SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1278,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THERE IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THEY IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART
1279,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UH USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT 'EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE  USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AN A YOU COULD LIKE PUT EM AH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE A MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNETS NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK
1280,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,THINK THAT THE AM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROSS THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN TSINCE THE MAGNETISM IS STILL IN THERE IT A MAKES THE MAGNET T MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL  STICK TO THE PAPER CLICK
1281,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1282,WELL W WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN 'EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN 'EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT THE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WOR THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE,WELL WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM DAY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN AM THEN IT WILL WORK THEN AM THEN IT WILL WORK THTHEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE
1283,WELL THEY'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT 'EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO LI IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO,WELL THER THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CUN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOUV PUT EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO L IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT ID TO
1284,AGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL,MI IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL
1285,THERE'S A FORCE THAT PU THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS 'EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER,ERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PTHERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF A THEY JUST LIKE A TRACK TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULDN'T MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER
1286,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET MEANS IT'LL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,UM IT'S BECAUSE A TO DAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT  I IBEBECAUSE THE THE M THE DOLL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET ITMEANS TAT IT WILL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES
1287,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOME THICK THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOME THING'S IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM MIKE SOME THINK THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOME THINGS IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE
1288,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETI THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND IT'LL STAY ON THE NAIL,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETTHE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND ITLL STAY ON THE NAIL
1289,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT N IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT IT'S ON IT AND THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET,OH WHETHE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO AM THE SINCE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS TTHE NAIL I DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT IT'S NOT A PERMANENT AM MAGNET I THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT MAGNET IT'S ON IT AND THEN THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET
1290,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
1291,UM WELL THE THICKNESS IF WE IF IT'S TOO THICK AND THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE IRON OR STEEL THEN UM IT'LL,IF IT'S NOT A STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T WORK AND IT WON'T GO THROUGH THE THICKNESS BUT IF IT'S THICK ENOUGH IF IT'S NOT TOO THICK THEN IT WILL GO AM THEN IT WILL GO RIGHT IT'LL GO THE RIGHT WAY AND IT WILL KEEP KEEPING
1292,THE LONG SILVER OBJECT IS UM IT'S CALLED A DULL NAIL AND UM AND THERE'S A UM THERE'S A LIKE A MAG THE MAGNET IS LIKE SENDING MAGNETISM THROUGH THE DULL NAIL AND IT'S GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP IT'S GOING TO THE PERRY CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING TO IT IT'S ATTRACTING THIS PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NAIL INSTEAD OF IT HAVING TO STICK EXACTLY TO THE MAGNET,A LONGSILVER OBJECT IS UM IT'S CALLED A DULL NAIL AND UM AND THERE'S A U THERE'S A LIKE A MAGTHE MAGNET IS LIKE SENDING MAGNETISM THROUGH THE DULL NAIL AND IT'S GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP IT'S GOING TO THE PERRY CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING TO IT IT'S ATTRACTING THIS PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NAIL INSTEAD OF IT HAVING TO STICK EX
1293,GOODBYE MARNIE I NEED TO TALK I CAN TA,GOD BY MINI I NEED TO TALK O CAN
1294,WELL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT'LL BE THE LIGHT BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER,WELL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT'LL BE THE LIGHT BUBBLEL BE BRIGHTER
1295,WELL THE WHOLE FLOW STOPS,WILE THE WHOLE FLOAT STOPS
1296,IF ONE BULB BURMS OUT THEN THEY BOTH THE UM THE OTHER BU THE OTHER BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THE OTHER KIND OF CIRCUIT THEN THEY THEY'D BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH THE SAME UM ENER THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IF ONE BUL BURNS OUT THEN THEY' BOTH THEM THE OTHER BUT THE OTHER BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THE OTHER KIND OF CIRCUIT THEN THEY THEY'D BOTH BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH THE SAME AM ENETHEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY
1297,WELL WELL IT ALL STOPS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE MMM BECAUSE Y ONE DIES OUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT SO IF YOU CLICK ON IT THEN THAT MEANS BOTH OF THEM WILL DIE OUT BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THE THE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE SECOND ONE IT'LL KEEP GOING SO UH BECAUSE IT'S DEAD AND IT CAN GO THROUGH THE SECOND ONE,WELL IT ALL STOPS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE BECAUSE ONE DIES OUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT SO IF YOU CLICK ON IT THEN THAT MEANS BOTH OF EM WILL DIE OUT BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THTHE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE SECOND ONE IT'LL KEEP GOING SO A BECAUSE IT'S DEAD AND IT CAN GO THROUGH THE SECOND ONE
1298,WELL YOU COULD REALLY USE BOTH OF 'EM BUT IF YOU USE UM A SERIES CIRCUIT THEN UM THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GONNA BE MORE DIM BUT IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE AS DIM,OH YOU COULD REALLY USE BOTH OF EM BUT IF YOU USE UM A SERIES CIRCUIT THEN AM THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GOING TO BE MORE DIM BUT IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE AS DIM
1299,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS,IL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERIE CIRCUITS
1300,WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE THEY DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST UM UP AND THROUGH SO YEAH,WELL THERE'S HONE THEY WANT THERE THEY DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST UM UP AND THROUGH SO YE
1301,WELL WHEN YOU BURN OUT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOSTLY THEY BOTH GO OFF,WHEN YOU BURN OUT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOSTLY THEY BOTH GO OFF
1302,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THEN IT WON'T WORK VERY GOOD,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TOTH AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THEN IT WON'T WORK VERY GOOD
1303,WELL IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR UM A CIR A LONG STRING A LIGHTS IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE AS UH UH THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS BRIGHT,LL IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR ON A CIRLONG STRING O LIGHTS IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE AS A THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS BRIGHT
1304,IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY
1305,PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY HAVE TWO,PARALLEL THE CIRCUIT THEY HAVE TWO
1306,MARNIE,ONY
1307,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I NOT REALLY NOW
1308,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1309,WELL THERE IS ON THERE'S ONLY W UM ONE PA UH THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THE THEY'RE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER,WELL THERE ITS ONTHERE'S ONLY A ONE A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO TH THEIR THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
1310,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY
1311,I DISCOVERED THAT UM IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIGHT IS THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME,I DISCOVERED THAT IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIGHT IS THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME
1312,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S A TWO PATHWAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE'S ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BULBS,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S A TWO PATHWAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE'S ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BOLBS
1313,DIFFERENCES UM IS THAT THE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE SAME AND THEY'RE LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE IT'S THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ENOUGH ENERGY,IFFERENCES UM IS THAT THE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE KE THE SAME AND THEYI'RE LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE S THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ENOUGH ENERGY
1314,BECAUSE THEN YOUR STRINGS WILL BE LIGHTER AND WHEN THERE'S MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE LIGHT,BECAUSE THEN YOUR STRINGS WILL BE LIGHTER AND WHEN THERE'S MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE LIGHT
1315,WELL THE ONE THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS,WELL THE ONE BOAT THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS
1316,WELL IT H IT'S BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS A DEAD BATTERY IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE IT'S BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COULDN'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON,O IIT'S BECAUSE M THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS A DEAD BATTERY  COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO ITS BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULP BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULP ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COULDN'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON
1317,I'M AWESOME,MYSON
1318,UM WELL THEY'RE GOING THROUGH LIKE UM THEY GO AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THEY GO OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH AND THEN IN,UM WELL THEY'RE GOING THROUGH LIKE A THEY GO AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THEY GO OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH AND THEN IN
1319,THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YOU'RE SEPARATING THE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER,THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YERE SEPARATING THE WTHE ROCKS FROM THE WATE

1546,THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME,THEY'RE IN A SHERY CIRKET CUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME
1547,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BACK TO THE,IT IS CLOSE SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH TILL THE LIGHT BOB TO THE BACK TO THE B
1548,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ON THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY BECAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ON THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY CAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
1549,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BURN OUT IT TURNS INTO AN OPEN CIRCUIT,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BARN OUT IT TURNED INTO AN OPEN SIRKET
1550,INTO THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTO,UNTIL THE CIRCIT TURNS INTO
1551,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK,BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WER
1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,I'VE BEEN SIK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANYTHING

1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,LEYONES AE OA A LITTE NOTS OF OFP
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BECAUSE THOUG TWO LIPE ALLSOR SHARING ENNER
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,KTOSOLIMI IS WORKING IN ONE OF THE BOBS BUT ONCE  YO GET A RIV FELMIT THE BOM WAS DRYIN TO TO DO BO WATER WORKING
1567,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THE FILLMENT BREAKS ON ONE TO THE ENERGY HE
1569,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP,THE LIGHT BALL WIS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN HE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP
1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT THE END
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE THE SWITH IS O
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,THAT SENSE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,I MUST THOUT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT COSE LAD HAD O TAT THAUT I TA A TOUT THAT THAT TA
1574,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW HOW
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,THE BOLL DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BOLT DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT LIT B
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BOLTS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,TREE CIRCITS TER CIRCITS CAN ARE A BIG CIRCLE PLUCK IT IN IN PARALLEL CIRCITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCITS
1578,WHAT THE ENERGY FLOWING ONE,LI WITH THE ENERGY FLOWING ON WI
1579,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T MATTER,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T MATTER
1580,I KNOW IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS ON,A NO INTANCLOSE THE SECOD BIS THE SWITCH IS UP IWIO
1581,THROUGH FILAMENTS AREN'T,TWO FILMENTS ARE
1582,A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,A SERY SIRKIN MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DO
1583,I THINK THE BULB IS NOT LIT UP BECAUSE IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OPEN,I THINK THE BALL WAS NOT LET UP BECAUSE IT'S A CLOSE CIRCIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS O PLO
1584,WHAT'S YOUR NAME,WHATS YOUR NAME
1585,ONE LIGHT BULB'S HAVING TOO,ONE LIP OLF IS HAVING TOO M
1586,THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED TO THE D CELL,THEY WERE ALL CONDECTED TO THE DEE SHELL
1587,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIGHTUB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY
1588,THAT ONE OF THEM IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILAMENT IS,THAT ONE OF THE IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE PILAMENT IS BU
1589,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S AWESOME,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS ALSO
1590,BECAUSE THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT,BECAUSE THE SERIES CIRCEY IS SHORT
1591,STOP STOPS GLOWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB,STOP IT STOPS FOWING BECAUSE A LIGHT BALL
1592,THAT,THAT
1593,WE TOOK SOME STEEL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ATTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE TOOK SOME STEEL AM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ETRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T
1594,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRIED USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP
1595,THEY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE,EY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE
1596,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
1597,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF YE TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
1598,THE NAILS AND THE PAPER CLIP,THE NAIL S AND THE PAPER CLIP
1599,SINCE THEY ATTRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS,SINCE THEY ETRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS
1600,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT
1601,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF,ALOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
1602,O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO,O THAT THE NEHOPE JUST KIND O DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
1603,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF F WOULD C WOULD MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF WOULD CAND MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF
1604,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
1605,AND THE ROCK THE S STEEL ROCK,IN THE ROCK THE STEEL ROCK
1606,YES,YES
1607,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE N NET THE NAIL DID,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE NET THE NAIL DID
1608,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM STAY LIKE THA,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM TODAY LIKE TH
1609,YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THEY'LL DEPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD ATHICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THELL THINK EPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS
1610,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T,YA SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T
1611,THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET,OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
1612,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER,YA IT COMES TOGETHER
1613,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE TH THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T G ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T ATRAC THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE PIECE PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
1614,WE HAVE PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK S STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ONTO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT,WE HAVE PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ON TO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT
1615,GOOD,GOOD
1616,YEAH SOMETIMES,YE SOMETIMES
1617,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND M ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY BY LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER ANDON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY CLOSE LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW
1618,TTRACTED EACH OTHER,FECTED EACH OTHER
1619,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNETS RUBBED ON TH THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNE IT MAKES IT M A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNET RUBBED ON THE THEDEAL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUB TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNETIT MAKES IT A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
1620,IT IT STUCK ON ONTO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK T AS WELL,IIT STUCK NON TO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK AS WELL
1621,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH I AND WHAT WOULDN'T
1622,THEY'RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER,THEY ARE ATRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
1623,THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER,THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER
1624,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS A MAGNET,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS I MACK
1625,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STAY LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STEE LIKE THAT AND YOU CUN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD
1626,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
1627,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS SO FIND AND YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS OL YOU COULD FIND IN YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN
1628,MAGNET DID,MAGNET DED
1629,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT I IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
1630,THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK,THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROU THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK
1631,THE UM THE WHAT WAS IT CALLED THE UM,THE AM TE PPRASICTHE AM
1632,THE BATTERY UM TELLS THEM THE THE M,THE BATTERY UM TELLS THEM THE THEM
1633,THEY HAVE TO TOUCH IT OR ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY TOUCHING IT BUT IT HAS TO BE PRETTY NEAR OF IT NEAR IT REALLY BY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY BUT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING IT LITTLE BIT,THEY HAVE TO TOUCH IT OR ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY TOUCHING IT BUT IT HAS TO BE PRETTY NEAR OF IT NEAR IT REALLY CLOSE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY BUT HAS TO BE TOUCHING AT LITTLE BIT
1634,THE MOTOR IS GOING FROM ALL OF IT THE UM THE BATTERY HAS THE TWO THE OF THEM THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH HAS THEM ALL CONNECTED AND SINCE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED IT MAKES THE MOTOR GO,THE MOTOR IS GOING FROM ALL OF IT THE UM THE BATTERY HAS THE TWO THOF THEM THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH HAS THEM ALL CONNECTED AND SINCE THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND MAKES THE MOTOR GO
1635,AND THE LIGHT BULB CAN FEEL IT COMING THROUGH SO IT TURNS ON AND IT GOES DOWN THROUGH THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE AND IT GOES BACK AND THEN IT GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY,AND THE LIGHT BULB CAN FEEL IT COMING THROUGH SO IT TURNS ON AND IT GOES DOWN THROUGH THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE AND IT GOES BACK AND THEN THEY GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
1636,IT LOOKED THE SAME,IT LOOKED THE SAME
1637,WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO,WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO
1638,WELL UM THE BATTERY,WELL ON THE BATTERY

1640,THE BATTERY PUSHES IT TO THE MOTOR NO MATTER W WAY IT GOING IT WILL JUST GO A DIFFERENT WAY,THE BATTERY PUSHES IT TO THE MOTOR NO MATTER WHAWAY IT'S GOING IT WILL JUST GO A DIFFERENT WAY
1641,WE TOOK A BATTERY AND A WIRE AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP WITH ANOTHER ONE THAT ANOTHER CLIP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY THAT CONNECTED TO A SWITCH AND THE SWITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE CLIP HAD A WIRE THAT CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT WHICH WOULD HELP IT,WE TOOK A BATTERY AND A WIRE AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP WITH ANOTHER ONE THA ANOTHER CLIP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY THAT CONNECTED TO A SWITCH AND THE SWITH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE CLIP HAD A WIRE THAT CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT WHICH WOULD HELP IT
1642,BY THE BATTERY,BY THE BATTERY
1643,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB IS ON,BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS ON
1644,WE TOOK ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP NEXT TO THE BATTERY THAT KEPT IT BY THE BATTERY AND THEN WITH THE OTHER ONE WE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE ONE WITHOUT THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN WE DID IT WITH THE SWITCH WE TOOK IT AND WE GOT THIS PIECE OF WIREISH THING AND WE CONNECTED ONE END OF THE MOTOR'S WIRES TO IT TO THE CLIP AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER ONE AND CONNECTED IT TO A CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND THEN WITH THE WIRE WE CLIPPED IT ON THE OTHER CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND CONNECTED THAT ONE TO THE OTHER,WE TOOK ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP NEXT TO THE BATTERY THAT KEPT IT BY THE BATTERY AND THEN WITH THE OTHER ONE WE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE ONE WITHOUT THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN WE DID IT WITH THE SWITCH WE TOOK IT AND WE GOT THIS PIECE OF WIRISH THING AND WE CONNECTED ONE END OF THE MOTORS WIRES TO IT TO THE CLIP AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER ONE AND CONNECTED IT TO A CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND THEN WITH THE WIRE WE CLIPPED IT ON THE OTHER CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND CONNECTED THAT ONE TO THE OTHER
1645,IS HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING,IS HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FUL THING
1646,LITTLE THINGS I FORGOT THE NAME OF THEM GO THROUGH THE WIRE IN THROUGH THEM LIKE DON'T GO THROUGH THEM BUT KINDA GO AGAINST AND KINDA GO THROUGH IT FEELS KINDA LIKE,LITTLE OLD THINGS I'VE GOT THE NAME OF THEM GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND THROUGH THEM LIKE  DON'T GO THROUGH THEM BUT KIND O GO AGAINST AND KIND A GO THROUGH T FEELS KIND LIKE
1647,WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY,WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
1648,TODAY WE UM TOOK A MOTOR AND A BATTERY AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO THEN WE TOOK THE MOTOR AND A BATTERY WITH THE SWITCH AND TRIED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY,TO DAY WE TOOK A MOTOR AND A BATTERY AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO THEN WE TOOK THE MOTOR AND A BATTERY WITH THE SWITCH AND TRIED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY
1649,THESE LITTLE MICROSCOPIC UM THING MICROSCOPIC UM,THESE LITTLE MICROSCOPICUM MICROSCOPICUM
1650,THE BATTERY IS GIVING THE WI GIVING SOME TO TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON THE BATTERY'S PUTTING THE S UH IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE WIRES WHICH THAT A THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH HAS IS THERE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS THERE AND THE SWITCH WHEN IT GOES OVER THERE IT HITS THAT IT MAKES THE BATTERY KNOW AND THEN IT TELLS THE MOTOR TO GO ON,THE BATTERY IS GIVING THTHE WI GIVING SOME TO TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON THE BATTERY'S PUTTING THE IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE WIRES WHICH THAT THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH HAS IS THERE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS THERE AND THE SWITCH WHEN IT GOES OVER THERE IT HITS THAT IT MAKES THE BATTERY KNOW AND THEN IT TELLS THE MOTOR TO GO ON
1651,THE UM MOTOR DOESN'T REALLY UM IT GOES THE A DIFFERENT WAY SO SINCE THE BATTERY IS FLIPPED,THE UM MOTOR DOESN'T REALLY O IT GOES THE A DIFFERENT WAY SO SINCE THE BATTERY IS FLIPPED
1652,THE BATTERY IS THERE AND THE WIRE SINCE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS IS GOING THROUGH IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB,THE BATTERY IS THERE AND THE WIRES SINCE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS IT IS GOING THROUGH IT IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB
1653,THAT IS THE SWITCH TURNING THE MOTOR ON BY IT'S GOING BY THAT THAT'S HITTING IT TO MAKE THE WIRE KNOW THAT'S THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE MOTOR,THAT IS THE SWITCH TURNING THE MOTOR ON BY IT'S GOING BY THAT THAT'S HITTING IT TO MAKE THE WIRE KNOW THAT'S THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE MOTOR

1655,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1656,IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THEY WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING,IF THE MAGNETE WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THE WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
1657,WE HAD HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE CHARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY,WE HA HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP CAUSE WE WERE CHARDING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY
1658,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH
1659,IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SWIT SWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND TO MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT THERE IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AGAIN,ITIS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE DCEL GOING THROUGH TO THE SWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTRO MAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND SO MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AGAIN
1660,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MINUS SIGN WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY A LITTLE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND TO PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRY TO PICK THEM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MINEST SIGN HOW WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTER THE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRY TO PICK EM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB EM OFF INSTEAD
1661,YES,YES
1662,THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND INSTEAD TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE,THERE'S ONLY TEN RAPS AROUND INSTEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE
1663,YES,YES
1664,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL IS IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS A MAGNET WE WOULDN'T USE WE'LL NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOMETHI A SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PICK,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE DCEL IS  IN'T VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS A MAG WE WOULDN'T USE WE'D NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOMA SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PICK
1665,IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS THEN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP,IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOULL WRAP IT AROUND LESS THAN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP
1666,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND OUR HOU IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT SO WE DON'T TO TO PUT THEM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US IF WE DONT HAV TO GRAB EM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES ROUND OR IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCHS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK EM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT SO WE DON'T TO TO PUT EM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB EM OFF INSTEAD
1667,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS GREAT,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS RIGHT
1668,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
1669,BECAUSE OF MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING MORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING IT A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE,BECAUSE O MORE OF T ITS FLOWING MORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING ITS A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE BBATTERY AND GO ROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE
1670,WELL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO AS A MAGNET SO UM WE THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS,WELE WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIME THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAGIT TURNED INTO OF EM AS A MAGNET SO THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS
1671,IT IS THE ELEC TRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK,IT IS THE ELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
1672,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STONGER,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT AND COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STRONGER
1673,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
1674,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET I'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
1675,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND IT HOW IT'S IT NEEDS TO GET AROUND THOSE WIRES,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY AND COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND HOW IT IT NEEDS TO GET AROUND THOSE WIRES
1676,I SEE THAT UHM THE WASHERS JUST GOT PICKED UP,I SEE THAT N THE WASHERS JUSTOP PICKED UP
1677,BECAUSE ENERGY MUST BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND ENERGY KIND OF I DON'T KNOW,BE CAUS ENERGY MUST BEIAT THROUGH AND ENERGY CAS I DON'T KNOW
1678,THAT IT LOOKS LIKE UHM THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY COOL AND UHM THERE'S ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT GOES OUT,THAT IT LOOKS LIKE AM THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE IT KIND O IT LOOKS REALLY COOL AND AM THEREIS ONE PART WHERE IT DOS IT AND OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT GLOWS OUT
1679,UHM UHM YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOU'RE ABLE ACTUALLY MAKE A MAGNET TO TURN IT ON AND OFF,O OM BUYOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOU ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MAKE AMATMET WE ARE ABLE TO TURN IT ON AND O
1680,THE RIVET MUST BE STEEL,ERITHET MUST BE STILL
1681,GOOD HOW ARE YOU,GOOD HOWABOUT YOU
1682,UHM THAT IT PICKED UP THE UHM WHAT UHM,ON THA I PICED UP TE AMFAC WA AM
1683,IS ABLE TO TURN ON THE MAGNET ON AND OFF SO IF YOU TURN IT OFF THERE UHM UHM THE WASHERS WOULD FALL OFF IF YOU KEEP IT ON THE WASHERS WILL NOT FALL OFF,AS ABLE TO TURN ON THE MANIT ON AND OFF SO IF HE TURNED IT OFF THER AM THE RIV AM THE WASHERS WOULD FALL OFF IF HE KEP IT ON THE WASHERS WILL NOT FALL OFF
1684,YOU DO NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU WRAP UP ALL THE WIRES UHM GOOD BECAUSE I DID TRY DOING THAT BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK,YOU DO NEED TO MAKE HER RIGHT RAP UP ALL THE WILERS A'M GOOD BS I DID TRY DOING THAT BUT IT WOULDN'T WOR
1685,CLOSER NOT AN OPEN ONE TO CELL ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH,CLOSSERT AND NOT AN OPEN ONE TO SELL ENERGY CANNOT GET THROUGH
1686,SO UHM THE ENERGY CAN GET THROUGH IT SO TIRED,SO ON THE ENERGY CAN GET THROUGH IT
1687,UHM THE RIVET ALL THAT WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVETS HI HOW ARE YOU HI HI,AN THE RUVY ALL THAT WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET I O I HI

1691,IT CAN'T PICK UP THE UHM IT CAN'T PICK UP THE WASHERS,IT CAN'T PICK UP THE UMIT CAN'T PICK UP THE WASHERS
1692,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY BECAUSE IT'S GETTING GIVING IT A LITTLE SHOCK MAYBE,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY IOF GITIN GIVING IT A LITTLE SHOCK MAYBE
1693,ENERGY MUST FLOW THROUGH,NERGI MUST FLO THROUGH
1694,IT KIND OF MEANS LIKE IT REMINDS ME OF BATTERIES AND UHM HOW MAGNETS WORKS,I TINGO MEAN SYCHA REMINDS ME OF BATTERIES AND OM HEMAN AT WORK
1695,I CAN'T REMEMBER UHM IT WAS LAST FRIDAY,I CAN'T REMEMBER A I WAS LAST FRIDAY
1696,YOU MUST HAVE IT FLOWING IN A YOU MUST HAVE A CLOSED CIRCUIT,YOU MUST HAVE IT FLOWING IN IT YOU MUST HAVE A CLOSE CIRCI
1697,THAT IT IS IN A CIRCLE,TAT IT IS IN A CIRCLE
1698,THE SWITCH USUALLY WILL STOP AND MAKE THE ENERGY GO AND UHM THERE'S UHM WASHERS UHM THERE'S UHM WASHERS AND IT LOOKS LIKE AND UHM A WIRES AND D CELL BATTERY,THE SWICH USUALLY WILL STOP AND MAKE THE ENERGY GO AND OM THERE A OM WASHERS AMTHERE'S OMWASHERS AND IT LOKS A AND OF A WIRS AND DESEL BATTERY
1699,YOU WRAP IT UP ON,W RAP IT UP ON
1700,UHM YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BATTERY ELECTROMAGNET UHM YOU NEED UH YOU DO NEED ELECTRICITY IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK UHM,M YOU MUST BEE SURE YOU HAVE A BATTERY ALECTRO MAGNET AM YOU NEED YOU DO NEED ELECTRICITY IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK UM
1701,THINK ABOUT WRAPPING THE WIRES AND UH MAKING SURE THE ENERGY'S ABLE TO FLOW,THINK ABOUT WRAPPING THE WIRS AND A MAKING SO THAT ENERGY IS ABLE TO FLOW
1702,IF UHM IF IT WAS UHM UHM IT WAS CLOSED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO IT WOULD UH IF IT'S CLOSED UHM ENERGY COULD GO THROUGH IF IT'S NOT CLOSED LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH,IF  IF IT WAS UM IF MIT WAS CLOSED WOULD BE EASIER TO IT WOULD IF ITS COS OM ENERGY TO THE FOL THROUGH IF IT'S NOT CLOSED LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW ANRICHE TAMPED IT THROUGH
1703,STEEL LIKE STEEL STEEL I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT UHM STEEL STEEL SORRY I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT BUT IT STARTS WITH STEEL I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PRONOUNCING IT RIGHT,STILL LAD SEEL STILL I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT I'M STILL STIL SORRY I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT BUT START TOA KIK I CAN I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PRONOUNCING IT RIGHT
1704,IT WOULD PROBABLY BECOME A MAGNET FOR A FEW SECONDS OR MINUTES IF SO IF THE WIRE WAS ON IT IT WOULD STAY A MAGNET FOR A LONG TIME WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THE UHM WIRE IT WILL PROBABLY STAY A MAGNET FOR JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS OR A MINUTE,WOULD POLY BECOME A MAN NET FOR A FEW SECONDS OR MINUTES IF SO IF THE WIRE IS ON IT IT WOULD STAY A MATE FIR TIME WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THE AM WIRER IT WILL PROLLY STAY A MANAT FOR JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS OR A MINUTE
1705,THE WIRES SUPPOSED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIVET SO ENERGY CAN GET TO THE RIVET AND MAKE IT INTO ELECTRIC ELECTROMAGNET,THE WIRES MUST BE CONETED TO THE RIVET SO ENERGY TO GET TO THE RIVER IND MAKE IT INTO ELECTRIC TI BEDE  ELETRICMADE
1706,IT'S A PARALLEL,IT'S A PARALEL
1707,THE OTHER GOES OUT,TE THER TOSE OUT
1708,UHM THE ENERGY KEEPS ON GOING,AM THE ENERGY KEEPS ON GOING
1709,SERIES CIRCUITS ARE LIKE STRINGS OF LIGHTS,DARYS SHARNETS ARE THY PISTERINGS ALIGHT
1710,THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL STILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY THAT KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH,THAT THE LIGHT BALL WILL STILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY THAT KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH
1711,BECAUSE UHM BECAUSE ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH IT'S OPEN,BECAUSE UM BECAUSE ENERGY CANNOT THROU IT OPEN
1712,THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP,THAT THE LIT BOX O RITER
1713,UHM IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUIT A PARALLEL,ON A SPIR SERTET OF AIRLOK TORC
1714,BECAUSE ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH CORRECTLY,CAS ENERGY CANNOT FLOW TROU CORECTL

1720,THEY SOMETIMES ARE VERY BRIGHT,THEY SOMETIMES ARE VERY BR
1721,JUST STAY OUT,OR JUST STAY OUT
1722,NOT ALL OF THEM WILL BURN OUT BUT JUST THAT ONE WILL BURN OUT,NOT ALL OF TEM WERE BURN OUT BUT JUST THAT ONE WILL BURN OUT
1723,THE FILAMENT UHM BREAKS AND THE ENERGY ON THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER LIGHT BULB KEEPS ON GLOWING BUT THE ENERGY THAT'S TRYING TO GET TO THE UHM LIGHT BULB THAT HAS THE FILAMENT BROKEN IT JUST PAUSES AND STOPS LIKE A TRAFFIC JAM,TE FULIT UMBREATS AND THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER LIFOP KEEPS ON GOING BUT THE ENERGY THYARE TRYING TO GET TO THE A LIPE AL THAT HAS THE FILMET BROKEN THIT JUST PAUSES AND STOPS LIKE TA TRAFFIC JAM
1724,UHM THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN BUT UHM WHEN WHEN THE FILAMENT BROKE ON THE OTHER PICTURE AND THE LIGHT BULBS KEPT ON GLOWING WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS IN THIS PICTURE THE LIGHT BULB DOESN'T GLOW,AM THE FILT IS BROKEN BU AM WHEN WHEN THE FILMIT BROTE ON THE OTHER PICTURE TH AND THE LIPOPS KEPT ON GOING WHEN THE FILMIT BRATS IN THIS PICTURE THE LIGHTBAL DOESN'T GO
1725,A SERIES CIRCUIT,A FARY SER
1726,ENERGY NEED TO THROUGH IT OR MAYBE THE IS EITHER OLDER OR THERE'S TOO MUCH ENERGY,ENERGY NE TO SET THROUGH AND MAYBE THE AOMT IS EITHER OLDER OR THERE WAS TOO MUCH ENERGY
1727,BECAUSE OF THE FLINT IF THE FLINT BURNS OUT THAT MEANS ENERGY CAN NOT PASS,BECAUSE OF THE FLINT IF THE FLINT BURNS OUT THAT MEANS ENERGY CANNOT PAS
1728,I SEE THAT AND THAT UHM ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH IT IS OPEN,I SEE THAT AN THAT UM ENERGY CANNOT GET THROUGH IT IS OPEN
1729,I AM GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,I AM GOD HOBOUT YOU
1730,THE IT JUST SHOWS YOU THAT'S BROKEN IT DOESN'T THE BULB UHM BURNING OUT IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU THAT UHM THE FILAMENT BURNED OUT,WITHE IT JUST SHOWS YOU THE FILMIT THAT'S BROKEN IT DOES THE BAL I'M BURNING OUT IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU THAT A FILLN A UNBURND TO
1731,WE DIDN'T DO SCIENCE BECAUSE IT'S A TUESDAY,WE GIVE HIM DETLATSOTO SIGNS BECAS IT'S A TUESDAY
1732,BECAUSE CAN'T GET THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND GO TO THE UHM OTHER LIGHT BULB,BECAUSE ENERGY CAN'T GET THROUGH THE PLIMAT AND LOTOSY ON ETHERLITBA
1733,UHM THE FILAMENT BROKE BUT THEY STILL BUT THE TWO OTHER LIGHT BULBS CAN STILL GET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY,ON THE FILM IT BROKE BUT THEY SOW BUT THEK TWO OTHER LIPOBS TENSOTITH THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONECTED TO THE BATTERY
1734,UHM THE FLINT BURNS OUT,ONTHE FLINT BURNT OUT
1735,THAT THE IT'S ONE LIGHT BULB'S ABLE TO LIGHT UP BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN WIRES AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REALLY SHARE ENERGY THE OTHER CAN'T BECAUSE THE FLINT BURNED OUT,THAT'S A IT'S AM ONE LIHKE BOB'S ABLE TO LIGHT UP BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN WIERES AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REALLY SHARE ENERGY THE OTHER CAN'T BECAUSE THE FRONT BURK
1736,THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB LIT UP BECAUSE UHM IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT,THE LIGHT BALL LID UP THE LIHT OUT LIT UP BECAUSE IT IS A CO SIRTIT
1737,THEY ARE KIND OF A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS USUALLY KIND OF STRAIGHTER,THEY ARE TINA UNAPPAROOK IS USUALLY TIM STRATER
1738,WHEN THE BULB NOTHING THE ENERGY CAN'T GET THROUGH,EN A BALB BREATS NOTHING  BHET ENERGY CAN GET THROUGH
1739,BECAUSE THAT ONE BURNS OUT UHM THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS CAN'T GET THEIR ELECTRICITY,BECAUSE THAT ONE BURNT OUT AN THE OTHER LIALTANTET THEIR ELECTRICITY

1881,YEAH HE LOOKS WEIRD BUT HE HE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL TOO,YA HE LOOKD T THAT NAR CLIS HE ASKED THE PRE TO TOO
1882,I,CI
1883,WE PUT BOTH OF THE WATERS IN AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT YOU PUT A THERMOMETER AFTER IN AFTER WE PUT MIXED THE WATERS TOGETHER AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE WHICH WAS TWENTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS,WE PUT BOTH OF THE WATERSIN AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT WE PUT ATHERLONGERAFTER IN AFTER WE PMIXE THE WATERS TOGETHER AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE MOON TEMPERATURE WHICH WAS TWENTY TWO DEGREES SOUTH EAST
1884,SOME OF THEM HAVE CELSIUS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE FAHRENHEIT HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE USES CELSIUS BESIDES US,TEY WER SOLY EFATWA AEA SOME OF THEM TA HAD STELTISIN SOME OF TEN THAT FAR AN HIGHT HEER BECAUSE EVERY ONE NASES SALSES PRESIDES NORTHERN PERE TESEN THE CHA US
1885,THEY'RE DOING THE EXPERIMENT THAT I DID YESTERDAY AND I THINK THEY'RE PUTTING IT IN ORDER AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE KIND OF DOING A SURVEY WHICH ONE WHAT THEY THINK,THER DUIM THA EXPERIMENT THAT I GO OM YESTERDAYS HAD RECISIN THEYARE PUTTING IT OOERET LOOKS AK E KIND OF JMUSTER FACE WHICH WARNS THE TACSA

2122,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2123,WIDER OR BEING VERY COMPLICATE,BRIHTER OR BEKER TO COMPLICATE A
2124,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DISCONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON I FORGOT YOUR QUESTIONS ANYWAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DISCONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON BUT I FORGOT YOUR QUESTION ANYWAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT
2125,OKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN A,O KA I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN A
2126,BECAUSE THEY DO,BECAUSE THEY DO
2127,OH NO AS WE,DON'T KNOW ASKED N
2128,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
2129,KNEW,NO
2130,YEAH THIS IS THE CAT CLOCK,IT IS THE CAT CLOCK
2131,THAT I DO NOT KNOW <unk>,THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER
2132,NO,TOSIT E NO HE SAID
2133,CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,TURKETS AND E WILL CIRKETS
2134,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUI
2135,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN VERY RADICAL WAY,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RADICAL WAY
2136,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE DEE SHELL AND THAT IT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
2137,IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE THE THUNDER YEAH YEAH EXACTLY THUNDER HA LIKE THAT LIKE YEAH,IT'S BECAUSE IT IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED IN STUFF LIE CONDOR YA YA EXACTLY CONDOR HA ELI WAGE LIYE
2138,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF,ID THINK THAT EM BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
2139,I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT,I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IT IS A SWIL CUT BAH A VERY GOOD CIRKET
2140,THEY ARE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND BUT IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED FOR ME AND <unk>,AIR COMPARED UM BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AN BITS IN A MORE COMPLICATED FORMAN BY ALADO COPSPOT
2141,NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD,NOTICE THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RAD ICL
2142,IT IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND THE STUFF,J IS GOING ROUND AND IT IS A AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH O ONE DECEL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND STUFF
2143,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
2144,WHAT,UIT
2145,DON'T,DON'T
2146,THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2147,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE AMOUNT IT'S GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS,DISFORMATION 'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE A THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE BU THE MOUNT IS GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT ITS ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AN PEOPLE UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS
2148,GOOD,O GOOD
2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,WELL THE SOIL DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN ILET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO
2151,WE BEEN,WERE  DOING
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,WE I OBSERVE THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL
2153,I SEE WATER IN SOIL,ICEE WATER AND SOIL
2154,YEAH,YE
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,YA CAUS IM CAUSE THE SAULT THE SOIL KEEPS EOTHER WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIT GROW IT CANLIK GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT ID TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP THOUGH THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLS
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,WELL HE SOYIL I'M OBSORBED MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLLETERS IN AD BUT IT WON'T LET O ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVWEL LET FORTY WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S CLOSE TO FIFTY BUT I BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AN NOT A LOT
2158,GOT WET,IT
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SCAUS THE PODTING SUO TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THEF GRAVEL DOES IT IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUT
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WE GOT GRAPPLE AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP ANTHEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG AFIVE MINUTES TAKES TO JOP WATERS
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,YE JUST LIKE THAT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I OBSERVE THAT UM UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTDING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DAR AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANT TO SAVE IT AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,THE WAY IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER CAN STILL GO IN BECAUSE THE WATER JUS FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER IN THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,IT DOESN'T GO TBROUGH AN THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT O WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER AN SOIL
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND HAS MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIK DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER
2168,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THEN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AN THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO I SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO I CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T ILL JUST LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,BECAUSE  SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROWS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANT HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AN THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT
2171,BYE,BY
2172,YEP YEP,YET YET
2173,WELL THE GRA THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOIL'S WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT U ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS IT ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUGH,WELL THE GROUT TO IMAN THE SOIL THE SOILS WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPIN IT ALL THE WAT BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH JIPS ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL I GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLLS THAT CAFITER
2174,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GE AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'D BE GREAT,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOU COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AN GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GAND THEN GO GET WATER AN USE BIG CUPS THA CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CUL SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOS MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'LL BE GREAT
2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER DRAINS WITH UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE ITS ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF O WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOES IT THE SOIL KEEPS IT
2176,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESN'T IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T UM WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON 'EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL I GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESSTIKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN IN THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN' AN YOU POUR WATER ON EM THU IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLS
2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERES MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT IN THE I MEAN THE SOIL DIN'T LET THE WATER ON THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVELS MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL
2178,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND RETUN SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN
2179,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER,YA JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER
2180,UHM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK,AM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK
2181,UHM WELL UHM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE,UM WELL UM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE
2182,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLOURS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE
2183,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BALL,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BA
2184,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ON TO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE
2185,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT
2186,GOOD,GOOD
2187,SO WHEN THE WHITE UHM LIGHT SHINING ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,SO WHEN THE WHITE AM LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2188,WELL UHM THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL BECAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK IT JUST LOOKS BLACK,WELL UM THE LIGHT YAT IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES TO THEUG RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL CAS THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE WE'RE BLACK JUST LOOKS BLACK
2189,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOUR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AN THE BLUE BALL 'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE
2190,BECAUSE THE GREEN LIGHT IS GREEN,AS THE GREEN LINE IS GRE
2191,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY UHM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL THEY ARE YELLOW,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY M ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL IT THEYARE YELLOW
2192,RED,RED
2193,UHM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,AM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OU
2194,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL
2195,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT AROUND,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT LOOK ROUT
2196,WELL SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB,WEL SHOWN FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BOL
2197,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UHM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UHM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT I'M RED AND WHEN THE CARN COMES THE BRU AM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK
2198,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT
2199,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THAT COLOR TOO,YE HAD THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER WOUD THE OTHER OBJECTS WOULD TURN THAT COLOUR TO
2200,SO WHEN WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL UHM THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAME WITH THE BLUE SO ONLY YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BALL AND ONLY BLUE COMES THROUGH FOR THE BLUE BALL BLUE BALL,SO WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL AM THE OTHER COLOR OF THE RINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAVE WIT THE BOT SO THE YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BELL AND WIL Y BE COMES TO ON THE BLUE BALL LE BOB
2201,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UHM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT AS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT AM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE AM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT WITH THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
2202,COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH,THE COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH
2203,IT'S TURNING BLACK,IT'S TURNING BLACK
2204,SO UHM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT,SO UM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALLS BLOCK AND ALL THE OTHER COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGT

2214,I DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE WINDS YOU ADD AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE STEEL WASHERS THE ELECTROMAGNET ATTRACTS,I DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE WINES YOU ADD AROUND THE STEEL RIVET THE MORE WHAT STEEL WASPERS THE ELECTRO MAGNET ATTRACTS
2215,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2216,MANY WASHERS THERE HOW MANY WASHERS THERE ARE,O MANY WASHERS THERE ARE HOW MANY WASHERS THERE ARE
2217,I DON'T KNOW THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER WHEN YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WINDS AND IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS,I DON'T KNOW THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER WHEN YOU INCREASE A NUMBER OF WINES AND I PICKS UP MORE STEEL WATER
2218,THE STRENGTH OF THE THE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET IT'S STRONGER AND THEN IT THE MORE WINDS AROUND IT MAKES IT STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS,THE STRENGTH OF THE STOF THE ELECTRO MAGNET GETS STRONGER AND THEN IT THE MORE WINDS AROUND IT MAKES IT STRONGER AND THEN IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS
2219,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN EREBEAT TH
2220,I NOTICED THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET TURNS ON AND ATTRACTS THE WASHERS,I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET TURNS ON AND ATTRACTS THE WASPER
