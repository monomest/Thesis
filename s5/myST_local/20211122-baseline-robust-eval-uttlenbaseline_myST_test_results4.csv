0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY TWO
1,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YE YE
2,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,OPROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
3,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASK WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE  LENGTH OF THE STRING
4,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,APROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE SAW IF THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
5,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SOTO THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEA CHAR AND WE SO A IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NTHE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE TIME IT WAS AM LENGTH IN THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE A TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AD THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
6,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THIT HUGED DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY  JUST FORGOT OR LIK DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS THET GOT SO
7,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESK WHERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN AM THEN WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE AM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS T WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
8,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE ITHINK THE THE LEAST WINGS WAS FIVE
9,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YA AT FIRST WE TWE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS AM LENGTH AM A STARTING POINT AND THEN UM A LIKE THE FORCE SAY THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FOURTH FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
10,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO M AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AN STUFF AND THEN AM THE I I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST WINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN I'M TO MAKE THE STHE PENDULUM SWING LESS WINGS THAN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOUL HAVE TO MAKE THE PETHE PENDULUM STRING LONGER
11,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YES WE'S DON PENDULUMS SO LIKE AMWE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE LIKE WE WERE TESTING UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
12,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BEBEUM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOMELIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
13,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YA THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED WAS PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
14,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YA
15,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE WWE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WEHOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AN THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN
16,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN ITWE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE WE TESTED WITH A DIFFERENT THING IN STUFF
17,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WEVE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES OM WERE HOW FAR OR M HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE ANLIK YE IT'S THE LITTLE FLIPSTICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN A'M ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIPSTICK
18,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,I'M TO GRAPIT SO YOU KNOW WEL WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
19,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'V BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT AM EXPERIMENTS IN STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS AN A OM WHAT ELSE WE DID AM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS
20,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THEN WHEN WE WIN THE CWEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO SO THAT'S MAY BE WHY MISS MOJAR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE
21,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
22,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAT BUTN BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
23,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY DNEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN STUFF
24,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,UUM YE AND THEN AFTWELL THEN WE TESTED IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHEN PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
25,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET THE FOUR CAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT A FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT WE DID T FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WE ADDED ALL THOSE TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YE
26,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WE ALL CAME UP WITH THER VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS STAND AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
27,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE XAXESS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE WY AXCESS WELL THE WY AXES IS RIGHT HERE THE EXCESS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED AN LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AN SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE WY AXES THERE WAS AM WA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR I WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT
28,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,ARGRAP IDON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE'S AN EX AXIS IN A WY AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE WY AXIS WAS WIT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND NOW
29,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE WY AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT
30,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ILLUMINED BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T M THEYTHEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL
31,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,HU AND THEN WEL SO SIN SIX WAS ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT NTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WWHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND SHE CHOSE TO PEOPLE TO TRY AME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO AN I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE
32,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UMIT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH SUM IIT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS OTH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELTHE POWER FTHROUGH I GUES
33,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GIT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLAINE SO I BET THE  THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GOIN TO GET THE MORS THE MOR SPIN WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TO DAT WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
34,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YA AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRADED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK A TOWE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
35,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YA AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED LIKE TO JUST PLIT AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIENC MENT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE END O THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT A SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P  SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO
36,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL NO HE REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN NE THAT WOULD BE COOL
37,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YE ACLIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WALL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY SO THEN WE JUST CIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND PRETTY MUCH WA EXACTLY
38,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YA WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ONOH YA WE'RE SKEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING FORTY SPINS DOES N'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
39,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE BLAINS CAUS IT'S LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM PLY L I WANT THE SWINGERS CAUSE THWE HAVE THIS VARIABLE'S BOOK AND ITS SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AN THE FORCE ON FORCE WAS A A WOMAN DOING ALIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HAND SPRING OFF THE WAS SHE WAS DOING A VALT AND I DO WALT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH
40,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN AS LIKE SO YOU GO ROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YE ONE TWO LIKE YA AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY TTESTED IT LIKE ONCE
41,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PARTED FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS AM BU SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED
42,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,O THE AL THER UM FLINGERS THEFIPPERS AND THEN WE EV WRE THE A LHE PENGULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS A SO
43,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO HO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING IT AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWAY SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE N ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KI I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE,YE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALF WAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO WE TRIED TO DO A WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTINATED AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE OM SWANT SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST CUN'T TII THINK WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE
44,YEAH WE GET TO USE IT AND S CAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FANS SO AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND IT GOES IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT'S WE'RE DOING S LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHER'S UM ARM SPANS LIKE WING SPAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN SO,YA WE GET TO USE IT ANDCAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FAN SO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND TIT GOES  JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT WE'RE DOING LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHERS UM ARMS SPANS LIKE WINGSPAN SO IT'S WAYG BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN S
45,YEAH YEAH AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE DOING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THE OUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING UM SLOPE,YE YE AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE TEWING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THOUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTNESS UP THE STRING UM SLOPE
46,COUNTING OR MAYBE THE PROPELLER WAS JUST IT GOT MAYBE THE RUBBER BAND WAS A LITTLE TIGHT SO IT HAD TO GET LOOSEN UP BEFORE YOU COULD DO IT I DON'T KNOW,COUNTINGS OR MAYBE THE PROPELLER WAS JUST IT GOT MAYBE THE RUBBER BAND WAS A LITTLE TIGHT SO IT HAD TO GET LOOSENED UP BEFORE YOU COULD DO IT I DON'T KNOW
47,WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT LA WELL YEAH THAT WAS THE STRING UM WE SORT OF WENT THE THESE GLIDERS YOU CAN WELL THE PROPELLERS YOU CAN TWIST UP AND UM YOU JUST KEEP TWISTING IT UP UNTIL THE RUBBER BAND LIKE SORT OF TIES AROUND ITSELF AND THEN YOU LET GO ON A STRING AND IT GOES LIKE FLYING IT'S REALLY AWESOME,WELL WE DIE HAD THAT LOT WELL YE THAT WAS THE STRING UM WE SORT OF WEN THE THESE GLIDERS YOU CAN WELL THE PROPELLERS YOU CAN TWIST UP ANT UM YOU JUST KEEP TRISING IT UP UNTIL THE RUBBER RAN LIKE SORT OF TIES AROUND ITSELF AND THEN YOU LET GO ON THI STRING AND IT GOES LIKE FLYING IT'S REALLY AWSOME
48,THIS IS THE RUBBER BAND AND IT'S PUT ON SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TWIST IT WITH THIS THE PROPELLERS ATTACHED TO IT THERE'S THIS LITTLE HOOK AND THEN UM WELL THEN WE WROTE OUR NA OUR PLANE NAME ON IT UM THE FRONTIER GLIDER AND THEN WE SORT OF GOT A SH WE WERE IN THIS AREA AND WE PUT A CHAIR ON ONE EN WE END OF THE LOCKERS AND THEN ON THE OTHER END AND THEN WE TIED A SH WE HAD A STRING TAPED TO IT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GO ZOOM AFTER YOU LIKE TWISTED IT A LOT UM HOW MUCH YOU TWISTED IT IT W THE PROPELLERS WOULD GET GOING AND IT WOULD SPIN AROUND LIKE T ON WE WIND,THIS IS THE RUBBER BAND AND IT'S PUT ON SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TWIST IT WITH THIS THE PROPELLERS ATTACHED TO IT THERE'S THIS LITTLE HOOK AND THEN AM WELL THEN WE WROTE OUR NAME OUR PLAIN NAME ON IT UM THE FRONTEER GLIDER AND THEN WE SORT OF GOT WE WERE IN THIS AREA WE PUT A CHAIR ON ONE END OF THE LACKERS AND THEN ON THE OTHER END AND THEN WE TIED AWE HAD A STRING TAPED TO IT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GO ZOOM AFTER YOU LIKE TWISTED IT ALOT A HOW MUCH YOU TWISTED IT ITHE PROPELLERS WOULD GET GOING AND THEY WOULD SPIN AROUND LIKE T UNWI WIND
49,YEAH YEAH WE ALL TRIED AND WE EACH WE DECIDED MA ME MY PARTNER KELLY AND MY PARTNER DREW UM WE ALL WE TRIED UM TO WE WERE GOING TO DO FORCE SO WE DECIDED TO USE A FAN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A FAN BECAUSE ONE FAN BATTERIES WAS DYING OUT AND ONE FAN YOU HAD TO PLUG IN AND IT ONLY HAD ONE SETTING AND LIKE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PARTICIPATING BECAUSE WE HAD TO SHARE A LINE WITH THIS THESE OTHER GR THIS OTHER GROUP SO,YET WE ALL TRIED AND WE EACH WE DECIDED MME MY PARTNER KELLY AND MY PARTNER DREW AM WE ALL WE TRIED AMTO WE WERE GOING TO DO FORCE SO WE DECIDED TO USE A FAN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A FAN BECAUSE ONE FAN BATTERIES WAS DYING OUT WAND ONE FANNE HAD TO PLUG IN AND THEY ONLY HAD ONE SETTING AND LIKE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PATICIPATING BECAUSE WE HAD TO SHARE A LINE WITH THISTHESE OTHER THIS OTHER GROUP SO
50,UH THAT IT WOULD TAKE LONGER THE CHAIRS WERE UM CROOKED THEN IF THEY WERE STRAIGHT LIKE SO LIKE IF ONE CHAIR WAS RIGHT HERE AND ONE CHAIR WAS RIGHT HERE IT WOULD BE SORTA CROOKED BUT THEN IF ONE CH THESE CHAIRS WERE LIKE THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LESS AND THEN WE ALSO THOUGHT OF FORCE IF YOU FORCE IT OR YOU WE AND THEN THEN THE NEXT DAY WE BROUGHT IN A FAN AND IT WAS SO FUN YEAH LIKE IF WE LIKE GO LIKE F THAT OR LIKE THAT WE JUST LET GO AND SO YEAH THE FAN WELL WE COULD PICK ONE VARIABLE LIKE W TWO PEOPLE PICKED SLOPE WA UM A FEW PEOPLE PUT PASSENGERS THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS,ID BET IT WOULD TAKE LONGER IF THE CHAIRS WERE U CROOKED THAN IF THEY WERE STRAIGHT LIKE SO LIKE IF ONE CHAIR WAS RIGHT HERE AND ONE CHAIR WAS RIGHT HERE IT WOULD BE SORT OF CROOKED BUT THEN IF ONE THESE CHAIRS WERE LIKE THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LESS AND THEN WE ALSO THOUGHT OF FORCE IF YOU FORCED IT OR YOU WE THEN THEN THE NEXT DAY WE BROUGHT IN A FAN AND IT WAS SO FUN YE LIKE IF WE LIT GO LIKE THAT OR LIKE THAT WE JUST LECA AND SO YE THE FAN WELL WE COULD PICK ONE VARIABLE LIKE TWO PEOPLE PICK SLOPE WHAT M A FEW PEOPLE PUT PASSENGERS THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS
51,YEAH OKAY AND THEN WE CALLED THAT THE S S E B CAUSE THEN THE FOURTH ONE WE CALLED IT THE S S N D CAUSE YEAH,YA O KAY AND THEN WE CALLED THAT THE S S  B KISIN THE FOURTH ON WE CALLED IT THE S S N D CAS YA
52,I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SAID THAT ON OUR DIRECTIONS BUT LIKE I GUESS WELL THEN THERE'S A HUGE RANGE AND STUFF,I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SET THAT ON OUR DIRECTIONS BUT LIKE I GUESS WELL THEN THERE'S A HUGE RANGE IN STUFF
53,UH PROBABLY CAUSE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MEASURE RIGHT OR AND MAYBE UH I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THE BIGGER BOATS PROBABLY HAD LESS BUT NOW I'M THINKING THAT THE BIGGER BOATS HELD MORE BECAUSE,AH PROBABLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MEASURE RIGHT OR AND MAYBE A I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THE BIGGER BOATS PROBABLY HELD LESS BUT NOW I'M THINKING THAT THE BIGGER VOTS HELD MORE BECAUSE WE
54,BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S TEN LESS I'M NOT SURE YEAH BECAUSE IT'S ONE LESS THAN THREE CENTIMETERS SO AND THEN WE DI I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY LIKE TEN AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE WALKED TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP TO TEN AND WE DREW A DOT AND THEN WE TRIED TO CONNECT A LINE A STRAIGHT LINE BUT OUR LINE SORT OF ENDED UP CURVED LIKE THAT SORT OF,BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S TEN LESS I'M NOT SURE MALLERYE BECAUSE IT'S BUT ONE LESS THAN THREE CENTIMETERS SO AND THEN WE I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY LIKE TEN AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE WALKED TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP TO TEN WE DREW A DOT AND THEN WE TRIED TO CONNECT A LINEE A STRAIGHT LINE BUT OUR LINE SORT AVE ENDED UP CURVE LIKE THAT SORT OF
55,YEAH UM I WAS THINKING HOW FULL THE WATER WAS BUT THAT'S SORT OF IT DOESN'T R LIKE IT WAS SORT OF A YEAH BUT IT WE REALLY COULDN'T MEASURE THAT S SO WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEN ALSO IT SAID THE PENNIES UH THEY NEED TO BE DROPPED A CERTAIN WAY SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A BOAT RIGHT HERE YOU HAD TO DROP YOUR PENNIES IN UH LIKE A TRIANGLE YOU SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR BOAT AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND LIKE YOU SORT OF JUST FILL UP LIKE SHE HAD IT ON THE OVERHEAD AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IT YOU WANNA LIKE THE PENNIES WERE BLACK ON THE OVERHEAD AND SHE DREW A CUP ON IT AND SHE PUT THE PENNIES DOWN AND SHE WANTED THE WHOLE CUP TO BE FILLED WITH BLACK THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO AIM FOR MY TEACHER,YE UM I WAS THINKING HOW FULL THE WATER WAS BUT THAT SORT OF IT DOESN'T LIKE IT WAS SORT OF YA BUT I WE COULDN'T REALLY MEASURE THAT SO WE DID THA WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEN ALSO IT SAID THE PENNIES A THEY NEED TO BE DROPPED A CERTAIN WAY SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A BOAT RIGHT HERE YOU HAD TO DROP YOUR PENNIES IN OH LIKE A TRYANGLE  SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR BOA AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND THEN DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND LIKE YOU SORT OF JUST FILL UP LIKE SHE HAD IT ON THE OVERHEAD AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IYOU WANTED LIKE THE PENNIES WERE BLACK ON THE OVERHEAD AND SHE DREW A CUP ON IT AND SHE PUT THE PENNIES ON AND SHE WANTED THE WHOLE CUP TO BE FILLED WITH BLACK THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO AIM F MY TEACHER
56,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERYONE GOT A DIFFERENT UM MILLILITER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PA NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT W NUMBERS OF MILLILITERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERYONE GOT A DIFFERENT AMILLOLEATER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PNUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF MILILETERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW
57,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF THE GRAPH OH YEAH THANK YOU AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOAT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOAT FOUR BUT I'M AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF THE GRAP OH YE THINK YOU AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOT FOUR BUT UNNUCHES AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME
58,WELL I RE I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OUR BUT UH WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETER I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AMO MILLILITERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY,WELL I I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OURS BUT A WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETERS I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE A MILLILETERS AND THEN A I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO DAY
59,YEAH CAUSE THIS IS THE Y AXIS I THINK X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE Y AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGERS,M ECAUSE THIS IS THE WY EXESS I THING X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE WHY AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGER
60,UM THAT WAS WE WOULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY IN S YOU COULD JUST FLIP OVER,M THAT WAS WE WU WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THED PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE Y ATO SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WERE ITS TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSIT OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOUDON' WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY AN COULD JUST FLIP OVER
61,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS AND STUFF YEAH UH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND UH THEN,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS IN STUFF WAW IT WOUD A OUAH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND AH THEN
62,UH LESS BECAUSE THIS E IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND IT ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND,ORL AH LES BECAUSE THIS IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE  MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILILETERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND I ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLALETERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND S
63,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N E CAUSE MY K PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FI SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE IT'S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN UP HERE YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE,AND THEN SO ANWE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N  CAUSE MY PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED TH THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETOR ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FISEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE SRAIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN  GOCLEA YES AND THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE
64,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID A WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VOTES AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVEWE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
65,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,OCAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TO DAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND AM THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIK TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN
66,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAPH A LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO,AH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAFFALAT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO
67,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOUGH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL AND LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE,AH YA WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAFF IT WAS CALLED THOUGH TUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL LIKE ON THE GRAF WE GRAFT WITH LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE ED SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILILETERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY A PASSENGERS I GOT SO YESHARED
68,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN AND WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S E N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN WE'D PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S  N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTEMETER BOL WE GOT A HUNDRED AN FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN IT WAS OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVENMUS O TA YA LIKE YE LOIT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PRABLAS IA
69,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PR YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS,WELL YA BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE YEA ITSAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTION
70,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AM ACWELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTALUSERS AND THEN AM WE DID THAT BECAUSE AM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUARTED WATER FROM A SERINGE INTO IT AND THEN SSUCKED IT UP WITH THE SORINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADULATED SECYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
71,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH OH OCAY THAT O CA I THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING EL SO AH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO AFFECT THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS ANDYU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
72,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DI THIS WAS OUR TWO CENTEMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PRAV WE DIDN'T RELY TIV TO THREESIN  YA IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS
73,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,A WE DID DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO CALLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR A YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THA WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO
74,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,YA YA WE DID WE I SORT OF FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT HERS WE TALKED ABOUT A WADNOTHING AND SUC
75,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER VOATES FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RAIN OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
76,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,A BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE SAY THE ORHO CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GT FIFINDIN AA CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIN FER TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
77,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME SO
78,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YA IBECAUSE DYOU WANT TO FIND WE WANT TO HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL O IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANT TO KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IANEND LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL O OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OR OUR A OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A UM ALL IN ALL UM MOT A A THREE CENTEMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE SENTWELVE PENNIES
79,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME AN SHE'S OVER THERE YE AM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LLESS NO LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TO DAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS LOAD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES AND I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM
80,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE AND WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEN THEN YOU SHAKE IT AND SAW THE WATER RISE,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE A WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILIMETERS OF WATER WHY THEN WE SHAKED IT AND SAW THE WATER RISE
81,THERE'S FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION AND THERE IS FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF THE SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE,THERE'S FIFTY MILLIO LETERS OF SALT SOLUTION AND THERE IS FIFTY MILLION LETERS OF WATER IN THE FIFTY MILILETERS OF THE SALT SOLUTION WASMORE

87,THE ONE WITH THE MORE COOL AID POWDER WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE COOL AID THE ONE WITH LESS COOL AID POWDER WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE,THE ONE WITH THE MORE COOLID POWDER WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE COOLID THE ONE WITH LESS COOLED POWERD WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE WA
88,THERE'S THE GRAPE TEST STICK THERE'S ONE SPOON OF GRAPE TEST STICK IN IN ONE CUP AND TWO SPOONS IN THE OTHER,THERE'S THE GRAPE TASTITHERE'S ONE SPOON A GRAPE TASTIGAN AND ONE CUP AND TWO POONS IN THE OTHER
89,THERE IS MORE POWDER ON THE CUP WITH THE FIVE CRYSTALS AND THERE IS LESS POWDER ON THE CUP WITH THE TWO CRYSTAL,THERE'S MORE POWDERR ON THE CUP WITH THE FIVE CRYSTALS  USE LESS POWDER ON THE CUP WITH THE TWO CRYSTAL
90,THE DARKER ONES HAVE MORE POWDER AND LESS WATER AND LESS AND THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THAT ARE MUCH LIGHTER ARE HAVE LESS POWDER BUT MORE WATER,THE DUGRE ONES HAVE MORE POWDER AND LESS WATER IN US AND THE ONS THAT DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THAT ARE MUCH LIGHTER OR HAVE LESS POWDER BUT MORE WATER
91,UM BOTH CUP THERE'S FIFTY MORE THE USE OF WATER BUT ON THE DARKER CUP THERE'S FIVE SPOONFULS OF DRINK MIX AND THE LIGHTER ONE HAS ONE SPOON ONE SPOONFUL OF DRINK,ON BOTH CUPS THERS FIFTY ME LEATLES OF WATER BUT ON THE DARKER CUP THERE'S FIVE SPOONFULS OF DRINKMIXANDTHE LIGHTER ONE HA ONE SPOON ONE SPOONFUL OF DRIN
92,THE FIRST CUP HAS LOTS OF POWDER THE SECOND CUP IS GET LESS POWDER THEN THE THIRD CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LESS HAS LESS POWDER AND THEN THE FOURTH CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LESS AND MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER AND THE THE THE LAST ONE HAS LESS POWDER AND MORE,BU FIRST CUP HAS LOTS OF POWDER THE SECOND CUP ISSTAN TO GET LESS POWDER THAN THE THIRD CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LESS HAS LESS POWDER THEN THE FOURTH CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LOSE AND MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER AND THE THE FIRTHE LAST OONE HAS LESS POWDER AND MORE
93,THE ONE THAT'S LIGHTER HAS SIX DRINK MIX AND THIRTY MILLIGRAMS OF WATER THE ONE THAT'S DARKER BUT THE ONE THAT'S LIGHTER HAS THREE THREE SPOONFULS OF DRINKING MIX THIRTY MILLIGRAMS OR THIRTY GRAMS MILLIGRAMS OF WATER,THE ONE THAT'S MITER HAS SIX I DRINKMSAN THIRTY MILGRAMS OF WATER THE ONE THAT'S DARKER BUT THE ONE THAT'S LIGHTER HAS THREE THREE SPOONFULS O DRINKING MIX THIRTY MILGRAM HETHIRTY TAM MILGRAMS OF WATER
94,THERE'S GRAINS AND THERE'S PAPER CLIPS AT THE IN IN A CUP THEN YOU PUT A MAGNET ON TOP AND IT COLLECTS ALL THE PAPER,THERES GRAINS AND THERE'S PAPER CRIPSETTA IN IN A CUP AND THEN YOU PUT A MAGATER ON TOP IN A COLLEX OF THE PAPE
95,YOU MIX NO YOU DIP THE WATER WITH THE ROCKS SO THE ROCKS STAYED ON THE STAYED ON THE STAYED ON THE STAY ON THE,EN YOU MIX NO YOU DIPPED THE WATER WITH THE ROCKS SO THE ROCKS STAYED ON THE STAYD ON THE INIT IIT AMIT TAYD ONN THEESTAYD ON THE I
96,CAUSE IF SHE POURED IN THE WATER ALL OF IT WOULD ALL OF IT WOULD STAY OUT AND WITH THE MAGNET IT WOULD JUST COLLECT THE PAPER CLIPS,CASE IF SHE POURED IT IN WATER ALL OF IT WI ALL OF IT WOULD STAY OUT AND WITH THE MAGNET I WOULD JUST COLLECT THE PAPER CLIPS
97,THE FIRST ONE IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER AND THE AND TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTION THEN THE NEXT ONE IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER AND,THE FIRST WAT IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLETERS OF WATER AND THE AND TEN GRAMS OF O SHUD THEN THER SEVETHE DECKS WE NO SEVENTY FIVE MILLIAN LETERS OF WATER AND EIGONS
98,WE PUT IN A JAR OF FREEZING AND OF WATER AND THEN PUT IT IN THE FREEZER AND SINCE THE LID WAS SO TIGHT THERE WASN'T ROOM FOR THE ICE TO GO OUT OF THE TOP SO IT BREAKS THE GLASS AND THEN YOU PUT THE WARM WATER BECAUSE IT WAS HOT,WE PUT AA JAR OF FREED N OF WATER AND THEN PUT IT IN THE FREEZER AND SINCE THE LID WAS SO TIGHT THERE WAS INROOM FOR THE ICE TO GO OUT OTHE TOP SO IT BREAKS THE GLASS NTHEN  BU TA WARM WATER  BECAUSE IT WAS HO
99,THE ROCK BREAKS APART AND AND FALLS OFF THE HILL AND FALLS INTO THE WATER AND THE WATER SHEDS IT INTO,THE ROCK BREAKS UPART AND AND FALLS OFF THE HILL AND FALLS INTO THE WATER AND THE WA PUSHES IT INTO
100,THAT THE ROCK GOT FILLED UP WITH WATER AND THEN IT FROZE AND THEN IT EXTENDED AND BROKE DOWN IT AND JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL AND MAY JUNE JULY AND NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER PASSED AND THEY,THE E ROCK GOT FILLED UP WITH WATER AND THEN IT FROZED AND IT EXTENDED AND BROKE DOWN IN JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL IN A JUNE JULY AND NOVEMBER DECEMDER PAST AND THEY CHANED ED ABLBY
101,WHEN IT'S ACID RAIN THE RAIN FALLS IN JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY NOVEMBER TWO YEARS PAST AND IT GETS ALL MOLDY AND THEN YEAH,WHEN IT'S A SAD RAIN THE RAIN FALLS IN JANUARY FEBRUAREY I MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MA JUNE JULY SUMMER IN NOVEMBER IS TWO YEARS PASS AND IT GETS OL MOT AND THEN YA VEA
102,BREAK INTO TWO PIECES DURING THE FREEZING THERE'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF CRACKS AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WITH ROCKS INTO ICE SO YEAH,ONA OLWIGTE THRO THE FREESOFTE THEREIS ONLY A MITSPA OF CRACKS AND THEN HAPPENS IS THAT IT OLOROGOTEHE CANTLAGA
103,THEY PUT A BOULDER BY THIS LITTLE CONTAINER THING AND THEN THEY POURED DOWN A A LITER OF WATER AND THEN IT FELL DOWN LIKE THE AND THEN IT FELL DOWN ON THE GROUND SO IT BUILDS DEPOSITION AND THEN IT CAME DOWN AND SHOWED HOW THE DEPOSITION WORKS,THEY PUT A RULER BY THIS LITTLE CONTAINER THINK AND THEN THEY POURED DOWN A LEATER OF WATER AND THEN IT FELL DOWN LIKE THE AND THEN IT FELL DOWN ON THE GROUND SO TE BILT E DEPOSITION AND THEN IT CAME DOWN AND SHOWED HOW THE DEPOSITION WORKS
104,THE EROSION IS LIKE AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHEN WHERE WATER FALLS DOWN LIKE AT A CREEK DEPOSITION IS LIKE LIKES,THE EVERSION IS LIKE A THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WEN WHERE WATER FALLS DOWN LIKE A A CREEK DEPOSITION IS LIKE LAKES
105,THE SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE AND SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO SINCE SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE IT MIXED AROUND SOLUTION A SINCE IT WENT AT THE TOP,THE SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE IN SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO SINCE SOLUTION BE IS MORE DENSE IT MAKS TE ROUND SOLUTION A SINCE IT WENT AT THE TOP
106,OH ONCE YOU BEND THERE'S LITTLE CHEMICALS INSIDE IT AND ONCE YOU BEND IT THEY BREAK AND THE LIGHT STARTS TO COME OUT,OH ONCE YOU BEN THERE'S LITTLE CHEMICALS INSIDE IT AND WON SHE BEND IT THEY'D BREAK AND LIGHTSTAIRS TCOME OUT
107,THEY PUT BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE IN A CUP WITH NOTHING IN IT THEN THEY GRABBED A CUP OF WATER WITH FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND MIXED IT WITH THE BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THEN MADE A PREDICTION,GE BAKING SODA AND CLATIM ORITE AN A CUP WITH NOTHING IN IT THEN HOW NEG TE GREVED A CUP OF WATER WITH BETTY MILILETERS O WATER AND MIXED IT WITH THE BAKO SODA AN CLASSI CLORA AND I MADE A PREDIBTION
108,THE BAKING SODA THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE THE WATER GETS MIXED IN AND THEN TIME PASSES LIKE THREE DAYS AND THEN COMES THE PRECIPITATION THING THE,THER BECKIN SODA THE CLUCIUM CLORIDE THE WATER GETS MIXED IN AND THEN TIME PASSES LIKE THREE DAYS AND THEN ER COMES A PREDIPTETATION THINK OF MUTE HICKY
109,THERE'S WATER WITH LIKE BAKING SODA NO THERE WAS JUST LIKE REGULAR WATER IN TWO CUPS AND THEN IT GOT MIXED TOGETHER AND MADE THIS WHITE WATER,OH THERE WAS WATER WITH LIKE BAKING SODA O THER WAS JUST LIKE REGULAR WATER IN TWO CUPS AND THEN IT GOT MIXED TOGETHER AND MADE THIS WHIT WATER
110,THE SALT GOES INTO THE WATER AND THE THE SALT BECOMES PART OF THE WATER AND THE GRAINS ARE DRIFTING TO THE BOTTOM,THE SALT GOES INTO THE WATER AND THE THE SOT BECOMES PART OF THE WATER AND THE GRAINS ARN SHE SINK TO THE BOT

202,THAT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS NO ACTUALLY IT'S NOT GONNA BE FIFTY FIFTY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LESS THAN FIFTY BUT I CAN'T PINPOINT EXACTLY THE C,THAT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY DEGREE SAUCIUS O COLA IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FITFIFTY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LESS THAN FIFTY BUT I CAN'T PIN POINT EXACTLY THE C
203,E AND THEN THIS IS THREE THREE IT'S NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS LIKE EIGHTEEN AND THIS IS LIKE EIGHT,AND THEN THIS IS THREE THREE X NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS LIKE EIGHTEEN ATHIS IS LIKE EIGHT
204,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS ONE IS LOWER THE THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS ONE'S THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY YES THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY,WHAT'S GOING ON AS THIS ONE IS LOWER THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS AN'S THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY
205,OR AT SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE THE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU PUT IN IT,OR SOME POINT IT DOES THAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU PLURED IN IT
206,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S HA GONNA HAPPEN IS B'S ACTUALLY GONNA OVERCOME THE A,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREED SULSIUS IN WHAT'S HOUT GOING TO HAPPEN IS BE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO OVERCOME THE A
207,WHAT WE DID WAS WE POURED ICE INTO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERO IT TURNED INTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE NEGATIVE FIVE CELSIUS COLDER,WHAT WE DID WAS E POURED ICE INTO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERA TURNED INTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE I GOT UP FIVE SOLSUS COLDER
208,AND THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AND THEN MINUTES AFTER ONE M MINUTE IT W IT WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES,AND THEN IN TWO HOURS HE WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AND THEN BMINUTES AFTER ONE MINUTE IWAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES
209,UH HE'S GONNA DIP IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT FRIES CIRCUITS AND THEN HE DIE,HE'S CINO DIP IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WIL WAT HAPPEN AS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT ID FRID CIRCITS AND THEN HE DIE
210,WELL THE VIALS WELL W THE VIALS COULD DO IS THEY'D LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS,WELL THE VILES WHAT THE VILES COULD DO AS THEY'D LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS
211,UM NOT E NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK IS WE FILLED UH BABY DIAPER WITH WATER AND IT GOT LIKE REALLY BIG YEAH SERIOUSLY,AM NOT NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK AS W FILLED A BABY DIPER WITH WATER AND IT GOT LIK REALLY BIG YES SERIOUSLY
212,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OF LIQUID BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO IT FOR OR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE LEMONADE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OR SIMIL OR LE LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THERE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT A LEMONADE STAND AND ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THEY WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,THOSE MARKS WER WERE A STANDARD MEASURMENT OFPULIQUID BECQOCNY DO IT FORE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE LEMONADE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OR SOMEN OR LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THERE THERES TWO PEOPLE AT A LEMONADE STAND AND ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY TWE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT
213,WHEN WE WEIGHED STUFF IN LIQUID IN LIQUID OR WHAT SOLIDS WE USED GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAW THAT UM TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE KILOGRAM IS A THOUSAND GRAMS,WHEN WE WEIGHD STUFF IN LIQUID IN LIQUID OR WHAT SOLID WE USED GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SOVE THAT OM TWO KILEGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE KILEGRAM IS A THOUSAND GRAMS
214,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOILET PLUNGER LIKE A DA LIKE A UH NEEDLE THING LIKE YEAH YEAH LIKE,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOIL ET PLUNGER LIKE A DOT LIKE A A NEET OLD THING LIKE YE YA LIKE
215,WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER,WHAT THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER
216,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AN MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH
217,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAW ON THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAD TO TAPE THEM E TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAWIN THE NUMBERS BUT D WE HAVE TO TAPE THEM A TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL AD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS T ONE METER
218,WHAT WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANSWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE Y WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU G IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,WEWHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ASER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT
219,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING
220,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE AS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AN THE OTHER CLASS MADE TEN  THE ELDER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THERE O DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM
221,WE WE IN TODAY'S MATH STUMPER WE WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS L ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS,WE WE IN TO DAY'S MATH STUMPER WE LE HADTO ISID ASKED THE MATE IS IT ASKD THE MATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS
222,NO BOTH WAYS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETER OH NOT THE PERIMETER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YEAH YEAH,NO BOTH WUS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN TIS PRIMITER OH NOT TO PERMURTER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YE I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YET YET
223,WELL H H I WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG,WELL I WOUN WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOURE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GIF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG
224,WELL WELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS,WELL WHAT WEVE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILIMETERS METERS
225,IS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT,I'S BECAUSE YOUAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL GIDET
226,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REAL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTOR'S USE YEAH,Y HEAWE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGERIN NOLAG AREL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTORS USE LIPIS ERANGE YE
227,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S ABOUT IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK
228,AND WE SQUIRT SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS ARE LIKE THAT BIG,AND WE SQSEE HOW MANY VILES I THAT THE PLUNDER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VILES ARE LIKE THAT BITK
229,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASED THE MO OF BATTERIES AM LAKE LAKE TIRD LIKE WHEN I RAPPED AROUND UN O RINTS IT PICKED UP THER DY WASHES CASAD TWO BATTER
230,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSE SER CE UM AM IT CONNECTS THE WASHES STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TUCKET I DOES
231,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINUSED THE LINE TO SEVEN I MADE TO TU ON UM IAD NESED THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
232,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT I DISCOVER IS WHEN I PUT MOR RAPP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT AM A MORM A WASHER STICK TO I
233,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WEL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED WINGS OM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUP BEFORE  IT ONLY PICKED UP I ONLY PICKED UUUUP TOM WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS TO I ADDED UP A FIVE MORE
234,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,MINCREASE WEN I DOA  PICKS UP TO THE LOWER CASONA PUT HER UP TO THIRTY A PICKED UP AT LHEWAT OR OPENING BUT IT SOA HUNDRED WINDS I AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH
235,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,WHAT TE PORIN IS THERE IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS A O IT HAS TO BE AT ISA CLOS CIRCLE EVERYTHING
236,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TUTY SELLS WORK WITH THE AVERSE ON DECEL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES ER GOES UP TO
237,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT ISN'T ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLYING THROUGH BECAUSE ANY SO BE TURNED AROUND A AMISTER ANDREWS CAF TO HAVE A MUGEDIM IN THE POSOF ECLASE OA CAR TOUCHING EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO RATMIK TE LIGHTBOLSLIT
238,UM IT WILL IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,UM IT'LL IT'LL DELIGHTFUL JUNTION BRIGHT AND BREGULAR ERCCAK LIKE TITALIT AND TEFURNITA
239,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES US A CIRCUIT IS UM WHE WHEN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE DESAL BETTY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CISSHING WIRE AND THE BASING WI
240,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I OBSERVE IS WHEN YOU I JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TO LIGHT BOBS IT'LL ITL BE DULL AND A WONT SHIPRIGHT BUT IF YOU HAD TWO BATTERIES IT'LL ONLY TWO LIGHT BOLB CHAMBRADER
241,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,SI THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS TIT IT WILL SHIT LOWER AND LOWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT A BATTERY WITH BATTERYU PUT THE
242,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE JESIL BATTERY AND IT WHAT BOTH TE LIRES HAS TO BE ON A BASIN WIRE AND ON A CASINWIRE
243,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,UM IT'S NO USE TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAS GREEN LIME AND IT'S PUSTBE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
244,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S EN BECAUSE ISPERREFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOUR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
245,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,WERT HOWEV REFLECKS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE ATO VIOLET AR PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED
246,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,O WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURN DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YA IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CARTIT'S WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE
247,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGET WAS YOUR NEST WAS TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETMAMANTICINA
248,THE MAGNET THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNET THE MAGNET IS OM O IS UNDERD LIK STOCK AND IN GEORGIES MOVE IN THE MAGNET AN THE PAPER CLO CASNOW WANTED TEM CONNECTED TO
249,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT IS THE VONUBALIAD ON SPACERBREAKS IST FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM IS NOT REALLY ETSTIK ON
250,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS AN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAK MAGNETS AND OOTHER CUP TO SEE MHOW MANY AM WASHES A BREAK O THE MAGNETS FALL
251,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEY GIVE FOR THEIR PART THE FIRST FORC COS A WEAKER BECAUSE THEREIS THE MOTHER MAGNETS MAGNETISM AND FORCE OF THE HORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER
252,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WAT'S GOING ON HEREFWHEN THY PRESS BACERS WHEN I AD THEM TH MAKNAK GETS TALLER BUT THE RAGNIKS ARE STILL TOUCHING ECH OTHER
253,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES AM MAKES THE FOS KIND O WEAKER ECURWICR INSTADER BEING STRONGER HAN USUALLY THE FORCIT
254,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,BUT I'VE NOTICEIS WHEN ITS LESS THAN ONE'S LIKE WHEN IT''S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER A THE MAGNET CAL HOLD THE PAPER
255,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S SUFFERING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORSE BOWIN BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL AN A MUMMY THAT KIND OF A A THE KIND OOOF AMMUM MAGNET IN THEM THAT'S ALL IHAP
256,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THIS VA ONCE WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPER CLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF IT
257,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL WITH THE THIN ONE IT WAS LIKE OONE I GUESS LER I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER TO A TASY BCAUSE IT'S THICK IN THE T A WILOF A LOT AN THEN I SAW TE MISEMENTS GOING LIKE THAT AND YOU'R KIND OF LIKE MY
258,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE THICK PIECE  PEOPER IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK AND THE THIN WONA KAT BEGINS ITS OVY
259,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WEVE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT AM HAAKIT THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET CIS SO ON IT SO STRONG THA COULD GO THROUGH A NAIL IN ORDER TO HOLD A PAPER CL
260,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISN'T IT ACTING LIKE A MAGT A  LIKE WEWHY YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND N ELECTRICIT AND CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH ANDS TO MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND REACTS LIKE A METAL
261,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,EN I TO MAKE I ON I STICK TO THE BIBY CLUB BUT WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PIPER C
262,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT'S BECAUSE THER MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH NAPER GRAVNE AM PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S F
263,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET AND A NAL AND ITS FIRST KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
264,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,THINK IF I BOTH CONNECTED THEWISE THROUGH THE FACE FAL I WHAT IT REALLY WED BECOMES THIN PLASTIC IS HOLDI
265,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,AKTHE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN IT WOULD SWICH THE DECAL A IT CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE POSITIVE SLAB IS GOING TO ETHY DIRECTION
266,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,BUT I NOTICE THAT I DIDIT GIVE DELIHBAL HER LIFE TO ENSORE TO ALIGHT UP THE FIT WITH  ENERG
267,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATTERY HELPS WITH THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BALL TO HELP LIGHT IT ON AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
268,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S IMPORTANCE OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK CUGO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU TREAD THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH I TO GET THE MAG
269,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,THEWIE THE RIVE THOGH THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THATS WA THE AM ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY COKLED THOUG
270,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY STOS GOES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORSE OF THE FORCEOCHAPIC CANACTIVIS I ALL THE WASHES CONNECT AND E NEGOS THROU E AM POSITIVE SIGT THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVES
271,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BECAUSE ITS IRON OR STEEL SHE E MIRALY TIS A MIT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AN AN ONTO IT TO MAKE IT EME TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORC
272,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WILE THE CICUTR OF THE SPECH AT LEAST A SOMETHING HAS TO BE PLEGTUR OF A MAN NIK TE FORSOVE ELECTRICITY CA IS COL THROU SOMTHING THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE
273,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,ASTER HAPPEN AT THE RIVER AND THE WIRES IS AM AN AS TO AT LEAST CONNECTS A WAR OR AT LEAST DO SUBTIN TO
274,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WEL WHEN ITS OPEN SIRCE TAM  WLASHES DON'T STICK TO THE THEPPTHE MEDO TING AN EN ON ITS CLOSE CIRCIT IT STICKS
275,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN T GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT AGIVE MIT THE MAGNETIC COUR
276,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,PENSIVE WHEN IT HAS  CLOSER ATHE MAGNETIC FORCE IS A BLE TU SA WAT CONNECT WITH THE WATCHERS SAND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT OPEN IPIL
277,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,WA JIS WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH ITTHE WASHERS BECAUSE I HAS NO LONGE COMPEL IT TO THE WIRE
278,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF THE WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S SWITCHED IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF OF THE THING WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD AM NOTHING STIKS TOP BUT WHEN ITS FIXD IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING
279,UM WHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THE GUY HE'S LOOKING AT HIS REFLECTION AND YOU CAN STILL SEE IN THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF HOW THE MIRROR REFLECTS,FIR ED ORNING OM  WHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THAT GUY HE'S IKANARESFLECTION AND YOU  STILL SEE ON THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE TH WONT EAR HOW REFLEX
280,WHAT'S GOING ON IS FIRST OF THE MAGNET JUST THE ONE IS LET TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE ITS START SAME IN ABSENT,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET DOES'T WANT A LET TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IT'S NOT ESIT'S THE A SAME QUADRANT AND NO THE OPOSIT
281,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT IS SERIOUS OKAY WORKS WIRES SO AND GO GOING WHAT'S HAVE ONE WIRE AND IN THE,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS SIRCET WORKS IS RYA HASES UF AND GOS UF ORS APOANAN WARO HAVE ONE WIREING IN THE WOGR AT CO MEC IT NO
282,WHAT I THINK IT GOING ON HERE SINCE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT THE THINGS IS NOT ELSE AND THE NOTICED TO BECAUSE THE FILAMENT IT WILL BE ORDER GO TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB GIVEN ENERGY,BUT I THINK IT'S GOING ON HERE SINCE TWO LIGHT BULBS AR NOT THE ING ISNOWRE OUT IN ORDER TO PLACE AN AITAL AM LIGHT UP BECAUSE HE BILIMENT WI IWIL BE ON ORDERED TO GO THROUGH THE LETTER LIGHTE O TIK ADVAANTAGE
283,WE TALKED AT AND THINGS THAT STICK TILL ON MAGNET SPILLING ABOUT IRION TELL ME ABOUT IRON AND WHY JUST THIS STICK TO REFRIGERATOR AND HOW MAGNETS ARE USED,WE TALKED ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS THAT STICK TO UM MAGNETS WE LEARNED ABOUT IRON TELLING ME ABOUT IRON AND UM WHY DOES IT STICK TO A REFRIGERATOR AND HOW MAGNETS ARE USED
284,THE BLACK ROCK EITHER GREEN ROCK BECAUSE GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT WILL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE HAS THE SAME THING NOT IN THE OCEAN THAT STICK TO MAGNET,THE BLACK ROCK ARE THE GREEN ROCK BECAUSES TA GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT ILL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE IT HAS A CERTAIN THING THAT'S IN THE OCEAN THAT'S BLACK THAT STICKS TO MAKN
285,WELL IT BECAUSE ITS STILL LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE IS NOT ELECTRICITY TO GO RUN THROUGH EACH,WHIL IT'S BECAUSE ITS TWO LIGHT BOBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO GO RUN THROUGH EACH
286,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP,WHAT'S GOING ON IS AM THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE RIBOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP
287,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND FOR HAPPENS IS RUNNING CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT HELP TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND PERHAPPIS INSPENLY CONNECTED TO BATTERY IT HELPED ME TETHER LIHT A LIGHT LITO E SHADY
288,WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT BULBS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH HIM AND RELATED IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE LIKE,WHAT I OBSERVE ABOUT THE BULBS AND AS THEIR ENERGIES GOING THROUGH EM AND I RELEACES IT AN IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO THE LIGHT
289,WHAT'S GOING ON IT GONE OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH BUT STILL USING THE SAME THING BUT NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND BY THE,WHAT'S GOING ON IS ITS GOING OUT THE BATTER EN THROUGH BUT STILL USIN THE SAME THING BUT THE GAT AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY IN ORDER TO LIGHT UP
290,WHAT I OBSERVE THE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I OBSERVE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THE ENERGY'S GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND GOING TO BOTH THE LIGHT BOPS
291,WHAT I THINK WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS M IS IT A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
292,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T NOT LIGHTING WERE AND WHAT NOW ITS LIGHTING SO BRIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE,WHAT I NOTICE IS THE LIGHT BULP IS IN NOT LIGHTING WELL WHEN WELL NOW ITS LIGHTING S SO BRIGHT BBECAUSE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED T THE OPPOSITE SIDE
293,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB WHEN BACK OUT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB BACK UP,THAT'S GOING ON WITH THA ELECTRICITY ITS GOIN THO TE LIPOL THEN BACK OUT THOUG E LITGART O THE BAKCAT
294,I THINK THE CIRCUIT ONE TOP BECAUSE THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND AN XC BUT LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY BRIGHT,I THINK THE SECOND ONE TOP BECAUSE THERE'S A LIGHT BALV AND I SE BOTH THE LIGHTROBS ARE SHINING REALLY BRIGHT
295,OH WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES THE MORE ENERGY SOME MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU CAN LIGHT UP THERE IS ENOUGH NOT YOU ELECTRICITY FOR,WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BETTER TO ONE LIGHE PULP IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY THE MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU LIGHT UP THERE'S NOT ENOUGH JUICE OR ANGIEUR ELECTRICITY FOR IT
296,UM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THEY WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE THEY HAD POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WOULD REPEL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD UM GO TOGETHER YES,AM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THER WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE NED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WERE TO REPEL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD A GO TOGETHER YES
297,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEY'LL REPEL IF IT THEY'RE LIKE NORTH AND NORTH THEY REPEL AND IF THEY'RE SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEI'LL REPEL IF THEY'RE LIKE THE NORTH AND NORTH THEY'LL REPEL AND IF THEYRE'S OIN STOTHIN COMENCES REPEL
298,YEAH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT UM THEY ALL GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THERE AND DOWN AGAIN THROUGH THE WIRE,YA I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AM HE'LL GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THERE AND DOWN AGAIN THROUGH THE WIRE
299,YEAH THEY'RE ATTRACTING SO THEY HOOK TOGETHER EXCEPT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY HOOK TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S UM THE TABLE IS IN FRONT OF IT,YE EXAY THEY'RE ATTRACTING SO THEY HOOK TOGETHER EXCEPT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY HOOK TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S ATHE TABLE IS IN FRONT OF IT
300,UM THE WIRES ARE USED FOR CONNECTING ON THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BASE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO GIVE IT LIKE POWER,OM THE WIRES ARE USED FOR CONNECTING ON THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BASE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO GIVE IT LIKE POWER
301,UH WELL THERE IS THE FILAMENT WHICH IT GETS WARM AND IT LIGHTS UP CAUSE IT THE LIGHT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH TO LIGHT IT UP,AH WELL THEREIS THE FILAMENT WHICH IT GETS WARM AND IT LIGHTS UP CAUSE THE LIGHT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH TO LIGHT IT UP
302,THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES SO YOU'RE GONNA CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THE BATTERY TO LIGHT TO LIGHT THEM UP,THERE IS TWO LIGHT VOLVES AND WIRES SE YOU'RE GOING TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BALBS IN THE BATTERY TO LIGHT TO LIGHT THEM UP
303,UM SO THE MAGNET THE MAGNETIC ELESIS ELECTRICITY WILL BE FL FLOWING THROUGH THE NAIL AND IT CAN PICK THE PAPER CLIP UP,AM SO THE MAGNET THE MAGNETICALIST ELECTRICITY WILL BE FLOWING THROUGH THEI NAIL AND IT CAN PICK THE PAPER CLUB UP
304,BECAUSE ON THIS ONE THE POSITIVE SIDE IS WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE BASE AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND THIS ONE N THERE'S BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTING IT'S THE ONE WE JUST DID WHERE THERE'S A CIRCUIT,BECAUSE ON THIS ONE THE POSITIVE SIDE IS WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE BASE AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND THIS ONE THERE'S BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTING IT'S THE ONE WE JUST DID WHERE THERE'S THE CIRCUIT
305,UM THAT THE POWER OF THE BATTERY IS PUSHING IT THROUGH THERE UP INTO THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AGAIN AND GOING THROUGH THERE AND THEN LIKE REUSING THE POWER,AM THAT THE POWER OF THE BATTERY IS PUSHING IT THROUGH THERE UP INTO THE PILEMENTS AND DOWN AGAIN AND GOING THROUGH THERE AND THEN LIKE REUSING THE POWER
306,UH IT'S SHOWING IF YOU CONNECT UM ONE WIRE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE RIGHT THERE THAT IT'LL UM IT WON'T MAKE IT LIGHT UP SO YOU'LL HAVE TO HOOK THE OTHER WIRE UP T TO THE UM BOTTOM OF IT TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,AIT SHOWING IF YOU CONNECT OM ONE WIRE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE RIGHT THERE THAT IT'LL  IT WON'T MAKE I LIGHT UP SO YOU'LL HAVE TO HOOK THE OTHER WIRE UP TO THE BOTTOM OF IT TO MAKE A LIGHT UP
307,WELL YES IT CAN MAGNETISM CAN GO THROUGH THINGS UM UM IF I TAKE TWO MAGNETS THIS IS WHAT I OBSERVED I TAKE TWO MAGNETS AND I HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER OR CARDBOARD I S PUT THEM TOGETHER AND THEY STICK,WELL YES EMAGNETISM CAN GO THROUGH THINGS AM DOUM IF I TAKE TWO MAGNETS THIS IS WHAT I OBSERVED I TAKE TWO MAGNETS AND AV A PIECE OF PAPER OR CARDBOARD IPUT THEM TOGETHER AND THEY STICK
308,WHEN THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL THE MAGNET BECOMES A TEMPORARY MAGNET SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK TO THE NAIL,WHEN THE MAGNEC IS STICKING TO THE NAIL THE MAGNET BECOMES A TEMPORARY MAGNET SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK TO THE NAIL
309,UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU FLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES THEM APART,UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU FLUP A MAGNET AND YOU TRY TO PUSH EM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES THEM APART
310,WELL BECAUSE UM THE BECAUSE THE MAGNET CAN ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE OTHER METALS IT CAN'T REALLY STICK TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY METAL IT'S LIKE COPPER ALUMINUM FOIL,WELL BECAUSE UM THE BECAUSE THE MAGNET CAN ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE OTHER METALS IT CAN'T REALLY STICK TO BECAUSE IT''S NOT REALLY METAL IT'S LIKE COPPER  ALIMINUM OIL
311,THE MAGNET FORCE ISN'T MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S UM IN BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S AM IN BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD
312,THE MAGNET FORCE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PENCIL UM THERE ISN'T MUCH MAGNET FORCE BUT IN THE MIDDLE THERE'S A LOT OF MAGNET FORCE AND THEN AT THE TOP THERE'S MORE MAGNET FORCE,THE MAGNET FORCE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PENCIL UMS THERE ISN'T MUCH MAGNET FORCE BUT IN THE MIDDLE THERE'S A LOT OF MAGNET FORCE AND THEN AT THE TOP THERE'S MORE MAGNET FORCE
313,WELL FOR THE RIVET TO ACT LIKE A MAGNET IS FOR EITHER WIRE WRAPPED AROUND IT YEAH WIRE WRAPPED AROUND IT FOR IT TO WORK,OR FOR THE RIVET TO ACT LIKE NO MAGNET IS FOR EITHER WHYRE WRAPPED AROUND IT YE WHY WRAPPED AROUND IT FOR IT TO WORK
314,WELL THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY CAN WORK WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KINDA CONNECT TO,WILE THE FOU F ELECTRICITY CAN WORK WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KIND OF CONNECT TO
315,WELL ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE BATTERY AND THEN THE SWITCH BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SWITCH YOU COULDN'T TURN ON AND OFF AND IT WOULD RUN THE BATTERY OUT AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BATTERY IT WOULDN'T WORK,WELL ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE BATTERY ANDHEN THE SWITCH BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SWITCH YOU COULDN'T TURN ON AND OFF AND IT WOULD RUN THE BATTERY OUT AND IF YOU DIDN'T HA A BATTERY IT WOULDN'T WORK
316,WELL FOR THE FIRST ANSWER THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET AND WHAT'S UP WITH THAT IS THAT WHEN IT'S WRAPPED AROUND IT CAN PICK UP ME METAL OBJECTS,FOR THE FIRST DANCER THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVID AND WHAT'S UP WITH THAT IS THAT WHEN IT'S WRAPPED AROUND IT CAN PICK UP MEMETAL OBJECTS
317,THAT THERE'S ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND ONE SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY,THAT THEREIS ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH IN THE BATTERY AND ONE SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH IN THE BATTERY
318,WELL IF IT FLOWS THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND INTO THE POSITIVE THEN AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN,LL IGEFOS SOM A NEGUTIVE END INTO THE POSITIVE TEN AND THERE IT GOES THROUGH THE D CEL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN
319,UM I NOTICED THAT THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT HAS THE LIGHT BULB SHINING WHICH ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT DOESN'T HAVE A LIGHT BULB SHINING IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE SHARING WIRES,AM I NOTICED THAT THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT HAS TLIGHT BUB SHINING WHICH ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT DOESN'T HAVE A LIGHT BUB SHINING IT'S BECAUSE THEY'E SHARING WIRES
320,WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM A NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE WELL IT'S FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND INTO POSITIVE AND IT'S GOING IN A CIRCUIT,WHILE TH ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE WELL IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE INTO THE LIGHT BULVE OUT TO THE LIGHT BULE AND INTO POSITIVE AND ITS GOING IN A CIRCUIT
321,WELL ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T BRIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT,WELL ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T BRIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT
322,IT TELLS ME THAT ONE HEN IS IS LIKE HET HE MORE BIGGER SO IT HOLDS HOLDS LESS AND THE OTHER HOLDS LIKE MORE ER THAN THE THE GROUP ONE,IT TELLS ME THAT ONE IN IS IT'S LIKE HEAP MORE BIGGER SO WHOIT HOLDS HOLDS LESS AN THE OTHER HOLDS HOLD LIKE MORE ER THAN THE AGRUPON
323,UM THEY CONNECT BECAUSE IT'S CAUSE WHEN IT GETS TO ONE THOUSAND THOUSAND AND ONE AND HUNDRED HUNDRED AND TWO TH ONE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED THEN ONE THOUSAND IT'S H ALL MILLILITERS HERE'S,I'M THICKIN NEGTIT BECAUSE IS IS WHEN IT GETS ONE THOUSAND HOSIN AM O AN HUNDRED MDRED IN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED AD SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED HUNDRED THEN ONE THOUSAND IT'S  ALL O MILL LEADERS HEES
324,I OBSERVED WAIT I OBSERVED THAT THAT LIKE EACH ONE AND LIKE ONE IS LIKE SMALLER AND AND THE TWO LIKE IF THE CYLINDER ILINDER WITH THE HOLDING HOLDING IN THE BUCKET THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE SO THEY HOLD THE SAME ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER,I OBSERVE I OBSERVED THAT AT LIKE EACH ONE AND LIKE ONE IS LIKE SMALLER AN IN THE TWO LIKE THE CYLINDER LINDE WITH THE HOLDING HOLDING INTHE BUCKET THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE SO THEY HOLD THECAME ALMOST THE SAME AMOUN WATER
325,UM WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER WATER AND AND LIKE UM AND LIKE SPONGES SPONGE DRY SPONGES AND WET SPONGES SPONGES AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING ING LOT'S OF OTHER STUFF THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF,AM WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER OTER AND AND LIKE AND LIKE PONGES HUNGED DRY SPONGES AND WET SPONGES HUNDES AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING IN LOTS OF OTHER STUFF THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF
326,THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WATER IS LIGHTER THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WITH SALT IN IT BECAUSE THE SALT MAKES THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER HEAVIER,THE FIFTY MILLITERS OF WATER WATER IS LIGHTER THAN THE FIFTY MILLITERS OF WATER WITH SALT IN IT BECAUSE THE SALT MAKES THE FIFTY MILLITERS OF WATER HEAVIER
327,THAT IS CALLED SATURATION WHICH IS WHEN WHEN YOU PUT UM TOO MUCH SOLID AND SOLUTION WHEN SO IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE,THAT IS CALLED SATURATION WHICH IS WHEN WHEN YOU PUT UM TOO MUCH SOLID IN SOLUTION WHEN SO IT DOESN'T DISSOL
328,THE EPSOM SALT IS A SPIKY NEEDLED NEEDLED ONE THE SALT IS THE SQUARED ONE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE CITRIC ACID IS A CLEAR WHITE,THE EPSON SALT IS A SPIKY NEEDLED NEEDLED M ONE THE SALT IS THE SQUARED ONE NTHE MIDDLE AND THE SIXTURE ACTED IS A FAST CLEAR WHITE CRYST
329,THAT THE ONE I CLICKED ON RIGHT NOW IS CITRIC ACID NO THIS IS THIS ONE IS CITRIC ACID THIS ONE IS SALT AND THIS ONE IS EPSOM SALT,THUT THE ONE I CLICKED ON RIGHT NOW IS CUTRIC ACID NOT THIS IS THIS ONE IS SIXTRIC ACID THIS ONE IS SALT AND THIS ONE IS ABSENT SALT
330,WE CAN WEIGH WE CAN PUT WEIGHT IN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF NORMAL WATER AND THEN HOWEVER HOWEVER MANY THINGS IT WEIGHS ON THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SOLIDITY CHART AND IT HAS SUBSTANCE ONE IN IT SO,WE CAN WEIG WE CAN PUT WEIGHTS IN THE FIFTEEN MILIONS OF NORMAL WATER AND THEN HOWVE ABIVIT HOWEVER MANY THINGS IT WEIGHS AND THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE CSELIBITY CHART AND  HAV SUBSTANT ONE IN IT SO
331,THE THE LIGHTER ONE IS IS ON THE TOP AND THE AND THE HEAVIER ONE GOES TO THE BOTTOM EXCEPT IF YOU PUT THEM IN,THE THE LIGHTER ONE IS ONIS ON THE TOP AND THE AND THE HEAVIER ONE IS GOES TO THE BOTTOM XCEPT IF YOU PUT THEM IN N
332,THAT THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN FIVE GRAMS SOLUTION B IS LESS DENSE I MEAN SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE THAN FIVE GRAMS AND SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE,THAT THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN FIVE GRAMS SOLUTION B IS LESS DENSE I MEIN SOLUTION A IS LESS TENS THAN FIVE GRAMS AND THE SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE
333,THE UM SALT UM DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND IT'S STILL PART OF THE WATER IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S STILL IN THE WATER,THE UM SALT M DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND IT'S STILL PART OF THE WATER IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S STILL IN THE WATER
334,I THINK THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MIX IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DOES,I THINK THE SANDAN WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MIX IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE SALT IN WATER MIXTURE DOES
335,I THINK THE UM SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE SAND AND AND WATER MIXTURE BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T,I THINK THE UM SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE BEAS THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T
336,ONE OF THEM IS MORE IN SOLUTION A THE FIVE GRAMS IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND IN SOLUTION B THE FIVE GRAMS IS LESS THAN THE WATER SOLUTION A MUST HAVE SOMETHING SOME SOLUTION B MUST HAVE SOMETHING ADDED TO IT,ONE OF THEM IS MORE IN SOLUTION A THE FIVE GRAMS IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND IN SOLUTION B THE FIVE GRAMS IS LESS TENSE THAN THE WATER SOLUTION A MUST HAVE SOMETHING SOME SOLUTION B MUST HAVE SOMETHING ADDED TO IT
337,BECAUSE THE THE LIGHTER SOLUTION TRIES TO GO UP TO THE TOP BUT IT IT IT AND THAT IT MIXES TOGETHER WITH THE HEAVIER SOLUTION,BECAUSE THE UM THE LIGHTER SOLUTION TRIES TO GO UP TO THE TOP BUT IT IT IN THAT IT MIXES TOGETHER WITH THE HEAVIER SOLU
338,BECAUSE YOU BECAUSE THE THE LESS DENSE ONE GOT PUT IN FIRST WHEN IT TRIES TO FLOAT UP TO THE TOP THE THE DENSER ONE AND IT MIXES TOGETHER,BECAUSE YOU BECAUSE THE M THE LAST DENSE ONE GOT PUT IN FIRST AND WHEN IT TRIES TO FLOAT UP TO THE TOP THE THEN THE DENSER ONE AND IT MIXS TOGETHER
339,THE LESS DENSE ONE WAS PUT IN FIRST AND THE MORE DENSE ONE WAS PUT IN LAST SO THEY MIXED TOGETHER,THE LESS DENSE ONE WAS PUT IN FIRST AND THE MORE DENS ONE WAS PUT IN LAST SO THEY MIXED TOGETHER
340,THE THE PENNY IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER AND I MEAN THE THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER SO IT FLOATS,THE UM THE PENNY IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER AND I MEAN THE THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER SO IT FLOATS
341,BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID EARLIER I KNOW LOOK I'M NOT HOLDING MY SPACE BAR AND IT'S STILL ON IT'S,BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID EARLIER I KNOW TGAN TIGAN TAGAN LOOK I'M NOT HOLDING MY SPACE BAR AND IT'S STI ON ITS
342,THAT THE REACTANTS HAVE HAVE WHITE AND ALL DIFFERENT COLORS IN IT AND THEY MIX TOGETHER AND AND IN THE PRODUCT AND MAKE DIFFERENT COLORS,A D REACTTINHAVE HAVE WHITE AND ALL DIFFERENT COLORS IN IT AND THEY MIX TOGETHER A ANIN THE PRODUCT AND MAKE DIFFERENT COLORS
343,THAT IS A HARDNESS SCALE ABOUT HOW HARD ROCKS ARE YEAH AND MINERALS MINERAL MINERAL I'M SMART OKAY GIVE ME A GOOD GRADE,THAT IS A HARDNE SCALE ABOUT HOW HARD ROCKS ARE YA AND MINERALS MINERAL MINOMRO I'M SMART OKAY GIVE ME GOOD RED
344,ONE IS LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE BECAUSE THE ONE THAT IS HEAVIER COLLECTED GAS AND THE ONE THAT IS LIGHTER DIDN'T,ONE IS LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE BECAUSE ETHE ONE THAT IS HEAVIER COLLECTED GAS IN T ONE THAT IS LIGHTER DID IT
345,MMM HMM LIKE UM WE HAVE RUBBER BANDS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA DO LIKE THREE RUBBER BANDS AND THEY THINK THAT IT'LL BE IN LESS LINES FOR THE PROPELLER,UMHU LIKE UM WE HAVE ROVERBANDS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DEAL LIKE THREE RUBBERMANS AND THEY THINK THAT IT'LL BE IN LESS WINES FOR THE PROPELLER
346,MAYBE IT'S CAUSE YOU WOULD GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER LIKE IF YOU DID MASS WAIT IF YOU DID LIKE RUBBER BANDS AND FORCE FOR THE FAN MAYBE IT YOU WOULDN'T GET THE SAME ANSWER AS YOU WOULD JU FOR JUST THE FAN OR JUST THE RUBBER BANDS,MAYBE IT'S CAUSE YOU WOULD GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER LIKE IF YOU DIDN' MASS WAIT IF YOU DID LIKE RUBBER BANDS AND FORCE FOR THE FAN MAYBE ITYOU WOULDN'T GET THE SAME ANSWER AS WOULD FOR JUST THE FAN OR JUST THE RUBBER BAND BECAUS MY M
347,UM WE'VE BEEN JUST LIKE A LOT TIMES WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES HALFWAY AND HOW FAR IT GOES ALL THE WAY AND WITHOUT IT LIKE WE DID LIKE EIGHTY TWO AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY BUT IT THEN IT BOUNCED OFF THE CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THEN WE TRIED SIXTY AND THAT HAD A LITTLE BOUNCE AND THEN WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND THAT WAS PERFECT IT LIKE STOPPED RIGHT AT THE CHAIR,UM WE'VE BEEN JUST LIKE A LOT OF TIMES WEN'VE BEEN SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES HALFWAY AND HOW FAR IT GOES ALL THE WAY AND WITHOUT IT LIKE WE DID LIKE EIGHTY TWO AND IGOT ALL THE WAY BUT IT THEN IT BOUNCED OFF THE CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT WE TURED SIXTY AND THAT HAD A LITTLE BOUNCE AND THEN WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND THAT WAS PERFECT I LIKE STOPPED RIGHT AT THE CHAIR
348,YEAH UM WE LIKE HOW WE MADE IT WE TOOK UM FISHING LINE THE REALLY STRONG STUFF AND UM WE DUCT TAPED IT TO A CHAIR OF FOUR METERS AND THEN WE TAPED IT TO ANOTHER CHAIR AND THEN WE ATTACHED OUR PLANE UM TO THE FISHING LINE AND UM OUR PLANE IS MADE OUT OF STRAWS LIKE DRINKING STRAWS UM AND RUBBER BANDS AND UH POPSICLE STICKS AND WHEN WE WIND IT UP UM MY GROUP ENDE MY GROUP AND I WE GOT SIXTY AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY LIKE IT GOES BY ITSELF WITHOUT US T T TOUCHING IT OTHER THAN WINDING IT AND THE IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CHAIR,YA UM WE LIKE HOW WE MADE IT WE TOOK AM FISHING LINE THORALHLY STRONG STUFF AND UM WE DUCK TAPED IT TO A CHAIR OF FOUR METERS AND THEN WE TAPED IT TO ANOTHER CHAIR AND THEN WE ATTACHED OUR PLAN UM TO THE FISHING LINE AND AM OUR PLAN IS MADE OUT OF STRAWS LIKE DRINKING STRAWS UM AND RUBBERBANDS AND  POPSCOOLSTICKS AND WHEN WE WIND IT UP AM MY GROUP INTO MY GROUP AND I WEGOT SIXTY AND I GOT ALL THE WAY LIKE IT GOES BY ITSELF WITHOUT US TOUTO TOUCHING IT OTHER THAN WINDING IT AND THO IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THEATHIR CHAIR
349,LIKE WE WE HAD TO DO WE HA WE GUESSED LIKE FOR MAYBE IF YOU HAVE FIFTEEN AND THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE IT JUST STAYED IN IT'S PLACE SO ONE REALLY BIG VARIABLE IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER FOR THE PLANE,LIKE WE WE HAD TO DO WE WE GUESSED LIKE FOR MAYWEHA FIFTEEN AND THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE IT JUST STAYED IN ITS PLACE SO ONE REALLY BIG VARIABLE IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER FOR THE PLANE
350,TO IF EVERYONE WAS DOING LIKE THE SAME VARIABLE IT WOULD TAKE A LONGER TIME TO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF EVERYBODY DID THE SAME VARIABLE AND THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES SO I GUESS IT'S UH,TILL IF EVERYONE WAS DOING LIKE THE SAME VARIABLE IT WOULD TAKE A LONGER TIME TO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF EVERYBODY DID THE SAME VARIABLE AND THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLE SIGUS IS A MATHEW AS
351,YEAH WE GET FISHING LINE AND WE DECK LIKE WE GET A PIECE OF DUCT TAPE AND WE LIKE PUT IT RIGHT HERE AND IT'S LIKE UM IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE CHAIRS TOGETHER IT SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE VERY SPREAD APART SO IT'S LIKE REALLY TIGHT AND THEN WE PUT OUR PLANE ON RIGHT UM RIGHT BEFORE WE PUT ON THE DUCT TAPE AND WE UM,YE WE GET FISHING LINE AND WE DECK LIKE WE GET A PECE O DUCK TAPE AND WELIK PUT IT RIGHT HERE AND ITS E COME IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE CHAIRS TOGETHER IT SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULD BE VERY SPREAD APART SO IT'S LIKE RILLY TIGHT AND THEN WE PUT OUR PLANE ON RIGHT OM RIGHT BEFORE WE PUT ON THE DECK TAPE AND WE AM
352,UH MMM CAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO ONE AT A TIME MMM A CA AND UH EACH TABLE GROUP IS A DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KINDA COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY THAT,ACAUSE I THINK WERE GOING TONDO ONE AT A TIME  AT CAND A EACH TABLE GROUP IS A DIFFERENT  VARIABLE SO THAT KIND O COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY TO HA
353,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHAIRS AND DUCT TAPED EM AND OUR WE WINED UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WAIT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASS ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES,AM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WWE'VE GOTTEN FISHLINE CHAIRS AND DECK TAPE DOM AND ART WE WIND UP THE PLAN WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND M THE PROPELLER UNTIL YOU WIND IT AND AM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WHA ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FORCE  THE MAST ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES
354,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALF WAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN
355,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO AT THE TOP OF THE POD AND THEN ARE GONNA GO DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF GOING DOWN LIKE UM MAYBE LIKE IN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING IS AT,YA AM SOME PEOPLE ARE ON LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GOI TO GO AP THE TOP OF THE PINE AND THEN Y'RE GOING TO GO DOWN THE STEPS AND  THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND AM JUST BYMIN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT A IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF COI DOWN LIKE A MAYBE LIKEIN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRIMG IS AT
356,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE A TWENTY MAYBE LIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE IN TWENTY MAYBE ALIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP
357,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,WELL OM BECAUSE AM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT AM WHAT WAS HALF WAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE AH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINCS DOES A PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY
358,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALF WAY AND ALL THE WAY AN DUM SOMETIMES WHEN WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE ARM CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN I LIKE CLATE
359,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,YE LIKE IT WON'T ITITI'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER WUD ME HADUBLE IT LIKE UM WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR ARPLANE W ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO WINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO SPIN MORE
360,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN I I MAY HAVE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOUL MESS UP THE WHOLE ERATE
361,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,WELL A WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO A MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MANY FANS AND WERE TTESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLAR
362,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WILL LIKE MY AM THE MANT GRE UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID AM THREE MAT THEY DID ONE SENNING LEANER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THE
363,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE O THAT COULD BE GOOD VARIABLE WED AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO A ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH OP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AN IOF THE CUP AHU AND FIVE INCHES AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN WHEN THE HEIGHT IS AM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS AHA AH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YATDE
364,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL  THE HEIGHTS M WE ITFOR SOME REASON OUR JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORD AND THE WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AND THE FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
365,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITAN E YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THE THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD U MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISEBOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISSHIP
366,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNY IS JUST TALL OF ASLEEP WE PUCR WE TRY TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LET GO TO THE SIDE
367,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASH PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
368,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,AM WILL ARCHIMINES I DON' PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF A QUESTNING M HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WITH THE MASS WITH THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK
369,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,AHU AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTYS AN THREE THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE
370,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OKIN AWELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT WAS WE TOOK THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I A THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL T ONE SIDE IT WAS GOING TO SINK EVEN FASTER SO
371,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CREWS BUILT MAYBE LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE M LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TAR IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT A GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT AM THE PEOPLE COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A GUDJILLION TIMES BIGGER SO
372,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YEP WEN THE THREETHE FOR THE THREE WEL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD PUT IT UP PERRE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARDER GUN SARIGT AH WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARDER GUN WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO AS LIKE DOWN HERE A DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREES DOWN HERE DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT AL AN WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE
373,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,AH GOOD WE GOT MORE THEN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND
374,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,OH UM WEL I THIN THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU AREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANT TO PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE AM IT'S LIKE NOT IS PIG TARTA
375,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT,WELL EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YE SOME PEOPLE GOT
376,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT IS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WL IM NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES
377,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MMM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBE TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK,WE THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLO LEADERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP UHM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBES TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLOLEEDERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLALEADERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THOEY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK
378,W WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THAT MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE,WMY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TMY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KIND O DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRID TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE
379,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UH ONE TO FIVE INCHES THAT YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND,AM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATERCUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING AH ONE TO FIVE INCHES A YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND  ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND
380,WE THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TWO Y WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND,WTHIS IS KIND OF ATOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TOO WHEN THEYR HAVED TO LEVEL OUT THEIR A WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO  YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND
381,UH OF THE CUP OF THE COFFEE UH HUH AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUB OF WATER EACH UH PERSON GOT WITH YOUR PARTNER AND SO WE GOT A CUP OF PENNIES AND WE JUST INDIVIDUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIFE BOAT CUP AND UM SO THEN WE BASICALLY JUST DROPPED EM IN AND MY PARTNER'S KINDA WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINK THAT'S BECAUSE MORE OF THE MASS WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDE SO THAT IT WAS SINKING MORE SO IF WE WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY PENNIES IT WOULD EVEN IT OUT WELL IT DID AND THEN WE KEPT PUTTING MORE LIKE IN THE CENTER HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE KNEW THAT THAT LAST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS UM THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LIFEBOAT,OF THE CUP OF THE COFFEE UHU AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUB OF WATER EACH A PERSON GOT WITH YOUR PARTNER AND SO WE GOT A CUP OF PENNIES AND WE JUST INDIVIDUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIFE BOAT CUP AND AM SO THEN WE BASICALLY JUST DROPPED IM IN AN MY PARTNER AS IN KIND A WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINK THAT'S BECAUSE MORE OF THE MAST WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDE SO IT WAS SINKING MORE SO IF WE WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WER THERE WASN'T ANY PENNIES IT WOULD EVEN IT OUT WELL IT DID AND THEN WE KEPT PUTTING MORE LIKE IN THE CENTR HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE KNEW THAT THAT LAST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS AM THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LIFE BOAT
382,UM WELL W THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT AND THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE,AM WELL THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT IN THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE
383,WELL UM WE W FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER WAIT NO EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST,WELL UM WE FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTMETER WE KNOW EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST
384,E I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO,II THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO DOWN HERE SO
385,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECI WELL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PENDULUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND IT W AND WHAT WE UH FOUND OUT IS W NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECIDE WILL AND WHERE WE STARTED A TO PUT THE PEGELUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND AND WHAT WE AD FOUND OUT IS NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
386,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IBUT THE MASTS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER
387,MMM HMM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER E WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE,M WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT AM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE A NUMBERS AND AM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE
388,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YOU WUD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE
389,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHITE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO BY ONE BY ONE UM WITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WRHITE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE A IT WAS LIKE O TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO ONE BY ONE AM WHAT THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE
390,YEAH UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN M UH WE DECIDED TO USE ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO,YA UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN A WE DECIDED O TO USE ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO
391,WELL W WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON A STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY UH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIOUS OF TIMES,WE TESTED WITH AM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY AH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR M VARIOUS OF TIMES
392,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO A EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND AM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE
393,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THAT THE WEIGT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS
394,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TWO I THINK THREE FOUR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LINE DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND UH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TWO I THINK THREE FOUR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LINE DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE
395,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU'VE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY SWINGS YOU GOT,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU HAVE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH END HOW MANY SWINGS YOU GOT
396,WELL I THINK THAT UM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IT TAKES UM MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH ONE CYCLE THAN UH THAN THE TWENTY TH THE MINE THE THIRTEEN INCH JUST HAS A FEW LIKE ONE TWO AND THAT WOULD BE A SWING,WELL I THINK THAT UM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IT TAKES A MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH ONE CYCLE THAN A THAN TTHE TWENTY THE MINE THE THIRTEEN INCH JUST HAS A FEW  ONE TWO AND THAT WOULD BE A SWING
397,WELL ONCE WE HUNG THEM ON THE BOARD WE GOT A KINDA PACKET THING WITH THE Y AXIS WITH THE Y AXIS AND THE X EX AXIS AND IT WAS JUST WAIT,WELL ONCE WE HUNG THEM ON THE BOARD WE GOT A KIND OF PACKET THING WITH THE WY XWITH THE WY AXS IN THE X XXES A AND IT WAS JUST WE
398,FIFTEEN SECONDS WELL NO BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAD MORE TIME I WOULD GET MORE AND THE LENGTH THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD GET MORE SO I GUESS THE TIMING DOES NOT MATTER YOU WOULD JUST LIKE MAYBE ADD ANOTHER TWENTY TWO OR ANOTHER FIVE SWINGS,FIFTEEN SECONDS WELL NO BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAD MORE TIME I WOULD GET MORE AND THE LENGTH THOUGH TWO HUNDRED AN FIFTEEN WOULD GET MORE SO I GUESS THE TIMING DOES NOT MATTER YOU WOULD JUST LIKE MEY BE AD ANOTHER TWENTY TWO OR ANOTHER FIVE SWINGS
399,WELL THE LONGEST ONE WE HAVE IS TWO FIFTEEN UH CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE ONLY WELL I SHOULD SAY THE VERY LONGER ONES OR EVEN THE LONG ONES DON'T GET AS MUCH AS THE SHORTER ONES,WELL THE LONGEST ONE WE HAVE IS TWO FIFTEEN A CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE ONLY W I SHOULD SAY THE VERY LONGER ONES OR EVEN THE LONG ONES DON'T GET AS MUCH AS THE SHORTER ONES
400,WELL LIKE I GUESS EVERYBODY MOVED AROUND THE ROOM AND WE BASICALLY UH LIKE EVERYBODY TIED IT TO THEIR DESK EXCEPT FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BUT SINCE I HAD UH THIRTEEN I TIED MY PENCIL TO THE DESK I PUT IT AROUND RIGHT HERE AND IT JUST KEPT ON SWINGING V UM A LOT MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS,WELL LIKE I GUESS EVERYBODY MOVED AROUND THE ROOM AND WE BASICALLY A LAK EVERYBODY TIED IT TO THEIR DESK EXCEPT FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BUT SINCE I HAD A THIRTEEN I TIED MY PENCIL TO THE DESK I PUT IT AROUND RIGHT HERE AND IT JUST KEPT ON SWINGING A A LOT MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
401,WELL LIKE OUR TEACHER SAYS WE CAN'T JUST LIKE IF THIS IS OUR SWINGER AND IT WENT LIKE THIS ONE ONE SWING WOULD BE ONE SO THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE THING,WELL LIKE OUR TEACHER SAYS WE CAN'T JUST LIKE IF THIS AS OUR SWINGER AND IT WOULD LIKE THIS ONE ONE SWING WOULD BE ONE SO THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE THING
402,WELL IT'S LIKE OF COURSE THE PERSON WHO HAD MORE TIME WOULD GET MORE SWINGS UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND WAIT IF UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY GET THE SAME,WELL IT'S LIKE OF COURSE THE PERSON WHO HAD MORE TIME WOULD GET MORE SWINGS UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND WAIT UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND FIFTEEN THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY GET THE SAFE
403,WELL WE H WE ATTACHED A PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AT THE END OF THE PENDULUM AND I UH WE PUT THE PENNY IN THERE AND AFTER WE DID IT AFTER A FEW TIMES UM WE ALL WANTED TO TRY IT WITH UH TWO MORE PENNIES AND WE UH SOME KIDS DID IT DOWN HERE SOME KIDS WENT UP HERE BUT IT STILL ENDED UP AS ELEVEN TWELVE OR MAYBE THIRTEEN,WELL WE WE ATTACHED A PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AT THE END OF THE PENDULUM AND I WE PUT THE PENNY IN THERE AND AFTER WE DID IT AFTER A FEW TIMES AM WE ALL WANTED TO TRY IT WITH A TWO MORE PENNIES AND WE A SOME KIDS DIDN'T DOWN HERE OR SOME KIDS W DID IT UP HERE BUT ITS STILL ENDERED UP AS ELEVEN TWELVE OR MAYBE THIRTEEN
404,THAT WELL THE TWO HUN AND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KINDA JUST GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING,THAT WELL THE TWO HUNDAND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KIN ES GOIN LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOIN
405,I GUESS IT IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TWO OR ONE TWO THREE FOUR THE THE WHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE,I GUESS IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TO OR WANT TO THREE FOUR THE THEWHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT ANY MORE
406,YEAH LIKE IF IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE WAIT IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I JUST DID ONE TWO UM THEN THE LONGER STRING WOULD MOST LIKELY GET UM THE MOST AMOUNT,YA LIKE IF IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE WAI IT'S LONGER CHAINGE THEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I JUST DID ONE TWO A THEN THE LONGER STRING WOULD MOST LIKELY GET UM THE MOST AMOUNT
407,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITLY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
408,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,OH WE HAD TO DO SORRY AM WE HAD TA SWE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AN OUR FIRST ONE WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY CLOSE TO THE KIND OF SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO BEN WENT ON
409,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,M WHEN YOU TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE AM I LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CANNON POLE FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WERE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE
410,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,YEL A LIKE WE KIND O DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL
411,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WYES WE WELL AH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED AT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CETMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY I MIGHT AM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT
412,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE UM OUR FOOPSTICK IS THE POPSCIL STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
413,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE YOU'LL GET AM MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS SO THEN YOU'LD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TOLF THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE
414,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,AM LIKE HAD IT WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICAL STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS E WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE AM ALLUMINUM FOIL AND WERE WE'RE KIND OF CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL AM ECAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AN THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY' SPUNTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLEAR DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IS AN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE AM HOW IREADDY SAI THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO AM AH
415,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND AM AM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED N FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING A KIND OF TAPE MEASURING TAPE
416,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND UM SO WE M OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR IT OUT IT IS NOT MATWY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CETING ITS AT A THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT
417,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALTOGETHER SO AM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN S WAS
418,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULT SO THAT'S HOW MYT HEE DECIDED HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND AM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR IT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LOKES AT THESE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DESIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR RESULT SO RECURN I MIXING MATH INTO THIS
419,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALLUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE AM I GUESS I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURO BID BY THIS AFTER YO
420,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK A SMALL ALLUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEATHE CORK WE PLACED IT O ALUMUM BOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSCALE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USED OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK
421,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOUR EACH INCH SO LIK FIR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS
422,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,SO LSO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AN THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT  WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEYOULD GO CLOSE TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE
423,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,AH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THEALUMINUMFUL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING CAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO TWAS
424,THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT UH THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT,ANDWHERE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALLUMINUM BAL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IODD THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT
425,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT
426,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND IN IN MORE AND MORE,IT'S LIKE AM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND HIN EN MORE AND MORE
427,THE SWIRLY THINGS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THE L BIG LINE AND THE SMALL LINE ARE IS THE BATTERY RIGHT HERE,THE SWIRLY THINGS ARE LIKE GLOBES AND THE BIG LINE AND THE SMALL LINE ARE IS THE BATTERY
428,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT HAS ONE TWO WIRES COMING OUT TWO WIRES COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM AND TWO COMING OUT OF THE TOP,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT HAS WHY ATO WATERS COMING OUT TWO WIRES COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM AND TWO COMING OUT OF THE TOP
429,IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T LIGHT,IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY TTHROUGH THE LIGHT BOLB THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHTBOL BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN THE LIGHTBOL WOULDN'T LIGHT
430,ONE OF THEM HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT ONE HAS ONE LIGHT BULB AND IT'S REALLY BRIGHT,ONE OF THEM HAS TWO LAPOLDS AND THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT ONE HAS ONE LIGHTBOLD AND IT'S REALLY BRIGHT
431,THE SWITCH THE SWITCH'S ROLE IS TO MAKE ELECTRICITY THRO FLOW THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNET AND TO MAKE THE WASHERS STICK TO THE RIVET,THE SWITCH THE SWITCH'S RULE IS TO MAKE ELECTRICITY THROAT FLOW THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNET AND TO MAKE THE WASHERS STICK TO THE RIVET
432,BECAUSE WHEN WE CLICKED ON SHOW FLOW THE LITTLE ELECTRICITY MAG THINGS FLEW THROUGH THE RIVET AND MADE THE MAGNET STICK,BECAUSE WHEN WE CLICKED ON SHOW FLOWED THE LITTLE ELECTRICITY AND THINGS FLEW THROUGH THE RIVET AND MADE THE MAGNET STICK
433,SOME T SOME MAGNETS STICK IN SOME WAYS SO IF YOU TURN THEM ON ONE SIDE THEY STICK IF YOU TURN THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY DON'T STICK,SOME SMAGNET STICK IN SOME WAYS SIF YOU TURNTHEM ON ONE SIDE THEY STICK AND IF YOU TURN EM ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY DON'T STICK
434,WHEN YOU WIND IT ONE HUNDRED TIMES IT H HOLDS FIFTEEN WASHERS WHEN YOU HOLD IT TEN TIMES IT'LL PROBABLY ONLY HOLD ABOUT ONE,WHEN YOU WIND IT ONE HUNDRED TIMES IT HOLDS FIFTEEN WASHERS WHEN YOU HOLD IT TEN TIMES IT'LL PROBABLY ONLY HOLD ABOUT ONE
435,THE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ONE WAY IS YOU LIST IT ONE THROUGH TEN ON THE X AXIS AND THE Y AXIS,THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ONE WAY IS YOU LIST IT ONE THROUGH TEN ON THE X AXIS AND THE WY AXIS
436,THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE THE MOTOR AND ITS MAKING THE MOTOR GOES THROUGH THE ITS MAKING MOTOR SPIN AND THEN OTHER ONE IS GOING THROUGH,THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING CONNECTING TO THE THE MOTOR N IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR GO THROUGH THE IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR SPINN AN AND OTHERWIRES GOING THROUGH THE
437,THE D CELL HAD BEEN ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE IT MAY CONTAIN D CELL,THE D SEL HAS ELECTRICITY IN THERE SO IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BOB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND BACK INTO THE DECEIL
438,ITS GIVING ENERGY THROUGH THE D CELL ACTUALLY LIKE ONE OF THEM GO AHEAD NEXT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE ACTIVITY CELL,IT SKIPPD H ENERGY THROUGH THE DETAIL UPTO THE IGH BOB THEN GUIRE NEXT TO THEI BOP AND THEM DACTIVTESO
439,THAT WHEN ONE BATTERY WILL ALLOW THE OTHER ONE WE NEED ONE IS OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS COME BACK IN WILL GIVE LATER AND LATER,THAT WHEN ANE'S BETTER HE RUNS OUT THE OTHER WILL WHEN IT RUNS OUT THE OTHER WILL COME BACK IN AND WI'LL GET LAGTER AND LATE
440,IT IS YOURSELF PROVIDES A BECAUSE SO THE WIRES IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE THE BATTERY IN THE INPUT ON TO THE LIGHT LATER,IDIOSIOL PERVIDES A PERGIT BECAUSE SO SO THE WIRES IF IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE THE BATTERY AND THEN PUT IT ONTO THE LIGHT I LIGHT U
441,IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE LEFT TO MAKE A LIGHT ON THE SIDE AND MAKE GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE,IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE WOLV TO MAKE IT LIGHT ON THE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BALL BACK INTO THE B
442,ITS BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND IS WHEN IT IS OF THE LIGHT BULB,IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WIN IT YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AN YOU TURN IT OFF THE LIGHT WON'T TURN
443,THE SERIES CIRCUIT WILL REPLACE THAT BECAUSE ITS TRAVELLING ENERGY FROM THE PLUS AND THEN WHEN YOU GET INTO THE MINUS WILL GO THROUGH THE PLUS AND BACK TO THE SWITCH AND THEN TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO THE MINUS,A SERIOUS CIRCIT WILL WORK LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S TRAVELLING ENERGY FROM THE PLUS AND THEN WHEN YOU GET IM THE MINUS HE'LL GO THROUGH THE PLUS AND BACK TO THE SWITCH AND THEN TO THE LIBOB AND THEN BACK TO THE MINU
444,ITS ITS ONCE SIDE THE PLUS ARE GOING TO AROUND INTO THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE MINUS,ITS ITS ONE SIDE THE PLUS ARE GOING AROUND AN TO THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE LIGHT BALV AND THEN INTO THE MINUS
445,IT'S THE FIRST ENERGY TO THE SECOND ENERGY TO THE THIRD ENERGY AND WHEN IT BREAKS IT WILL WHEN ALSO THAN WHEN THEY PUT INTO LIGHT BULB IN IT WILL GO BACK,IT'S THE FIRST ENERGY TO THE SECOND ENERGY TO THE THIRD ENERGY AND WHEN IT BREAKS IT WILL RUN OUT SO THEN WHEN THEY PUT A NEW LABOL IN IT WILL GO BACK
446,WHEN SOUTH AND NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL ATTRACT WHENEVER NORTH AND NORTH IT WILL REPEL SOUTH AND SOUTH WILL REPEL SOUTH AND NORTH WILL ATTRACT,WHEN SOUTH AND NOR NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL ATTRACT WHEN NORTHAN NORTH AND NORTH IT WILL REPEL SOUTH AND SOUTH WOL REVILLE SOUTH AND NORTH WILL ATTRACT
447,WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECTED TO THE BLOCK THEY WON'T ATTRACTS BECAUSE AS IRON INSIDE OF IT IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON INSIDE OF,WHEN YOU TRY TO CONDUCT IT TO THE BLOCK INT WON'T ATRACS POSSESS IRON INSIDE OF IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON INSTAD O
448,THIS NAIL WILL ATTRACT BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND AND THE RIVER ROCK WON'T ATTRACT WHERE THE BLOCK WON'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT,IS NEL WILL ATTRACT CAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND AND THE RIVER ROCK WON'T ATTRACT OR THE BLOCK WON'T ATRACT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN
449,IT'S IT'S MIDDLE AND INSIDE THE FRIDGE IS METAL TO AND METAL AND METAL OR IRON AND IRON WILL GO TOGETHER AND ATTRACT,IT'S ITS MIDDLE AND INSIDE THE FRIGE IS METAL TOO AND METAL AND METAL OR IRON AND IRON WILL GO TOGETHER AND IT WILL A TRA
450,I KNOW THAT UM CIRCUITS IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF THE LIGHT IN ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF,I KNOW THAT UM CIRCITS IS WHAT I KEEPS THE M LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF LIGHT NALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF
451,WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF,WELL PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
452,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON UNTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT PUP THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ONTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE
453,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BY TO OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEARE SHAPED DIFFERENT
454,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
455,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL ST,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE THE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BOL ALL THE OTHER ONES TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE STILL STA
456,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME AM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT
457,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BUL PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE
458,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK,AM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHTBULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK
459,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULP ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND  TO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY
460,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO FLOW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE,THIS ONE IS AM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE'S FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO THROW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE
461,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YES SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON
462,THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON,THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHERIS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OFF A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON
463,UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH,AM WHEN ONE BOA BOBS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH
464,WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH,WELL ON THE WIRE IS KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH
465,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THING'S THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THINGS T LIHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHTBOL
466,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AAS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT ER SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE
467,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS THE SAME UM AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS UM THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY
468,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB,MAYBE IT'S COMING FOM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB
469,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KINDA THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BOLB AND GO THROUGH THE KIND OF THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UN LIGHTS UP
470,WELL WHAT YOU DO WOULD YOU WRAP IT A KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THEN ANOTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOULD TURN ON,WELL WAT YOU DO WOULD YOU'D WRAP IT KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH NONE METAL PART AND THEN THEN HE OTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOU'D TURN ON
471,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE OF THE NOTCHES OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE OF THE KNOTCHES OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY
472,I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WAS IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T PUT IT ON THE UM BUTTON BUT UM IT IT WE IT'S GOING THROUGH A CERTAIN PARTS UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING IT GLOW COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING AROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN,I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WAS IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T FUT IT ON THE UN BUTTON BUT UM ITTIT'S GOING THROUGH A CERTAIN PART UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING IT GLOW  COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING ROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN
473,WELL HERE NO BECAUSE THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULB IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME,WILL HEARE NO BECAUSE THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULB IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME
474,THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR WOULD SORT OF BE LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN,HE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU ARE DRIVING A COGH SORT OF BE LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN
475,UM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT,AM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS ON THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON AND WOAD'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT
476,AT THE UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM,ATUM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS HER SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM
477,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
478,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KINDA THING AND YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE U'M LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KIND OF THING AND YOU'D HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO
479,THEY ARE I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THOUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE V FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH,THER ARE AINBOOT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THROUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY IT COME THROUGH
480,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BOL WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE DESEL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NUT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT
481,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM WHITE BULB
482,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LHITE BULB TILL IT STARTS GOING AND THEN WHEN ITS GLOWING MORE ELECTRIS TRICIT FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINO SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT
483,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUSID AN MINUSIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED UP
484,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURE
485,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE IN
486,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS AN VERY IMPORTANT ROLLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
487,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,AM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT AM THE SALT LAKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
488,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
489,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILE WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
490,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMIMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER ITIS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
491,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT M ITS PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING TSE AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND OM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STUFF AND THAT IND YE
492,UH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK,AH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRREL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK
493,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES AM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER
494,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS ONE ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
495,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,SO THE SALAD HAS MANY THINGS MIXED INTO IT OM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES
496,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER INSTUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN AM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN
497,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAL MIK SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
498,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF ILLUSION BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT
499,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
500,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY FULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE FANTASTIC,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VARIPBLE IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE TASTIC
501,WELL TODAY WE USED UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CAN'T,WELL TO DAY WE USED A WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN
502,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UM PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LES UM ORANG PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE
503,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A CUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE
504,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LESS IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS A DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH GLASS HAS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MAX
505,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNI FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAN ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WON'T,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNY FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU COULD ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WUNT D
506,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUBE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUBE
507,ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM,ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN TH
508,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A THINGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD UM YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A LITTLE THANGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD A YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCOCHELA JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE
509,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATWATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GREAT MIX ONE HHAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS BLESS PURPLE
510,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SORRY WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SERWHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THTHAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR
511,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
512,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLIMETERS OF WATER BUT WITH THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE
513,YOU COULD TELL HOW CONCENTRATED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER,YOU CAN TELL HOW COMPTED THTRAINTED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINKS MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LAS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER
514,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT NIGHT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHD A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
515,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS,I THINK THE ONE WITH TANY GRAMPS OF SALUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SALUTE A THE OTHER ONE HAS LES
516,THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT,THANKS MARTY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT
517,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES
518,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT YOU COULD LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A  YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS
519,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER
520,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTALS,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT AM IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IT'S MPD WITH NOTHING BUT SAULT CRYSTAL
521,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU POUR TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS
522,HERE THE FLOUR IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ONTO THE BOTTOM AND AND THE REST OF THE FLOUR STAYS ON THE TOP IN THE COFFEE FILTER,HERE THE FLOWER IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER AM THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ON TO THE BOTTOM AND THE AND THE REST OF THE FLOWER STAYS IN THE TOP IN THE COFFEE BILTER
523,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,WHAT'S HAPPEN IN THIS PICTURE MARNY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEYHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAM
524,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
525,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE ON A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT
526,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE,I THINK WITH SAULT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTURE DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE
527,SURE MARNEY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS,SURE MERNY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH TO DAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKD ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS
528,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE AND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL,SIS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THANG AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE WAIN THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL A WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FORALL
529,I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION,I NOTICE THAT THE CICCYTRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL OF IT GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION

717,THEY CAN NOT BE THE SAME BECAUSE THE HERBIVORES EAT GRASS AND THE CARNIVORES EAT MEAT SO THEY COULDN'T BE THE SAME CAUSE THEY WOULDN'T EAT THE GRASS AND THE OTHER ANIMALS WOULD NOT EAT THE MEAT THE OMNIVORES WOULD EAT THE BERRIES AND MEAT SO THEY COULD BE LIKE THE HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES DETRIVORES EAT THINGS LIKE THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS THEY EAT THE DEAD ANIMALS SO THEY ARE ALIKE TO EVERYTHING,THEY CANNOT BE THE SAME BECAUSE THE HERBOVORS EAT GRASS AND THE CARNIVORS EAT MEAT SO THEY COULDN'T BE THE SAME CAUSE THEY WOULDN'T EAT THE GRASS AND THE OTHER ANIMALS WOULD NOT EAT THE MEAT THE OMNIVORS WOULD EAT THE BERRIES AND MEAT SO THEY COULD BE ALIKE TO THE CARNIVORS AND HERBAVORS DETRAVORS EAT THINGS LIKE DTHEY ARE DECOMPOSERS THEY EAT THE DEAD ANIMALS SO THEY ARE ALIKE TO EVERYTHING
718,THESE RED WORMS ARE INTO ROTTING LEAVES AND OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A LITTLE BIT OF SOIL THEY'VE TURNED IT INTO SOIL AS THEY CONSUMED IT AND USED IN THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS,THESE REDWORMS ARE CHANGED INTO LEAV ROTTING LEAVES AND OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A LITTLE BIT OF SOIL THEY'VE TURNED IT INTO RICHENED SOIL AS THEY CONSUMED IT AND USED AND THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS
719,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE IT IS SOIL THAT THEY CAN USE FOR PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO GROW AGAIN AND RESTART THE FOOD CHAIN ARE YOU GONNA TALK GEE OH,IT RELATES TO THE EMVIRAMENT CAUSE IT IS RITEN RICH IN SOIL THAT THEY CAN USE FOR PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO GROW AGAIN AND RESTART THE FOOD CHAIN OT IARE GONG O TALK TOY
720,THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN A FOOD WEB BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT,THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN A FOOD WEB BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
721,AN OMNIVORE IS ALIKE TO HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES IT GETS ITS FOOD FROM MEAT AND PLANTS JUST LIKE THE CARNIVORES IT EATS MEAT JUST LIKE THE HERBIVORES IT EATS PLANTS IT'S OFF IS IT COME ON WHAT THE,AN OMNIVOR IS LIKE TO HERB OVORS AND CARNIVORS IT GETS ITS FOOD FROM MEAT AND PLANTS JUST LIKE THE CARNIVARS IT EATS MEAT JUST LIKE THE HERBEVORS IT EATS PLANTS S OFF IS IT COMEON WHAT O ER
722,A DECOMPOSERS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT THE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN OMNIVORE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT'LL ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ANIMALS I WOULD CONSIDER IT A CARNIVORE,A DECOMPOSER IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT THE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED NOMINABOR EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT WILL EAT ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ANIMALS I WOULD CONSIDER IT A CARNIVAL
723,BEING A PRODUCER IS PROVIDING FOOD FOR OTHER ANIMALS BEING A PRODUCER IS TAKING THE SUNLIGHT FROM IS TAKING LIGHT ATTACHING IT TO ITSELF AND FEEDING ITSELF AND THEN THE ENERGY GOES TO THE CONSUMERS AND THE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY AND THEN THE DECOMPOSERS ONCE THE CONSUMERS DIE EVEN THE DECOMPOSERS GET THE SUNS ENERGY,BEING A PRODUCER IS PROVIDING FOOD FOR OTHER ANIMALS BEING A PRODUCER IS TAKING THE SUNLIGHT FROM IS TAKING LIGHT ATTACHING IT TO ITSELF AND FEEDING ITSELF AND THEN THE ENERGY GOES TO THE CONSUMERS AND THE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY AND THEN THE DECOMPOSERS WANCS THE CONSUMERS DIE EVEN THE DECOMPOSERS GET THE SUN'S ENERGY
724,DECOMPOSERS WOULD EAT THE DEAD SOIL AND THE SOIL INSIDE OF A DEAD PLANT MUSHROOMS WOULD ALSO DO THAT BUT THEY WOULD GROW ON TOP OF IT AND START USING IT FOR FUEL WORMS WOULD ATTACK IT SORT OF LIKE A CARNIVORE,DECOMPOSERS WOULD EAT THE DEAD SOIL AND THE SOIL INSIDE OF A DEAD PLANT MUSHROOMS WOULD ALSO DO THAT BUT THEY WOULD GROW ON TOP OF IT AND START USING IT FOR FUEL WORMS WOULD ATTACK IT SORT OF LIKE A CARNIVAL
725,A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE A CONSUMER OR ANYTHING THAT EATS PLANTS EATS PRODUCERS AND THEN THE PRODUCERS GET THEY ARE CALLED PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THE FOOD FOR THE FIRST LEVEL CONSUMERS,A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE A CONSUMER OR ANYTHING THAT EATS PLANTS EATS THE PRODUCERS AND THEN THE PRODUCERS GET THEY ARE CALLED PRODUCERS CAUSE THEY PRODUCE THE FOOD FOR THE FIRST LEVEL CONOSUMERS
726,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK BASICALLY BUT I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT AND THEY ARE SORT OF EQUAL TO WHAT WE ARE LEARNING,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK BASICALLY BUT UM IHAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT AND THEY ARE SORT OF EQUAL HARPER TO WHAT WE ARE LEARN
727,THIS IS A FOOD WEB THE DEER WOULD HARM THE RABBIT AND THE RABBIT WOULD EAT THE GRASS THE LION WOULD HARM THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE POLAR BEAR WOULD GO TO THE LION THE BEAR EATS WOULD GO TO THE MEAT AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE BEAR AND THEN THE BEAR WOULD GO TO THE HUNTER AND SOIL WOULD GO TO A MUSHROOM AND THEN THE AND THEN THE MUSHROOM WOULD GO TO THE WORM,THIS IS A FOOD WEB THE DEER WOULD HARM THE RABBIT AND THE RABBIT WOULD EAT THE GRASS THE LION WOULD HARM THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE MEAT WTHE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE POLAR BEAR WOULD GO TO THE LION THE BERRIES WOULD GO TO THE MEAT AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE BEAR AND THEN THE BEAR WOULD GO TO THE HUNTER AND THE SOIL WOULD GO TO A MUSHROOM AND THEN THE AND THEN THE MUSHROOM WOULD GO TO THE WORM
728,DECOMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM BECAUSE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS AND THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM THE DEAD CONSUMERS AND THEY GET,DECOMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM BECAUSE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS AND THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM THE DEAD CONSUMERS AND THEY GET
729,A CONSUMER IS SOMETHING THAT CONSUME PRODUCERS WHAT THAT WOULD CONSUME CONSUME PRODUCERS PRODUCERS ARE THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS,A CONSUMER IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD CONSUME PRODUCERS WAT TAT WOULD CONSUME CTHAT WOUD PCONSUME PRODUCERS PRODUCERS ARE THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCER
730,FIRST OF ALL FIRST OF ALL I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ANATOMY SECOND OF ALL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT ANATOMY IS THIRD OF ALL YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE SO SMART YOU'RE NOT SMART,FIRST OF ALL  AN FIRST OF ALL I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ANATIMY SECOND OF ALL I DON'T KNOW WHETHE MO ANATOMY IS THIRD OF ALL YOU ACT LIKE YOURSELF LINE YET ASWAT
731,I SEE LUNGS I SEE BRONCHIOLES I SEE TRACHEA I SEE BRONCHIS I SEE THE MOUTH AND I SEE THE NOSE BABOOM YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALIVE AND YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE SO SMART THAT'S RIGHT RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS,I SEE THELONGS I SEE BRONKILS I SEE CHAKIER I SEE BONK EYES I SEE THE MOUTH AND I SEE THE NOSE BOO YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALIVE AND YOU ACKT LICKE THIS LITTLE MARK THAT'S RIGHT VE YAR BATH
732,I THINK THE LUNGS ARE PROVIDE THE BODY WITH AIR CARBON DONOXIDE AND OXYGEN OR O TWO AND C O TWO,I THINK THE LUNGS A PROVIDE THE BODY WITH AIR CARBON NOXIDE AND OXYGEN OR O TU AND SO TWO
733,I THINK THAT THE LUNGS PROVIDE AIR TO ALL THE CELLS IN OUR BODY AND GET RID OF C O TWO,I THINK THA THUNS PROVIDE AIR TO ALL U SELVS IN OUR BODY AND GET RAO SE OUT TOO
734,IT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING AND HOW LUNGS WORK I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AIR'S COMING FROM AND I BET THAT GUY'S A MEXICAN,I TALK ABOUT BREATHING AND HOW THE LUNGS WORK BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AIR'S COMING FROM A BUT THA ISMIXTK
735,IF IT IS SOIL THEN OH WOW YES THEY DO NEED SPACE OR ROOM TO GROW BUT THEY DO NOT NEED IT A FULL,IF IT IS SOIL THEN OH WELL YES THEY DO NEED SPACE OR ROOM TO GROW BUT THEY DO NOT NEED A FULL R
736,IT IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE STUDYING ABOUT PLANTS AND ALSO WE GROW WHEAT AND THAT ONE GROWS IN THE DARK THE ONE WITH THE DARKER COLORS,IT IS UMRELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE STUDYING ABOUT PLANTS AND ALSO WE GREW WHEAT AND THAT ONE WAS IN THE DARK THE ONE WITH THE DARKER COLOR
737,IT IS BUILT UP OF MANY GRAVITY PULLS AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE EARTH THE EARTH,IT IS BUILT UP OF MANY GRAVITA POLES AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE EARTH ARS
738,THEY ALL HAVE SOMETHING LIVING INSIDE THEM EXCEPT FOR THE SUITCASE OKAY MAYBE IT HAS A CAT INSIDE OF IT THE T V HAS YEAH,THEY ALL HAVE SOMETHING LIVING INSIDE THEM EXCEPT FOR THE SUIT CASE OCAY MAYBE IT HAS A CAT INSIDE OF IT THE T V HAS YE
739,THE ENGINE THE ENGINE IS USED FOR UM FOR LIKE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES BUT THEY ALL JUST WORK TOGETHER THE WHEELS ARE POWERED BY THE AXLE AND STUFF AND YOU KNOW,THE ENGINE THE ENGINE IS USED FOR UM FOR LIKE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES BUT THEY 'LL JUST WORK TOGETHER THE WHEELS ARE POWERED BY THE AXLAN STUPAND Y
740,THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT PARTS BY THE WAY WHY DO YOU JUST THE LIGHT GREEN WHAT IS IT IS IT JUST NORMAL IS IT YOU JUST TRYING TO TRICK PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME LISTEN TO ME,THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT PARTS BUTBY THE WAY WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US THE LIGHT GREEN WHAT IS IT IS THE DEATH NORMAL IS IT YOU JUST TRYING TO TRICK PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME LISTEN TO ME
741,IT IS A SYSTEM GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT EARTH,IT IS A SYSTEM GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT EARTH
742,BIOSPHERES ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE BIOSPHERE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR,BYOSPHERES ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE BIOSPHERE CAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR
743,PEOPLE ANIMALS TRY TO EAT THEM AND WHEN THEY EAT BACTERIA IT GETS INTO HERBIVORE AND IT HAS A POISON GET,PEOPLE ANIMALS SHOULD EAT THEM AND WHEN THEY EAT BACTERIA IT GETS INTONAN HOR AND I HAS A POISON SGET P
744,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE CAUSE WHEN THEY HAVE IN THE DIRT THEY ARE EATING THROUGH IT AND NATURE BUT IN THIS CASE THEY'RE IN A BALL AND THEY'RE EATING THE DEAD THE SCRAP,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE CASE WHEN THEY HAVE SOIPLE IN THE DIRT THEY ARE EATING TROUGIT IN NATURE BUT IN THIS CASE THEY'RE IN A BOTTLE AND THEYI'RE EATING THE DEAD THE SCRAP
745,I NOTICED THAT UM SOME THINGS IT WOULD SOAK THROUGH AND SOME THINGS IT SHOULD JUST SAY THE SAME AND THEN LOOK LIKE A WATER CROP,I NOTICED THAT ON SOME THINGS IT WOULD SOAK THROUGH IN SOMETHING DID SHE JUST SAY THE SAME AND LOOK LIKE A WATER DROP
746,ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT DID THE SAME THING IT EXPLODED BUT THEN IT JUST TURNED INTO A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER AND SOAKED THROUGH SO IT KINDA JUST FAILED,ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT DID THE SAME THING AN EXPLODED BUT THEN IT JUST TURNED INTO A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER AND SOAKED THROUGH SO IT KIND OF JUST FAILED
747,YEAH IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE S IT AS ON THE SOAPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS,IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE AS ON THE SOAPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS
748,WELL ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT'S STAYING FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF,WELL ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT STANED FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF
749,THAT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MICROSCOPE IT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER ONCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY,THAT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN IT'S GOIN DOWN IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND THEN IT S KIND O LIKE A MICROSCOPE IT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER ONCE YOU GET ALL THE WET
750,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN WE'RE WE WERE SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER AND SALT WATER ON THE PENNY,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN U WERE SEING WHAT HAPPENED IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER IN SALT WATER ON THE PENNY
751,OH UM WELL WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF ONCE YOU G PUT A LOT ON IT WILL START COMING OFF Y OR ELSE IT'LL START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP,OH UM WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF ONCE YOU PUT A LOT ON IT'LL START COMING OFF OR I'LL START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP
752,HAVE N WELL CAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER,HAVNWELL CAUSE THEY CONNEXT TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER
753,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFACE IT'S ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IS IT IS ON ON SOME SURFACES IT'LL JUST EXPLODE AND YEAH,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFACE ITS ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IIT IS ON ON SOME SURFACES IT'LL JUST EXPLODE AN YE
754,ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S HITS AND IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT TAKES OUT SOME OF THE WATER,ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HITS AND IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT  MAKES IT SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT TAKES OUT SOME OF THE WATER
755,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF,I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DUMB KIND OF
756,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ASORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO N IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH,IT IS TOLLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ABORB SOAP CTAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO IT TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH
757,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
758,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OH WHAT WAS I GONNA CALL IT UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBLY O WHAT WAS A CALLED UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET
759,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED AND WITH THE MAGNETS FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL,CAUSE WE WE LEARNED WITH THE MAGNETS THAT FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL
760,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACES THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT'D BE PRETTY BAD,YOU COULD JUS USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACETHINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THAN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT E PRETTY BAD
761,UM CAUSE IT WOULD JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY LIKE GET LESS AND LESS AND LESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES MMM HMM,UM BECAUSE TEY'D JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY ID GET LESS AND LESS ANALIS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES
762,UM OH LETS SEE THE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE HAVE NO CLUE YEAH ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS,O LET'S SEE MORE TIGHTLY DID I THINK THE MORE I'VE NO CLUE YE ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS
763,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING,OCAY UM SO TO DAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTRO MAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING
764,WELL ELECTROMAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP SINCE THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM,O ELECTRO MAGNET IS JUST METAL AND TE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SUBSTANCE THEY WERE BUT THEY'RE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF EL THAT'S WHAT I CALLM
765,TO TEST THE MORE WRAPS OH YEAH LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN WRAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN WRAPS MY GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN AND THEN FOR FIFTY WRAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS MMM HMM,TOTEST THE MORE RAPS OH YA LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN RAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN RAPS MIT GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN THEN FOR FIFTY RAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS UUM
766,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNET YOU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MMM HMM UH HUH,WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH THE MAGNETE YOU WOULD JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU'D HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR HA
767,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETISM WELL THE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IT CAN AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET,THOUGH I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WORLD WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT M TE OTHAT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNT AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETTHE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IAS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO ID BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET
768,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP WELL PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL AM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP  PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM
769,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S ALL WELL IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICIS AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAG WELL I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT YEAH,THE RIVER IT'S UM IT'S ABOLT SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRISES AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAGBO I'D SAY WASHERS AHA SO A YE
770,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVE IT MORE ENERGY ES CAUSE IT'S CLOSER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT'D BE UH HUH,UM ET SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY CAUSE IT'S CLOSER DOES IT HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE RAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTRO MAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE I'D E
771,YEAH BEFORE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PICK ANYTHING UP,A BEFORE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END IN A WOODEN POKE ANYTHING UP
772,WE TRIED TO SEE DID IT MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE H HOW DOES IT DO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE,WE TRIED TO SEE DIDN'T MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE HODOES IT IMATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE
773,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY MMM HMM,LWE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE THE ELECTRIELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY
774,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD'VE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAG UM WELL A ELECTRICITY SO UM,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD HAVE EITHE EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAUMMOELECTRICITY SO UM
775,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIPE ULP TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
776,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IS NOT LIGHTING UP
777,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A M NOT MAG A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT UP,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON AMNOT MA A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRIED TO MAKE A LIGHTBOL UM LIGHT UP
778,UM SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS,SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS
779,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE
780,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCKED MY FINGER,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I TOUCHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCK MY FINGER
781,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THTHE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT
782,THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT F IF WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE AND POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM,THE LIGHT BOB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE AND POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM
783,CELLS ARE NINE NINE ARE NINE VOLT BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB M LIGHT UP,SELLS AR NINNO AR NINE BOALT BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE A LIGHT BUB LIGHT UP
784,THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF,THE BALB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
785,THE GREEN AREAS BY OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE UM D CELL AND ON ONE SIDE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S THAT ONE UM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT'S SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND KNOW WHICH ONE WHICH SIDE SWITCHED,E GREEN AREAS CLOSE OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE UM DECAL AND ON ONE SIDE ON THEPOSITIVE SIDE THERE'S THAT ONE UM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND NO A CWHICH I DWITCHED
786,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE UM,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE
787,IT LETS THE WIRES GET ENERGY SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE LIGHT IT CAN UM LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES,IT LETS THE WIRES GET ENERGY SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE LIGHT IT CAN UM LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES
788,THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WIRES IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE D CELL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE IT WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE,ITHERE ISN'T A PATHWAY FHROUGH THE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHT BALL ISN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WIRERS IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE D CEL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE IT WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE
789,WELL THE BATTERY'S A D CELL AND IT HAS POG POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE LIGHT BULB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIRE,WELL THE BATTERY'S A DCEL AND IT HAS POCKET POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE LIGHT BOLB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIRE
790,THE CONDUCTING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM AND TO THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES IT LIGHTS UP,HE CONDUCTING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM AND TO THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES IT LIGHTS UP
791,IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST CIRCUIT THOUGH THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL COMING BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT,IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST CIRCIT THOUGH THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL COMING BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT
792,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO UM THEY'RE TRYING TO UM GET ATTRACTED AND YOU CAN MOVE THE BOTTOM ONE THE TOP ONE WILL MOVE TOO,WELL THE TWO MAGNANTS ARE TRYING TO UM THEY'RE TRYING TO UM GET ATTRACTED AND YOU CAN MOVE THE BOTTOM ONE THE TOP ONE'LL MOVE TO
793,AND ON THE THICK AND ON THE THICK PIECE OF ON THE THICK STACK IT IT CANNOT ATTACH TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GET TO THE TOP,AND ON THE THICK UN ON THE THICK PIECE O ON THE THICK STACK IT IT CANNOT ATTACH TO THE MAGNIM BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GET TO THE TOP
794,THE MAGNET IN THE MAGNET IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE PAPERCLIP THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GO THROUGH ALL THE PIECES OF PAPER TO TRY TO GET THE TO TRY TO GET THE PAPERCLIP,THE MAGNET INTHE MAGNET IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE PAPER CLIP THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GO THROUGH ALL THE PIECES OF PAPER TO TRY TO GET THEM TO TRY TO GET THE PAPER CLIP
795,WHEN YOU DROPPED THE MAGNET AND IT WENT UNDER THE TABLE YOU MOVED THE TOP YOU MOVED THE BOTTOM MAGNET S AND IT AND IT MOVED THE TOP MAGNET AROUND THE TABLE,WHEN YOU DROPPED THE MAGNET AND IT WENT UNDER THE TABLE YOU MOSED THE TOP YOU MOVED THE BOTTOM MAGNET AN IT AN IT MOVE THE TOP MAGNET AROUND THE TABLE
796,THE THICK STACK IS TOO THICK FOR THE MAGNET TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERCLIP AND THE THIN STACK IS ABLE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT CAN GO THROUGH,THE THICK STACK IS TOO THICK FOR THE MAGNAT TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AND THE THIN STACK IS ABLE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT CAN GO THROUGH
797,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS REPEL EACH BECAUSE ONE HAS UM ONE SIDE OF THE MAGNET THAT DOESN'T WANT TO STICK TO THE OTHER SO IT'S CALLED REPELLING,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS REPEL EACH OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS OM ONE SIDE OF THE MAGNET THAT DOESN'T WANT TO STICK TO THE OTHER SO IT'S CALLED REPELLING
798,ONE S ONE UM STACK OF PAPER HAS IS TOO THICK SO THAT THE MAGNET FORCE CANNOT PICK UP CANNOT KEEP THE PAPERCLIP ON AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THIN SO THAT IT CAN KEEP THE PAPERCLIP ON,ON ONE UMSTOCK OF PAPER HAS IS TOO THICK SO THAT THE MAGNET FORCE CANNOT PICK CANNO KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THIN SO THAT IT CAN KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON
799,THE PAPER IS SO THIN THAT THE MAGNET THE MAGNET FORCE CAN TOUCH THE UM TOUCH THE UM PAPERCLIP SO IT CAN MOVE AROUND,THEPAPER IS SO THIN THAT THE MAGNET THE MAGNET FORCE CAN TOUCH THE ARM TOUCH THEON PAPER CLIP SO IT CAN MOVE AROUND
800,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED AND WHEN Y WHEN YOU DROP THE FIRST ONE AND IT WENT UNDER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE IT'S BECAUSE THAT THE FIRST MAGNET THAT WAS ON THE TABLE ORIGINALLY HAD A REALLY HIGH MAGNET MAGNETISM FORCE SO WHEN IT CAME DOWN IT WOULD ATTACK IT WOULD ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNET,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED AND WHEN WHEN YOU DROPPED THE FIRST ONE IN IT WENT UNDERTO THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE IT'S BECAUSE THAT THE FIRST MAGNET THAT WAS ON THE TABLE ORIGINALLY HAD A REALLY HIGH MAGNET MAGNETISM FOR SO WHEN IT CAME DOWN IT WOULD ATTAK IT WOULD ATTRACT THE OTHER MAGNET
801,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS WE OBSERVED WITH TWO MAGNETS ON TABLE ON A TABLE LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU SHOWED SO WE WE COU WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THE BOTTOM SO THAT'S HOW I KNOW THE QUESTION,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS WE OBSERVED WITH TWO MAGNETS ON TABLE ON A TABLE LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU SHOWED SO WE COULD WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THE BOTTOM SO THAT'S I KNOW THE QUESTION
802,T THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PUSHING IS TRYING TO GET THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT TOGETHER TO UM TO MOVE,THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PUSHING IS TRYING TO GET THE OTHER MAGNET BBECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT TOGETHER TO UM TO MOVE
803,MAGNETISM IS ABOUT WHEN M YOU HAVE A MAGNET AND YOU CAN PUT IT ON A NAIL AND THE MAGNET FORCE CAN GO THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICK UP A PAPERCLIP,MAGNETISM IS ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE A MAGNET AND YOU CAN PUT IT ON A NAIL AND THE MAGNET FORCE CAN GO THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICK UP A PAPER CLOP
804,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE THE THE TABLE HA ISN'T SO THICK SO THAT THE TWO MAGNETS CAN ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT TOGETHER,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE THE THE TABLE ISN'T SO THICK SO THAT THE TWO MAGNETS CAN ARE ABLE TO ATTTRACT TOGETHER
805,BECAUSE A WIRE IS LIKE A CONDUCER BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON LIKE A NAIL OR PAPER CLIP SO THAT IT CAN CONDUCT ELECTRICITY,BECAUSE A WIRE IS LIKEK A CONDUCER BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON LIKE A NAIL OR PAPER CLIP SO THAT IT CAN CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
806,WHEN THE STRAW IS TRYING TO DID WHAT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT'S STILL OPEN,WHEN THE STRAW IS TRYING TO DO WHAT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSE CIRCUIT IT'S STILL OPEN
807,WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK,WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF HEU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
808,IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH AND IT'S CLOSED AND YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR AND ATTACH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH THE SWITCH WILL START UM THE SWITCH WILL START WORKING AND THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB WILL GO ON,IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN ITS CLOSE AND YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR AND ATTACH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH THE SWITCH WILL START UM THE SWITCH WILL START WORKING AND THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BALL WILL GO ON
809,A NAIL CAN MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE L SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTOR S,A NAIL COULD MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTORS
810,WHEN THE NAIL TOUCHES THE CONDUCTOR WELL WHEN THE NAIL IS THE CONDUCTOR AND IT TOUCHES THE SWITCH IN THE END OF THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND,WHEN THE NAIL TOUCHES THE CONDUCTOR WILL WHEN THE NAIL SIS THE CONDUCTOR AND IT TOUCHES THE SWITCH IN THE END OF THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND
811,I THINK WE HAVE PARALLELS BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE IT ISN'T AS DIM AS WELL IT'S NOT AS DIM AS ONE CIRCUIT BUT IT'S AS IT'S LIGHTER THAN THAT CIRCUIT BUT IT'S THE SAME CIRCUIT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS,I THINK WE HAVE PARALLELS BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE IT ISN'T AS DIM AS WELL IT'S NOT AS DIM AS ONE CIRCIT BUT IT OS IT'S LIGHTER THAN THAT CIRCIT BUT ITS THE SAME CIRCUIT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS
812,IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONES THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL,IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS IN ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONES THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIGHT BOLBS IN ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL
813,GOES BACK IN THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,OES BACK IN THE DECAIL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
814,WELL THAT THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB REPRESENTS THE TWO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IT'S IN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT UM AND HOW IT WORKS,WELL THAT THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BALB REPRESENTS THE THE WHITE BALB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IS S IN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCREMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT UM AND HOW IT WORKS
815,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUT ITS A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
816,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN UM A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THROW F FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN UM A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THRO FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WHERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES
817,WELL SINCE OUR LIGHT ARE STILL LIT UP LIKE IN OUR DOWNSTAIRS THEY ARE REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IN ONE ROOM IT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY STARTS IN OUR HOUSE AND LIGHTS IT UP A LOT BRIGHT BRIGHTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE,WELL SINCE OUR LIGHTS ARE SO LIT UP LIKE IN OR DOWNSTAIRS THEY ARE REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IN ONE ROOM IT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY STARTS IN OUR HOUSE AND LIGHTS IT UP A LABRIT BRIGHTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
818,THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULBS AND ETC ETC,THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BOLB AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE DESAIL LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BOBS AND ET CETERA ET CETERA
819,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT,THE PARALLEL CIRCUT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP FARTHER THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THAT THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT
820,IT IS GOING THROUGH ONE END OF THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING BULBS UP AGAIN AND THEN GOING AND THEN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,IT IS GOING THROUGH ONE END OF THE DECELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE DECEL FINDING BULBS UP AGAIN AND THEN GONIN TAN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
821,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE D CELL FLOW THROUGH THROW THROUGH ONE HI ONE LIGHT BULB LIGHTED UP AND THEN COME BACK TO THE D CELL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND COME BACK TO THE D CELL,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE DSEL FLOW THROUGH THROAT THROUGH ONE HIT ONE LIHT BULB BLIGHT IT UP AND THEN COME BACK TO THE DECEL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND COME BACK TO THE J CELL
822,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL COMING OUT OF THE OTHER END LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST GOING THROUGH A THIN A THIN WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB THEN GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL AND REPEATING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE DECELL COMING OUT THE OTHER END LIGHTING OUT THE LIGHT BALB WHICH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST THROWING THROUGH A A THIN WIRE IN THE LIGHT BULB THEN GOING BACK THROUGH THE DECELL AND REPEATING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN
823,THE D CELL IS LETTING ENERGY THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY,THE DECEL IS LETTING ENERGY THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BULBS LIGHD UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY
824,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT THAN THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH WHITE BALL SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT RATHER THAN THIS ITS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS
825,M WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL CAUSE UM SINCE THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WIDTH ER THEY'RE ALL WIDER,WEL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT IN AMOUNTS IS ECAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL CAUS I SINCE AT ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GING O TTHER THEYRE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFERFRENT AND THEY ELEVATED FRM WITH THEY'RE ALL WIDER
826,WELL WIDENESS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE AND A CIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHER'S JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S WIDER HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FOURTH GRADE THAT IF YOU S IF THAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'LL FLOAT SO WITH THE BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH THE WIDER BOAT CUP BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOAT BETTER AND HOLD MORE PASSENGERS,WE WINESS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE IN A  CCIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHERS JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHETHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S TS WIDE AND HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT AM WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FOURTH GRADE THAT IF YOU IF TAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'LL FLOAT SO  WITH THA BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH A WIDER BOA CUP SOFIS MO MORE BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOT BETTER AN WHON WERE PASSENGERSES
827,L FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO SPREAD 'EM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK 'EM TO ALL ONE SIDE ELSE YOU WON'T GET THE ANSWER YOU NEED TO KIND OF SPREAD 'EM EVENLY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS UM MY PARTNER WE HAD THE SAME BOAT THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE HE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURED OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN 'EM OUT,WELL FIRSTOF ALL YOU NED TO SPREAD HIM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK EM ALL TO ONE SIDE ELSE YOU WON'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER YOU NEED TO KIND OF SPREAD HIM EVILY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS A MY PARTNER WE HATD THE SAME BOAU THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE HE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURED I WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN EM OUT
828,WELL I'D WELL I'D WELL FIRST I'D LIKE PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNIES IN THEN YOU WANT TO PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YEAH CAUSE YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK CAUSE IF IF EIGHT WITH EIGHT PENNIES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL UM IF THEY IF EIGHT PENNIES SINKS IT THEN THE RESULTS WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES,WEL I'D WELL I'D WELL FIRST I'D LIKE PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNIES IN THEN YOU WANT PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BAND THEN YOU YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK AND THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YA BECAUSE YOUDON'T CET THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK CCASE IF IF EIGHT IWITH EIGHT PENNIES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL OM I IF EIGHTPENNYES SINKS IT THEN THE RESULT WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES
829,WELL UM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PENNIES LIKE ALL TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD KIND OF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU EVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST STAY EVEN AND AND AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER,WWELL IM IF YOU LIKE  PUT THE PIP PENNIES LIKE ALL TO  ONE SIDE IT WILD KIND O START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF HE EAVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST TAY EVEFENT AN AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER
830,UM I THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAT IT MIGHT SO THAT ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE,OM I'VE WELL I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YEU GOT EM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND N EVEN IF THEY ARE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAI MIGHT SO THE OTHE ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE
831,UM WELL THERE ONE H ONE UM CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER S SIDE THERE'S T TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S STARTING TO TIP THAT WAY AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GONNA TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK,AM WELL THERE ONE PONE UM CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD  THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE'S TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S ARINT TO TIP THAT WAY AND AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GOING TO TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK
832,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HEIGHTS AND ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY WANNA TEST WHICH ONE WILL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATER,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HEIGHT AND ITLOOKS LIKE THEY WANT A TES WHIHONE WE'LL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATERTER
833,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WHOEVER'S TRYING TO TEST IS SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECA SEEING UM IF A SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AND YEAH,AM IT LOOKS LIKE THR WHOEVER IS TRYING TO TEST I SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECSEEING EM IF THE SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AN YE
834,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A LIKE A KIND OF WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT COULD FILL WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE'S A TON OF WAVES AND IT DID SEE IT TI IT SWIVELS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST STAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST STAY FLAT IF IT THE WATER'S CALM IT WORKS BETTER,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE LIKE A TUN O WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT COULD FILL WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE 'S A TON OF WAVES AND IT DID IIT SWIVELES FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST SAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST STAY FLAT AN IF THE WATERS CALM IT IT WORKS BETTER
835,UM WHEN WE MADE THE BOATS WELL WE WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW MANY PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH WATER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF THE WELL NO BUT UM IF LIKE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT,AM WHEN WE MATE THE BOATS  O EACH WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD OR HOW HOW MUCH WATERER THEY WOULD HOOLLD AND UM IF THE HIGT WELL NOW BUT UM IF TH THE SIZE AFFECTS IT
836,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF THERE IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME JUST SEE IF IT'LL AFFECT IT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,M THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS M AN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS AM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF IT W'S A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND I EWU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT'LL EFFECT IT AT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
837,UH LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH,LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN NER ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH
838,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT WELL RECORDING INFORMATION LIKE LET'S SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING A FORTY CENTIMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN ON THE GRAPH WE WE DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE LIKE A TOWER ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION,UM A GRAF IS ABOUT WELL RECORDING YOUR INFORMATION LIKE LETS SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTERMETER STRING OF FORTY CENTIMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING TAND ON THE GRAF WE'D WE'D DO THE THIRTY CENTMETER STRING AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALLTH WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE'D MAKE AK A TOWER AL THE WAY UP TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION
839,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PER PAPER AIRPLANES AND VARIABLES THAT ARE FO UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPERCLIP AND TAPE AND IT FLIES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,AM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE WE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PPAPER AEROPLANES AND VARIABLES AT OF UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPER CLIP AND TAPE AND FLI'S BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY SHE' ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
840,UM VARIABLE IS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD AFFECT IT,VARIABLE IS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE AM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF THI COULD EFFECT IT
841,M WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID LIKE IT UM SWUNG MORE MORE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE,WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID TLIK IT UM SWUNG MORE MOREAN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM IN THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE
842,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT CONTROLLED,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY AM HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO ATSO MAKES I CONTROL
843,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SIZED OF PAPERCLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPERCLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THER DIFFERENT SIZE PAPER CLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPER CLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YE THAT'S PETY MUCH IT
844,NO WELL THE PAPERCLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPERCLIP SIZE,O WELL THE PAPER CLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPER CLIP SIZE
845,OKAY WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS OF THE BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT,OCAY AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS IS A BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT
846,UM THE WAY WE SHOWED THE RESULT IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT LIKE WELL WE HELD IT AND WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER,AND THE WAY WE SHOW THE RESULT IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT PLAIN WELL WE HELD IT AN WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER
847,UM WELL THIS KIND OF CONNECTS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU CAN DO TO SHOWS ALL THE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT JUST LIKE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR LIKE THE SLOPE LIKE RIGHT HERE,SO THIS IS THIS KIND THIS ISS EXACTLY LIKE OUR PLANE SEP WE HAVEN'T CHAT WE I THINK WE MIGHT CHANGE THE UM
848,WELL WE FIGURED OUT IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT,WELL WE FIGURED I TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE WAYG BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS S HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METRS SO THIS GRAF DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT
849,UM THE RUBBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES GETS IT TO MOVE,AM THE RUBBER BAND IT' IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KINDOF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S UST WHAT MAKES SKETZA TO MOVE
850,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,OMI LOOKS LIKE IS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR THE PLAINE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINES AND YE
851,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,A B WE'RE JUST TRAING TO JUST CINETO MAKE A COOL CONCRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER WITH A RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GOINGTO LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE ECAUSE UM YHAVE THE PROPELLER POWERN AND THEN WERE GOIN T TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT EFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER ECLIPS AND YE
852,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERS  THAT' THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST GIND TO SIT THERE
853,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USED TO BUILD IT THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
854,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THETHE FIGHT FLIGHTLINE LOKS LIKE ITS GOING UP WORD AND YA LOOK WL LOOKS LIKE ITS TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YA
855,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE O THIS ARRALL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE O PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINES SO
856,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NED SOMEWE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE WILL LIKE STAY ON SAIT THE WIRE GARG WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YA N TEN WE JUST KIND O HAVE PAP UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
857,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT INT ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S IT YOU CAN DECIDE WUT OHOW FAST YOU WANTED TO GO HOW FAR ROSROLA DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE
858,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,MWELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE AN HALFWAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AND AM THI  WELL IT ERN IT LOOKS HERE THAT THIS GRAFF WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE I SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR US TO GO M SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERED ONLY SAYS TWENTY TWO WINES FOR TWO METERS SO HA'D BE INCORRECT AND UM Y
