233,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED
234,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,YOU ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET
235,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTI TO MAKE YOUR ELECTROMISTRAWAN UST AD MORE BATTERIES FACING POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
236,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THE MORE  LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING  THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
237,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT I SE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS NUMBERS
238,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH ASING WIRE AND I CASIN WER
239,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERE IS  ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING THROUGH AND A LIGHT BULB   THE BULB ARE SHINING TREALLY BRIGHT
240,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS RIGHT,ITS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UIF YOU JUST HAVE ONE THE ELECTRICITY WILL RUN OUT AND THERE'S CERTAN N KINDS OF DIFFERENT BULBS BUT ININSIDE IT SHINES BRIGHTER
241,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
242,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
243,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE ITHE LIGHT WILL GB
244,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAS RED IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE RED
245,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FTO A PERSON
246,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BUSCING OFF OF OBJECTS WITH TH COLOR BLUE
247,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF LIGHT GREEN AND UORANGE B BECAUS YOU CAN ONLY USE THE LIGHT
248,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,O ONE AD WASHES TO BREAK IT
249,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS UNDER THE PAPER AND THE PAPER CLIP IS ON TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND
250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN I JUST ENTERD ON WASHED IT BROK ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE  THE SPACES MADE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSERVED HAPPENING IS LIKE TIRESSINGTHE WASHERS GOING
253,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,WE WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE AMIT MAKES THEAOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKE IT EVEN
254,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL TABOUTI  THE MAGNETTISM OF THE TAY IS FORCED ENOUGH
255,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROK ITS FALL
256,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET ANI MAKES I TROUGH AND  JUST REALLY REALLY RANGET DON WITH PLEASE
257,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,EIT IS UP TAT THA WITH T ASIN THINGIS JUST
258,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS ITT ANY TIME THE MAGNETS ON IT IIT REACTS LIKE
259,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHAT ISC IS THEMOTOR IS HOLDING THE IE CLIP AN TH
260,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHEREJUST SA THE SAME THING YOU USULLIN ME LAST TIME
261,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,H ARE YOU SUPPOSE TO BE SHOWING ME A MOV BECAUSE ALL I CEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP
262,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WHAT  IS IT STUCK INTO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTNG T PAPE
263,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,ONCE THE MAGNET DROPED IT WENT UNDER THE TABLE AND THEN THE MAETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET S CONNECTING IT AND HOLDING IT
264,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE ICANSTILL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNETS FORCE IS SO LIKE ITS SO STRONG
265,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS  FROM THE NAIL ANDTHE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM
266,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
267,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD UPAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
268,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT IS SHOING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM
269,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETDISM FORCES OFF AND BECAUSE A MAGNET IS MAKING IT DOTA
270,THE FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
271,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS LIGHT IT UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY TO GO U
272,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOTS OF ELECTRICITY GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND T THE LIGHT BULB
273,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHTB
274,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHENWHATTEVERS YOU JUST SWITCH I TO IT STILL WORKS THE SAME WAY
275,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOES IN A CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE TE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
276,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WAT ONE WIRE S HETING THROUGH T PIECE OF WIRE ON IS HITTING TO THE BASE WIRE
277,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,S WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT THE SET UP IS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH BOTH WIRES IN TO THE LIGHT L
278,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A CIRCUIT GOING AROUND AND AROUNDTHE L ITH HE ELECTRICITY
279,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
280,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
281,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
282,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,IT ACTS O MAGNET IC PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR S
283,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTILL THE WIRE IS CLOSE
284,UM THE ROLE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SO,MINERAL O AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS
285,SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL,SHES REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TO NMIN THE MIRO AND T IT SHOWS IT ON THE WAL
286,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF OF THE MIO THA WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CA SEE HIMSELF OFIS REFLECTION
287,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT UM REFLECTIONS THERE ARE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE IT SHINE BRIGHTER,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS HER ARE  THE WHERE THYRE ABLE   SEN HIS IM BRIGHTER
288,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND IT'S SETTING TO THE STAR,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS TA WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND IT'S ADDING TO THE STAR
289,THE GUY HE FLICK THE SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHT,THE GUY E FLICKED A SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
290,LIKE A MIRROR CAUSE SOMETIMES REFLECT IT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,LIKE A MOSOMETIMES REFLECTI  GO TO THE CENTER ORSOMETHING LIKE THAT
291,WHAT I KNOW IS UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULB LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IT ONE,WHAT I KNOW IS  CERTAIN LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCASE I ONE SPOT
292,IF ITS AND IN CONNECTS IF THIS HE DOES IN AND THEN A DOES EITHER,IF IT'S NS IT CONNECTS IF IT'S E AN S IT DOESN'T AND IF IT'S EN I IT DOESN'T EITHER
293,I THINK WHAT IS ALL ABOUT IS SHE TRYING THE FINAL WAY I GUESS NORTH OR SOUTH,I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUDRANS IN THE EARTH
294,WHAT YOU THING MORE THAN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB WENT OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECT,WHAT  THINK WATS UP WT HIS PICTURE IS MWELL IN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND THE ONES STILL CONNECT TO WR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE OTHER ONE
295,BEESLY WIRE THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDLE THING,IGT BULB IS NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE METALE THING
296,LAST YEARLY MEANS THAT ELECTRICITY WHAT GO OTHER ONE IS ELECTRICITY THAT EASY,T MEANIS THAT TO MUCH ELECTRICITY WENT THROUGH AN THE OTHER ONEELECTRICITY THAT
297,THE WIRE THE ELECTRICITY THOSE THAT'S GOING IS BECAUSE AN LIGHT BULB OF OUT,THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRICITY  FLOW STOPS GOING IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS TAT BURNS OUT
298,WHAT I THINK MORE HAPPENS IS ELECTRICITY GOES STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND LIGHT BULB IS STOP STOP LIGHTING UP,WHAT I THINK W WA HAPPEN IS  ELECTRICITY W WL STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND THE LIGHT BULB WLL SO  STOP LIGHTING UP
299,HAPPENS IS AND THE FILM WAS GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND WHAT IS ACTION,WHAT HAPPEN HA TO REPAE IT AND THE FILAMENT WILL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DA IN
300,IT MAY BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE A CONNECT INTO LINE THE,IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT THE NEXT IT'LL LIGHT UP  A
301,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THAT IS NO LIKE I MEAN,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS IS BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN LED
302,HE REASON LIKE THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEM FINAL RECHARGE IN THE WIRE LIKE ITS,THE REASON WHY I THINK THAT IS BARNI IT'S BECAUSE LAS FINALY TRCK IN THE WIRE LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
303,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THERE REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH DIFFERENT NEW ONE,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THEY REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH E DIFFERENT NEW ONE
304,I WILL CHECKS BY LIGHT BULBS I GUESS TWO OR ONE LIGHT BULB AND MORE LIGHTUP WORK,OTHER T A CICIT  N IS FIVE LIGHT BULBS AND I GUESS TOW LIGHT BULB AD SOME OF THEM WILLL LIGHT UP OR THATS
305,WHAT WE NOT DIFFERENCED BUT LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY HE WAS SWITCH SIDE,WHAT WE HELD AT THIS PI ELECTRICITY T IHTBULB AN MACDONALD IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP THE SWITCH IS
306,WHAT HAPPENING THIS ENERGY IS JUST WASTING ON INTO THE AIR BECAUSE THOSE NOW ELECTRICITY INTO,WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ENERGY IS JUST WASTING N TO THE AIR BECAUSE THERES NO WAR TO PUT  ELECTRICITY INTO
307,CIRCUIT LIGHT IS THE SERIES AND IT ADD SUCH ONE WIRE CONNECTED,CIRCUIT  THE CCOND LIGT I IS A SERIES ITHE AT LAST HAS TO BE ONE WIRE CONNECTED
308,WHAT INTO THE ELECTRICITY WENT TO THE ONE OF THE CIRCUIT WENT TO THE ITS STOPPED WORKING,INTO THE ELECTRICITY BURNS OUT ONE OF THE CIRCUIT AND WHEN IT BURNS IT OUT ITS STOPPED WORKING
309,HAVE BEEN WHEN I NOTICE ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB WILL WORK AND OTHER ONE HAS IS,AT HAPPENS THAT I NOTICE TTTONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS ORK T THE OTHER ONE THAT IS  HEL
310,BUT I NOTICE ONE LIGHT BULB THIS LIGHTING UP THIS IT IS RIGHT,WHAT I NOTICED N ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND TH OTER IS BURNTE OUT AND IT'S NOT WORKING AT ALL
311,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE 'S NO MAGNET IN IT
312,AND NOTE FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NOT DISSOLVE,IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO MBE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
313,THINGS THAT STICK MAGNET OR EITHER METAL AND ONCE USUALLY PACKED PLASTIC,THE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET ARE EITHER METAL AND THE ONES ARE USUALLYPLASTIC OR WOOD
314,THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK,THE PAPER FASTENER STAYS ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK
315,IT GOES THROUGH HOW THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONE GOES BACK INTO IT,IT GOES THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE LIND GOES BACK INTO IT
316,THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IT' NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
317,WHAT THE HAVE THEY COMPARED IS SETUP DIFFERENTLY STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY,WHAT HOW THEY COMPARE IS THEY'RE SET UP DIFFERENT WAYS BUT STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY
318,I THINK I GUESS THE WHY I AM THE MADE CHOICES,I THINK I GUSS  THE BOTTOM ANTHA CHOICES BUT
319,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO EELECTRICITY HAS STOP GOS STOP O BUT IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT B GOES AROUND AND THA CAU AND BACKIN
320,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOUR AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT WELL THERE IS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE ONE
321,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,WAT I NOTICE ABOUT THE PATHWAY  THE ENERGY IS TO COME M F DIFFERENTCONNECTIONS
322,WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WELLTHI BEST ONE NOW I GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THERE'S NOT WASTE ING ENERGY
323,THE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THE CONNECTED RIGHT,THE FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP BECAUSE THE WAY ITI GOING CAUSE IT'S CONNECTED RIGHT
324,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,WAT I NOTICED THERE'S ENERGY THAT'S GOING OUT INTO THE BATTERY THAT'S GOING INTO THE BATTERY
325,IF THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS,THE KINDS OF CIRCUITS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
326,THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,U THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHTS UP IT BURNS OUT AND YOU HAVE TO REPLACEIT WITH ANOTHER ONE
327,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE U CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE MORE
328,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE  PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUIT
329,OH SO IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND,UH SO IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND
330,UM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO,UM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO
331,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP
332,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WILL FLOW THROUGH,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WIL FLOW THROUGH
333,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE
334,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH IS IT A CIRCUIT,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH THE LITTLE CIRCUIT
335,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT
336,IT MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS MATERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS
337,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS
338,BECAUSE THE SOUTHS CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE THEY WOULD PUSH AWAY,BECAUSE THE SOUTH CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY
339,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
340,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELEC IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELEC IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON AND WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
341,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNET STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
342,THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPERCLIP MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK,THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPER CLIP MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK
343,WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES 'EM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES,WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSSHING THEM TOGETHERD THAT MAKES THEM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ON IT MOVES
344,WELL BECAUSE THE DIS THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK,WELL BECAUSE THE DISTHE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK
345,ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON,IT ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
346,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
347,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH ABOUT MAGNETISM,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH  MAGNETISM
348,THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH,THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAP
349,WHEN IT'S ON IT'S OFF AND WHEN IT'S OFF IT'S ON,WELL PART OF ITS RONG IT DOESN'T
350,IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OTHER CIRCUITS USUALLY HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT WITHOUT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM,IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OTHER CIRCUITS USUALLY HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT WITHOUT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM
351,IT THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE,IT THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
352,THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE,THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
