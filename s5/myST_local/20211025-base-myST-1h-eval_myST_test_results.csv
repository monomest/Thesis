0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIDED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE HOLE CLAST WIS SORT OF CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHAINGE ENY THINGCAUSE WE DIDN'T ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEX STAYE SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL F THE WAY UP TO TWENY TWO
1,OKAY,OKAYY
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,UH WE HAVEN'T  REALLY YOU DON GRAVHES THAT MUCH THIS YER
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THEY'RE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERY ONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHAT EVER HIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HING IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH
4,YEAH,YEAH
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,UM PROBVBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANCERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY NOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANTID JUST SAY O THAT'S IT I NOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CON ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNES AND THEN I THINK THE HOL CLASK WAS COMVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE ISORT OF MOVED ON TTHE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,UM PROTHEL EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT PINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE HAT IT'S CAULT BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNES TO IT TO SO WE SSOW T THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENTS I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YEAH A LITTLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO TDID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEND THERE IS HORSONTOE LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD AO TEACH OR AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG INTHE SMALLEST AND WE RO ON ONE TIME IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTENTS THEY DID LIKE A TEN INCH AT TEN CENNIMETERS I GASS MAYBY I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THERE LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THEIRE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,O THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WA'S A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GES SOMEBUDY B JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRYZED IT AGAIN THE NEAX TACAUSE AND SO ATER WE TRYZED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF COMVIENTED DUS THAT THES SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS THAT GOTSO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRYIDED TO JUST HOLLD THEM UM LIKE EXACTLY WTHE WEAIGHT OUR DESK WHERE IT OUR DESK END WE WOUD HOL THEM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GASKD HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEN SECANDS AND I GESS ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRYED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY AIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EAIGHT SCENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIDE TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,UM YEAUH IT S DID GRAFFING TO YESTERDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY
14,MATH,MATHA
15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,OKAY
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGER LIKE IT WULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO YOU ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLEREND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE THE LEAST WINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,UM HEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVER ONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDID
19,OKAY,OKAY
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE CHWE TRYED TO THINK WHAT COULD OFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM UH PSTARTING POINT AND THEN UM  LIKE THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRYIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE IS FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
21,YEAH,YEAH
22,OKAY,OKO
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SYSTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT R WAS SOI EXPLINE TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENLLAM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS W GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP IN A PENNY AND NYOU UD TAUCH THE STRING TOTHE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I I I DIDN'T TELLAR THIS BUT THE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENILLUM THE STRING OF THE PENGL AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STHE PENUL AND SSWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECANDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENILLAM STRING LONGER
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YES WE S  IN PENILUNGS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE LIKE WE WERE TESTING UM IN FIFTEEN SECANDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HING THEM ON A PENCSAL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOUL HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECANDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRYID TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVF OUR DESK OR BUT BE UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE CEPT HAVING T EXPERIMENTETE UNTILL EVERY ONE LIKE WAS WAS COMVINCTED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,OKAY
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'T DON THAT YAT
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MAGDE ME THE MOST SURPRIZSES PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YEAH LIKE SOMEPEOPLEGOT A LEVEND SOME PEPLE GOT THIRTTEEN OR FORTTEEN BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUST WANTID TO HELP THAT I GESS
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES THACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE WHT WE SAW WE LIKE WE WOCK BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WOCKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEUW UP TO THE WIT NUMBER IT WENT TOO WT HOW HIY IT WENT AND THEN WE WELD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISH DOING AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OFP DOWN
34,UM WE,UHM WE
35,WE WERE USING,WE WERE USING
36,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN ITWE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SHE WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING IN STUFF
37,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP,UH YEAF WE DID THE TESKS WITH THAT GROUP
38,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WE JUST FINISH DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLE UM WHERE HOW FAR ORE UM HOW NOT FARE YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LONCHOTHING AND THEN THE UHM LIKE ADS THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALL SO HOW FARE IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
39,YEAH,YEAH
40,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,UM TO GRAFF IT SO YOU KNOW WELL I WILL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPEND DIDN'T WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A HO BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENGJULLUMS BOUTS M UH S UM WHAT ELS WE DID UM FIRES AND THEN FLIPPERS
42,YEAH,YEAH
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,WE THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CLUP WHEN WE SHOWE THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAY BE WHY MISS MORGJUR DIDN'T AGREEWITH THE ING
44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHEAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK OW HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPOSED TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST  A REGULAR BALLBUT ALL WEA BAT N BUT THEN MIS MODO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WHE USE LIKE A COARKTHING A COARK THING SO MAYBE THAT TWY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT ITFECTS THE OUT COME OF AN EXPERIMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDERD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS OUT COM ON OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAD EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO NOW AND YOU TRY DO NOWU THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPEND IN STUFF
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,UM WE WITH THE RESSOLTS WE RECORTED THEM ON A GRAFF
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,IND IT LOOK  LIKE THAT IT WENT UP
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,NOW WE JUST FINNISH DOING THET FLIPPERS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE HOLK CLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,MM MYEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TESTED IT W DID LIKE WE HAD THES SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAS LIKE SIX FIVE FOR THREE TO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THEWAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TO ONE OF T
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,WL THEN YOU OUL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHE THE FORE BCAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHE AND WE TESTED IT FORE TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL A A R SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET Y THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IND WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT OF FOR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFT TIMES AND THEN WE THAT' WE DID IT FORE TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE TITOGETHER ON THE COWLCULATER AND THEN DIVIDED IT BT FORE AND THAT WAS A RESSOULT AND YEAH
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WE ALL CAME UP WITH THERE VARIABLES ALMOST THE OL CLASSTIN AND THEN ATER THAT WE SORIT OF THE HOLL CLAST GOT TO CHUSE LIKE SHULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN THE GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THER OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH WHEN THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FARE ARE HOW UM HOW FARE IN THE STICK WAS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE EXAXES AND THEN WE WOCKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FO THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE WY AXES WELL THE WY AXES S RIGHT HERE THE EAXESI IX RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNOR THE WHERE THEY MEAT AND WE WOCKED AND LET SAY I WENT TO HOW FARE SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE WY AXES THERE WAS UM WA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW FOR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DON
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAPH I DON'T KNOW HEN IT'S CARD STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN EX AXS IN A Y AXIS THE EX AXIS AS WHAT WE NOW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHIT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND NOUW
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT WAS  THAT WAS HOW FARE IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE NOUO HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIY IT WENT
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE IN A LUMIANE BALL IND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAT OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZSE ALL THAT
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,M HM AND THEN WEILL SO SEND SIXS S ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WECEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGRE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EATHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIER THE FARTHER OUT IT WHENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WERED BECAUSE WE TRYE WE WHEN'T WE FIRST WER GETTING INTO ET WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND M SHE CHOS TO PEPLE TO TRY AT ME AND TRAVES ANNOTHER BUL IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UMD I TRYED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPD IT UTP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRYED IT AGAIN AND IT STI WENT LO AND THEN TRAVES TRYIED AND YOU PUSH THE STICK ALL THE WAY INTO SICX AND IT WENT REEALLY HYE AND THEN WE GOT OPPOSIT
63,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO,NO NO BUDY EALLS DID THE  EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO
64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,THAT WAS FARTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENUGF SUM IF IT WASN'T ENUGH SPINGS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELLTHER POWER FR THTHURG WEIGAS
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,WE MADE PLANS THAT LOOK LIKE THATT
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAV MORE FORCHE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASENGERS ON THA BIG REAL PLANE SO I BED THE HEAVE THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GOING TO GET THE MORE STHE MORE SPINS U WE NO WE'V ARE TESTING THE VARIABLE TODAY WE DIDN'T WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD TO SCIENTS AND THEN T AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRYHTHED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK TWO WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFF WAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD ET
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE JUST DUEST GAS THO WHAT NUMBERAY
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL Y AND THEN WE CRIE WE JUST TRYDED  HLIKE T JUST PLLIGHT AROUND WITH IT A LITTL AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REL EXPIRIENS MENT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE ENDTO THE CHARE AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOST END TO USS CAUSE IT THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE WTWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO NO HO THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO PE EA SO WE COULDND DO IT ANY MORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLYGOT FIFTY TO SO WE DID IT IND FIFTY TO S
71,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTIEND ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWNH THAT WOULD BE COOL
72,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETE FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOUR METERS,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CETIMETER FOR HUNDRED TENTIMETERS IS FORMING
73,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YEAH  ACTU LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE JUST IDED IT WAS TO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY OENE AF LIKE MORE A LITTLE MORE THAN HAFF WAY SO THEN WE JUST JUST SIED TO TRYE SIXTY AND WE TRIDED SIXTY AND PRETTY MUCH WEN EXACTLY AHL
74,YEAH,YEAH
75,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YEAH WERE NOT CHANGING THE SLOP FORE NOT CHANGING THE COOKID NESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WERE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ONGGO YEAH WERE' KEEPING FORTY SPINS WHE'RE JUST TRYING FORTY SPINS INK THIS S A REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
76,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
77,YEAH,YEAH
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S  LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEMFLY  I WANT THIS SWINGERS  ECAUSE THE WE HAVE THIS VARIABLE BOXK AND IT'S SHOW IT SHOWSE HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UHM A WOMAN DOING AH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO H SEE AND THES OMAN WAS DOING A FROUNT HAND SPRING OFF THE O SHEE WIS DOING A BOALT AND I DO BA LIKE I TAKES MASSTICKS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN V
79,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SONG LIKE AWH YEAH FOR METERS
80,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINGS IT TAKES A SPING AS LIKE SO YOU GO AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER METS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR PAB YEAH ONE TO LIKE YEAH AND THEN ATER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY JTESTED IT LIKE ONES
81,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOUP LIKE ONE CHAIRE WAS BIGE RND THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROP IF YOU START ID FROM THE TOP IT WULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PARTED IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WULD JUST FALLSO THAT WAS LOUP UM ONE WAS UM WAITHT SO I DID TIGHT NES OF THE STRING SLOUP UM CROOKID NS O MABLE THE CHARES WERE CROKIED
82,I DON'T KNOW,WKHAY
83,OH YOU'RE WELCOME OKAY,U YEGRUKOKAY
84,HELLO,LO
85,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
86,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,ALL THE ALL THERE M FLINGERS THE FPURS AND THEN WE B EARE THE UF THE PENSILLUEMS AND THEN THE BOATS OSSE
87,YEP,YEP
88,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO HO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING IT AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWAY SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE N ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KI I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HAFF WAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRYED TO DO WE TRYED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTINAIDED AGAIN BCAUSE PUNS WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSER WE TRYIED JUST WE JUSTDID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWEIGHET SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRYIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORK AND THE ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HAFF ABOUT FIFTY TO AND THE PROBUM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIX STY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHAINGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KIND THINGI THINK THAT WE URE TIS COWINTING I GESS MAYBEY

111,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERYONE GOT A DIFFERENT UM MILLILITER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PA NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT W NUMBERS OF MILLILITERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW,SO THE WATER WE JUST SWEARNTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OAR THREY CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERY ONE GOT A DIFFERENT A MILLILITER OF WATERS LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUD RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PAT NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENENT NUMBERS OF MILLILITERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW
112,AND THEN AFTER WE PUT UM I GOT SEVENTEEN PENNIES BEFORE MY BOAT SANK AND THEN SO YEAH,AND THEN AFTER WE PUT UM I GOT SEVEN TEEN PENNES BEFORE MY BOAT SSANK AND THEN SO YEAH
113,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF THE GRAPH OH YEAH THANK YOU AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOAT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOAT FOUR BUT I'M AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF ITE OH YEAH THINK YAH AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HEAR AND IT HAD LIKE BOUT ONE BOUT TWO AND BOUT THREE AND AL SO BOT FOR B AND MNUCHES AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAIDS TH UM NAMES
114,WELL I RE I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OUR BUT UH WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETER I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AMO MILLILITERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY,WELL I I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OARS BUT UTH WE GOT A LOT MEAN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE ENNIMATERS I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDREDAND FIVE M  A MILLEILTERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY
115,YEAH CAUSE THIS IS THE Y AXIS I THINK X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE Y AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGERS,H CAUSE THIS IS THE WY AXESOTHING EX AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE WY AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGUER I
116,UM THAT WAS WE WOULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY IN S YOU COULD JUST FLIP OVER,UM THAT WAS WE WULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THANT PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIVE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OBSIBE OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YO ON'T WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY AND SYOU COULD JUST FLIP OER
117,UM CAPACITY IS SORT OF THE WATER HOW MUCH WATER YOU GOT IN IT AND THEN YOU DO,UM CAPACITY IS SORT OF THE WATER HOW MUCH WATER YOU GOT IND IT AND THEEN
118,I'M ALMOST DONE,MARMOS TAND
119,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS AND STUFF YEAH UH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND UH THEN,WHELL WE WER PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD TO PART NISE AND STUFF YEAT UH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND H THEN
120,MMM PROBABLY BECAUSE WE DID SCIENCE YESTERDAY SO OKAY MMM HMM YOU'RE WELCOME,PROBABLY BECAUSE WE DID SINE  YES TORDAY SO MM KA I HYUOM
121,UH LESS BECAUSE THIS E IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND IT ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND,U LESS BECAUSE THIS IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE  MEASURED LIKE FIVE SENTIMETERS AND THAT WHENE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO SENTIMETER AND U ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER AND JHUSS BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND
122,AND THEN PASSENGERS,AND THEN PASSENGERS
123,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N E CAUSE MY K PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FI SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE IT'S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN UP HERE YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE,AND THEN SO UND WE CALLD ONE OF OURS THE AS AS AND EA CAUSE MKE PARTNER WAS MAYTHEN SO AND THEN OUR CAPASCITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLD THIS THIS WAS THE THIRTY SENNIMETE OR ONE SO OR CAPASCITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER ALL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAIH SEVENTY FIVE SEVEN TEEN AND SO FIRST WE WOCKED AND WE DID THE CAPASCITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE RIGHT HEARE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEUO UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVEN TEEN  HAR YEAS AND THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UPPHEARE
124,YEAH,YEAAH
125,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID AH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VOATS AND WE TRYZED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTH OF BOTS LIKE I DID FICE WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THRETY SCENTIMETERS AND FOR CENTIMETERS
126,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY UM IT WAS JU THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY WHICH WUD UM THEY WAS THEY WERE JU T DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOWH
127,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPASIT OF WHEN IM THING IN TO DAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THE'RE SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUTCH MORE EASALLY THEN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SENTS THE THINGS A'RE SO HYH THE EDGES ARE SO HYH IT CAN'T GET IN
128,NO,N
129,OH YOU CAN HAVE IT,OD YOU CAN HAVE IT
130,YEAH CAUSE LIKE,YEAHCAUSE LIKE
131,YEAH,YEAH
132,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAPH A LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAVE A LOT I GESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMERY TO REMEMBER STUFF TAILL
133,IT WAS LIKE A PAGE WE GOT,IT WAS LIKE A PAGE WE GOT
134,LIKE PROBABLY,LIKE PROBABLY
135,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOUGH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL AND LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE,H YEAW WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CAUT THE MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WORK BEFORE WE FLYE I FORGET WHAT GRAFF IT WAS CALLD THEO THUT W LIKE WITH OUR BOATS TIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH HA PENSL LIKE ON THE GRAVE WE GRAVE WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELLED AND THEN WE WOULD WOK TO IT LIKE ITWOULD SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPASCITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN IT WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SHIR
136,WE PUT EM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN THEY WERE OUR PASSENGERS,WE PUT TIM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNES IN THEY WERE OAUR PASENGERS
137,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE IS
138,YEAH,YEH
139,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN AND WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S E N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY,MOKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN WE PUT A DOT THER THEN THIS WAS THE AS AS  AND AND IT WAS OUR FIVE SENTAMETER BOUT WE GOT A HUNDREAND FIVE CAPASCITY S WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN AR PASENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN ITS F THING YEAH LIKE YEH IT WOULD BE HIER WULD BE LIKE WRIGE HER PARBLESL
140,YEAH,YEAH
141,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PR YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS,WELL YE HAVE SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS IN MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE YEAH SED EXACTLY IN THEIR DIRECTION
142,AND THEN,AND THEN WHIY DID YEU BIG RS
143,YEAH,YEAH
144,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE BUT S WE CEIRLY MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETER AS THREEY SCENTIMETERS UM CURAL WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THRETY CENL ERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUARTED WATER FROM A SURRINGE INTO IT AND THEN UCKTIT UP WITH THE SORINGE AND PUT I INTO UH GRADGULLATED CENNT SILLINDERS AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
145,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OKAY THAT O KAY THAT YOU ERI TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IS SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SOURT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO AFFECT THA AFFECT TE OUT CUME SO WE MAKE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE RUFF WATERS AND YO PUT IT IN BECAUSE RUFF WATER'S N THE END OUF GOOD WITH BOTS AT ALL
146,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING
147,YEAH,YEAH
148,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DID THIS WAS OUR TWO SENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROUF UP HAILL WE DIDN'T REMER E  HE  YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THISS I GESS
149,YEAH,YEAH
150,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,UHM WE DIDNT WE PUT NO NO NOW BUT WHEN I TALKE TO AVL WE DIDN'T DO OR UH YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE DMADE OUR BOUT BUT WE NEVER PUT THAT WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO

152,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,WEAH YEAH WE DID WE LIK I SORT OF FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT NIRIS WE TALKED ABOUT HARI THINGS
153,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME,BUT THEY'RE NOT SAME
154,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREY CENIMETER VOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRYDE ALLF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BORD THE WIGHT BORD AND WE ROUT LIKE BUT NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOUT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE IT WAS A HUG WRAIND OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
155,YEAH,YEAH
156,UM YEAH,UM YEAH
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRYE TO HAVE THE SAHE OR HOLLA CLASS WANTED TO TRYE TO FIND OUT HOW HOW WE COULD GET AN OUT COM AGAIN O LIKE OF THE SAME OUT COM AND GET FIN FIND IN N A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DINGFOR TO THE PENNIES AND LIKE FIT THE THREE SCENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,YEAH PFROB OF THE YEAHYEAH
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FARE AWAY FROM DROP INTO THE BOTTOM WHEN I DROP THE PENNY AND IT DROP TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROP TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME INSO
160,YEAH,YEAH
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YEAH A BECAUSE ID YOU WANT TO HAVE FIND WE WANT TO HAVE A EXPLONATION FOR OR EXPERIENMENT AND WHAT HAPPENDS IN THE END LIKE THE OUT COME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTER WARDS YOU WANT TO NOW THE OUT COME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO AN H END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS AND EACH ONE THEN ARE ARE THER OR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A UM ALL IND ALL UM MO UH A THREE SCENTIMETER ABOUT USUALLY HOLVE TWELVE SENDT TWELLVE PENNES
162,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YEESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW IT HUR NABUES STES OR THE YEAH UM I TOLD HUR THAT I THOUT THAT BIGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LHE MLESS NO LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNES AND SMALER BOTS L D LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMATER ABOUT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNES AND I FOR GET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY AIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REEASON WASE BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW AND THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVF AND IT DIDN'T THINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOVW THE WATER JUST GOS IN THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM

834,WHEN IF YEAST AND WATER AND AND IF YEAST WATER AND ANIMAL CRACKERS THE YEAST WILL BE MORE CARBON DIOXIDE WITH THE ANIMAL CRACKER THAN WITHOUT IT,IF WHEN IF YEAST AND WATER AND AND IF YEAST WATER AND ANIMAL CCS WILL MAKE THE YEAST WILL MAKE MORK OF THAN DIOXIDE WITH THE ANIMAL PATH I WITH OUT IT
835,THE COOKIE IS PROVIDING THE COOKIE IS PROVIDING FOOD FOR THE YEAST AND THE WATER IS MAKING IT COME ALIVE AGAIN IT WAS FROM IT'S DORMANT STAGE,THE COKIE IS PRERVIDING IAH COOKIE WIS PROVIDDING FOOD FOR THE YEAST AND THE WATERS MAKING IT CUM ALIVE AGAIN IT WAIS FROM IT'S DOIMENT STAGE
836,PLANTS DON'T REALLY NEED SHELTER,PLANTS DON'T REALLY NEE ED SCELTER
837,SO ONE THAT'S YELLOWISH GREEN AND THE ONE THAT WAS RED GREEN WAS IN THE LIGHT,SO ONE THAT YELLOW ISH GREEAN WAS IN THE DARK AND THE ONE THAT WAS BRED GREAM WAS IN THE LIGHT
838,THEY DO I THINK THEY DO CAUSE WATER IS ESSENTIAL TO ALL LIFE YES ALL LIFE,THEY DO I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WHAT WATER IS A SENTUAL TO ALL LIFE YES ALL LIFE
839,THE SUNLIGHT WATER AND CHLOROPHYLL INSIDE THE LEAVES,THE SUNLIGHT WATER AND COA FILL ON THE LEAVES
840,AIR IS NOT PLANTS DO NOT LIKE WIND THAT MUCH AND THEY DON'T NEED IT,AR IS NOT PLANTS DO NOT LIKE ONES THAT'S MUCH AND THEY DON'T KEED IT
841,A BOTTLE WITH TOMATO AND A PLANT LIKE AGAIN,A BOTTLE WAS TO MATLO AND A PLANT LIKE AGAIN
842,I SEE A CHEESEBURGER AND A PLANT THE CHEESEBURGER MEANS FOOD AND YES THE PLANT DOES NEED FOOD EXCEPT DIFFERENT SORT OF FOOD NOT LIKE THAT,I SEE IT CHEES BUG  IN A PLANT THE CHES BUG MEANS FOOD AND YES THE PLANT DOESN'TNEED FOOD SEY A DIFFERENT SORT OF FOOD NOT LIKE TH
843,IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING VERY HEAVY YOU NEED TO USE KILOGRAMS,IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING VERY HEAVYOU NEED O YUCE KILLIGRAMS
844,SOUNDS LIKE KILL A GRAM,SOUNDS LIKE KILLE A GRAM
845,COULD I HOLD IT FOR A SEC,COUD I HOLD IT
846,WE HAD LIKE TWENTY PIECES AND FIVE PIECES AND TEN PIECES AND ONE PIECES,WE HAD LIKE TWENTY PIECES AND FIVE PIECES AND TEN PIECES IN ONE PIECES
847,YEAH,YEAH
848,WITH THE PIECES,WITH THE PIECES
849,YES,YES
850,MMM HMM WITH ROCKS WE WE UM WE HAD TEN DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THAT EACH ONE OF US MEASURED OUT A HUNDRED GRAMS IN ROCKS,MM HMM WITH ROCKS WE WE UM WE HAD TEN DIFFERENT GROUPS IN EACH ONE OF US MEASURED OUT A HUNDRED GRAMS IN ROCKS
851,THEN YOU NEED TO ADD MORE TO THE ONE OR ANOTHER,THEN YOU NEED TO AD MORE TO THEA ONE WORE ANOTHER
852,UH SOMETIMES IN PAPER CLIPS BUT UM,UH IT SOMETIMES ION PAPER CLIPS BUT UM NMIN
853,OR A FRIDGE,OR A FERINGE
854,AND THEN WE PUT IT ALL IN A BAG,AND THEN WE PUT IT ALL IN OR BAG
855,WHAT HAPPEN,WATD HAPPEND
856,WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT ON IT'LL PROBABLY TELL YOU THE ANSWER,WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUTROUM NWILL PROBABLY TELL EASY ANSER
857,A STANDARD MEASUREMENT E IS LIKE THE METRIC SYSTEM IT'S ALL THE SAME EXCEPT FOR IN AMERICA,A STANDERD MEASUR MENT IT IS LIKE THE MEATRIC SYSTEM IT'S ALL THE SAME EXEPFORR ANT MERRICA
858,JUST A SEC,JUST OF SICU
859,YEAH,YEAH
860,I COULD TELL THEM A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,I COULD TELL THEM A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUAL A KILOGRAM
861,YES YOU NEED TO HAVE A STANDARD TO DO,YES YOU NEED TO HAVE A STANDERD TO DO
862,WELL TODAY WE HAVEN'T DONE MATH YET,WELL TODAY WE HAVEN'T DUN MASS YET
863,YOU PUT THE GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY MEASURED OUT UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY LEVEL IT'LL,YOU PUT THE GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND ON TAILL IT'S COMPLEATELY MEASURED OUT IN TAILL IT'S COMPLEATELY LEAVLE ITAL
864,THE INK,THE INK
865,WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS IT'S JUST,WE DIDN'T DO THE SAME CLAS ATS STRIAS
866,B L T,BE ELT
867,UM WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS IS JUST BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE,WE DIDN'T DO THE SAME CLASE THIS WAS JUST BACK ORAN NOLLIGE
868,BUT WE HAD GROUPS OF FOUR,BUT WE HAD GROUPS OF FOR
869,HELLO,ALLOW
870,OR A MICROWAVE,OR A MINTER WAY
871,NOT REALLY,NOT REALLY
872,AND THEN WE PUT IT OUR HUNDRED GRAMS INTO ONE BIG BAG,AND THEN WE PUTED  OUR HUNDRED GAMS WIT THE ONE BIG BAG
873,UH A D A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS,UH UH POK AR CHIP THAT WAS LIKE IX GRAMS
874,OKAY LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A STEEL BALL JUST COMPLETELY CIRCULAR STEEL BALL AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND THEN A VASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOWL SO THE WHEN THE WATER FALLS OUT IT'LL GO INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL INTO THE WATER MOST OF THE YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WATER'S IN IT THOUGH FOR THIS TO WORK WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL IN WHEN THE WATER COMES OUT AS MUCH WATER IS STILL IN THE VASE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S IN IT BECAUSE IT PUSHES IT OUTWARD UNTIL IT'S SETTLED,O KAY LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A STEL BULB JUST COMPLEATELY CIRCUILA STEAL BULB AND YOU HAVE A BULB AND THEN A BASE IN TH MITTL OFTHE BULB SO THE WHEN THE WATER FALLS OUT AND L GO INTO ITWHEN YOU PUT IT IN TO IT WHEN YOU PUT THE STEAL BULLB INTO THE WATER MOST  THE YOU HAVE TO NOW HOW MUCH WATER'S IN IT THE FOR THIS TO WORK WHEN YOU PUT THE STEL BULL IN THE WHEN THE WATER COMESIS OUT AS MUCH WATER IS STELL IN THE BASE THAT'S THE ANDRTHAT'S IN IT BECAUSE IT PUSH ES IT OUT WEARD ONTIL IT'S CETTLED
875,WHAT HAVE WE WORKED ON THIS WEEK WELL THIS WEEK THE IN THE THREE DAYS IN THIS WEEK WE'VE WORKED ON MEASUREMENT AND MASS,WHAT IF WE WORKED ON THIS WEAKE WELL THIS WEAK THE IN THE THREE DAYS IN THIS WEK WE'VE WORKED ON MEASURE MENT AND MASS
876,UH HUH OR LEVEL,MM HMOR LEVEL
877,HOW THAT WORKS IS IT'S LIKE A PRESS,HOW THAT WORKS S ITS LIKE A PRESS
878,I KNOW AS IN LIKE KILL A GRAM,I KNOW THY SOUNDS LIKE KILLED A GRAM
879,HOW DO I MEASURE MASS WITH THE BOWL AND THE THE UM VASE AND THE STEEL BALL OR OR ANYTHING YOU WANT LIKE AN ORANGE OR,HOW  I MASUR MASS WITH THE BULLE AND THE THEUM THEY S AND THE STEAL BULB OR OR ANYTHING YOU ONT LIKE AN ORANGER
880,YOU HAVE TO DEPEN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON,B YOU HAVE TO DEPEND AN DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON
881,WE PUT IN TEN OF THOSE,WE PUT IN TEN OF THOS
882,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED,NO BIT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED
883,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,A THOUSAND GRAMSEQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILL GRAM
884,GRAMS YEAH OH I JUST THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE,GRAMS YEAH OH I JUST LOK SOUCH A MENT THE
885,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHING IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP,I SAY MASS IS THE AIRIA THE SOMETHING IS THE SPASE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP
886,HA IT WEIGHED LIKE TWENTY,HUH IT WEIGHES LIKE TWENTY
887,THAT THAT WOULD BE WAIT JUST A SEC,THAT THAT WOULD BE WEAYJUST TOF CIRCL
888,SEVEN SEVEN INCHES,SEVEN SEVEN INCHES
889,PROBABLY THE MASS,PPROBABLY THE MAS
890,AND THAT ADDED UP IN TO TWO HUNDRED,AND THAT I HOUNED IT ULP AND TWO TWO HUNDRED DGREGS
891,WE HAD A SCALE,WE HAD OA SCAILL
892,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME
893,YES,YES
894,IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE MORE HEAVY,IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE MORE HEAVY
895,MMM HMM AND THEN PUT THEM INTO A ONE BIG BAG AND THEN IT EQUALED ONE KILOGRAM,AND THEN PUT THEM INTO ONE BIG BAG AND NEAR EQUAL TO ONE KILLD THEM
896,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF A TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WHEN IT'S ON,HOW WAD I FILING THE MASS O AF TOASTER WATER EXEPT FOR NOT WHEN THE SUN
897,NO BECAUSE ALL PA THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE IT'D BE SMALL,NO BECAUSE O TH PAPER THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CAE WOULD BE SMALL
898,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MATH MASS IS WITH WATER O A BOWL AND A VASE,HOW DI YOU MASUR MARTHMASS IS WITH WATER  A BULLE AND  VASCE
899,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRAM PIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OUR GRAM PIECES WE MEASURE LIKE E THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE GRAM PIECES,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRAM PIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WHERE USING OUR GRAM PIECES WE MEASURE LIKE THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE GRAM PIECES
900,WELL THE MASS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASS THAT THESE TAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT QUARTERS OF THIS TABLE,WELL THE MAS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASS THAT THEY STAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIAHT QUORTERS OF THIS TABLE
901,YES,YES
902,SO IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SI SIX SIX FIVE GRAMS,SO IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SIXSIXSIX FIVE GRAMS
903,BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE RIGHT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,BECAUSE NOT EVERY BUODY WOULD BE RIGHT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
904,FALLS OUT,FALLS OUP
905,NO TEN HUNDRED GRAMS,NO TEN HUNDRED GRAMS
906,TODAY,TODAY
907,YEAH AND WE EACH MADE FIFTY GRAMS,YEAH AND WE EACH MADE FIFTY GRAMS
908,YEAH YEAH LIKE UM LET'S SAY A TOASTER,YEAH YEAH LIKE UM LHAT'S SAY A TOSTER
909,ESTIMATING IS LIKE A GUESS,ESTIMATING IS LIKE GUES
910,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY I'S BEEN USED A LOT
911,WE CAN USE A GRAM PIECE FOR MEASUREMENT,WE CAN USE A GRAM PECE FOR MEASUREMENT
912,HOW I DID IT,HOW I DIDIT
913,AND THE HEAVIEST ONE WAS THE LUG NUT,AND THE HEAVIEST ONE WAS THE LUOGNOT
914,GRAMS,GRAMS
915,I DID THAT IN MY HOMEWORK,I DID THAT IN MY HOLM WORK
916,E THEY HAD THIS LITTLE WHITE BAR AND THEN THIS PIECE THAT GOT POKED OUT FROM THE INSIDE OUT NOT LIKE A HOLE BUT LIKE E IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT LIKE THE INSIDE OF IT LIKE THAT'S THE REGULAR INSIDE OF IT AND THEN IT'S LIKE THAT,THEN Y HAVE THIS LITTLE LIGHT BAR AND THEN THER'S PE THAT GOT POLKED OUT FROM THE INSIDE OUT NOT LIKE A HOLE BUT LIKE IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT LIKE THE INSIDE OF IT LIKE THAT SRER RELD INSIDE OF IT N THE IT'S LIKE THAT
917,THEY MIGHT THINK BELIEVE ME BUT IF THEY'RE SMART THEY WOULDN'T,THEY MIGHT SINK BELEAVE ME BUT IF THEY'RE SMART THEY WOULDON'T
918,YES WHY THAT'S HELPFUL IS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS,YES WHY THAT'S HELPFUL S TO NOW HAT THE WETHER IS
919,HOW MIGHT THAT HAPPEN IS BE JUST BECAUSE PHYSICS,HOW LIKT THAT HAPPEND IS BE JUST BECAUSE FISICS
920,WE WERE MEASURING TEMPERATURE WITH A THERMOMETER,WE'RE MEASURING TEMPERATURE WITH THERMOMETER
921,IT DOESN'T FREEZE LIKE EXACTLY THEN LIKE,IT DOESN'T FREASE LIKE EXACTLY THEN LIKEH
922,BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS OUR LAST DAY OF MEASUREMENT,BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS OUR LAST DAY OF MIXTUREMANT
923,OVER TIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE ICE STARTED TO MELT,EALFOR TIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE I STARTED TO MELL
924,THAT'S THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS,THAT'S THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS
925,IS IT ALWAYS ENDS UP IN A THOUSAND,IS IT ALWAYS ENDS UP IND A THOUSAND
926,WELL I WON'T BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE AN ENTOMOLOGIST,WELL I WILL BECAUSE I HA THEBE ANNOUNTTORMOLERGIEST
927,WE WE MEASURED LIKE WATER,BE WE MEASURED LIKE WATER
928,THEY'RE LIKE THAT,THEY'RE LIKE THAT

998,YES THE DEGREES OF CELSIUS YES,YES THE DEGREES OF SCELSIUS YES
999,OR AT SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE THE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU PUT IN IT,OR SOMEPINTE IT DOES THAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE THEBUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH IC UPLER DIDN'T IT
1000,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S HA GONNA HAPPEN IS B'S ACTUALLY GONNA OVERCOME THE A,THEYRE MEAX THING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S HOW GOING TO HAPAND IS B IS ACTUALLY CANT OVER COME THE A

1059,UH A FULL DIAPER WITH ALL OF WATER,UH O FOOL BYBER WITH ALL OF WATER
1060,YEAH AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY IT'D FILL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY MMM TWO HUNDRED,YEAH AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY I FRIL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED
1061,SO MMM HMM,SOALL M M HUMAN
1062,HMM OKAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO,HMUM OK AVH WELL WE ESTIMATED IN NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TUOCK TO
1063,JUST A SEC YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NINE,DRUST ID O SCICXKYE HUHM PRETTY SURE IT'S MIN
1064,NOT A LITTLE WHILE JUST PRETTY BY YEAH,NOT A LITTLE WIRE JUST PRETTY CLOSE YEH
1065,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME,IT MADE ME THINK THE YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BEATTER AMASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME
1066,MMM HMM N MMM,MM WE U MO
1067,WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER,WHAT THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MASUR MENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROME TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER
1068,EH A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS UP AND DOWN,A HUNDRED SCUNTIMETERS BOABLY ABOUT THAT UP AND DOWN
1069,PROBABLY THIS OF CENTIMETER,PROBLEYS IS OB SCENTIMETER
1070,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WHERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MIN WAS THREE IN THE WITH
1071,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAW ON THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAD TO TAPE THEM E TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER,WELL IT WASN'T THE HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO A DROAW ON THE NUMBARS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DROWN THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAVE TO TAPTHUM  TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDENR AND THEN THEY ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS T ONE METER
1072,YOU HAVE HAVE TO ESTIMATE HOW BIG YOU ARE,YOU HAVE TO ESTIMATE HOW BIG YOU ARE
1073,ES YES WE HAVE,AS YES WE HAVE
1074,NO WE HAVEN'T USED IT YET,NO WE HAVEN'T USETO YET
1075,YEAH WE MADE OUR METER TAPE,YEAH WE MEAT OUR METER TYP
1076,A CENTIMETER IS TEN METERS,I SENT TIMETERS TEN METERS
1077,MMM HMM I WONDER WHERE THAT YELLOW BALL WENT OKAY,MMS HMM I WONDERD WHY THAT YELLOW BALB WENT HALOKAR
1078,OH YEAH,OH YEAHM
1079,THERE WERE TEN YEAH,THERE WERE TEN GAH
1080,EVERY TEN WE COLORED IT A DIFFERENT COLOR,EVERY TEN WE COLER DIDT A DIFFERENT COLER
1081,WHAT WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANSWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE Y WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU G IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,WE WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW IT AND SUR WHEN YOU'RE LIKE YOU WHEN YOU TRYED EVERYTHING GO GET THE ANSER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GESING I BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GETTIT YOU NOW THE YOU IF YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT TYOU NOW THE YOU GOTIT RONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO INT
1082,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING,WATS SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT IT WAS N'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIGHET LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING
1083,BUT USUALLY THEY HAVE LIKE MEASURING TAPES THERE,BUT YOU SHOLWL MEAD THAT YOU HAVE LIKE MEASURING TYPESAR
1084,WHAT KINDA THINGS DID I ESTIMATE,I WHAT KIND THINGS  ASKE TO ME
1085,OH YEAH IT WAS THE STRAW ONE,ALL YAH IT WAS THE STRALW ONE
1086,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,WONTE MAIDE ME REALLIZES OUR HOLE TAABLE MEASURED OTRS AND THEN THE OTHER GLAS RMADES M AND THEN OR THE OTHER TABLE'S MEASURED THERE S AND THERE WOD DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM
1087,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,WELL BECAUSE WO'RE GONG TO BE STARTING MEASUREMENT MAONTHS TOM
1088,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ASTIMATING ISN'T A FULLE IS IT'S LIKE A GES
1089,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,IWEAT I SCURPOSE TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATHLOXS
1090,E IT NO I DON'T REMEMBER,A IT NO I DON'T REMEMBER
1091,A HAN B A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TWENTY CENTIMETERS,I HANDS HEIT A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LENGT TAY CENIMERS
1092,YEAH,RO
1093,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A ME THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN A METER SORRY,THERE'S TEN METERS AND IN I MEAN THERE 'S TEN SENT AMETERS IN TH METER SIZDE
1094,NO EVERY TEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,NO EVERY TEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT COLLER
1095,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES,YES WHAT THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDERD MASURIMENT YES LIKE THAT PIECES A DOESKT
1096,NO,NO
1097,YEAH,YEO
1098,YEAH YARD STICK IS JUST LIKE THAT BIG AND YEAH,YEAH A YARD STICKE IS JUST LIKE THAT BIG AND YENAH
1099,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT,WELL IF WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT
1100,WE WE IN TODAY'S MATH STUMPER WE WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS L ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS,WE WE IN TO DAY SMASHS STUMPER WE WE TO A AD AS IMMATE A SA AS NIMATE WHUT THE NUMBERS WHERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS E ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREY AND THEN IT WAS
1101,NO BOTH WAYS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETER OH NOT THE PERIMETER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YEAH YEAH,NO BOTH IKE MINE WAS THREE THEN THE OTHER ONE WIS FORE THAT WAY AND THEN THES PERMENTOR UH NOT THE PRMERTER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEMBE LENGTH YEAH YEAH
1102,HOW MANY CENTIMETERS JUST A SEC A HUNDRED,HOW MARNIEY SCENTIMETER IS JUST A SEICOD A HUNDRED
1103,WELL H H I WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG,WELL HI WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GESING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SURPOSE ESTEMAT YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET INIT'S OAR RONG
1104,WELL WELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS,WELL WHELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENTIS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ENYTHING ITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS
1105,YEAH,YEO
1106,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZE STRAWS
1107,WAIT NINE,WAY NINE
1108,JUST A LITTLE SLEEVE,SIAL LEAVE
1109,THOSE MARKS WERE FOR A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,THOSE MARKS WERE FOR OF STANDERD MEASUREMENT
1110,A THOUSAND,A THOUSAND
1111,A HUN A HUNDRED YEAH AND THAT EQUALS A THOUSAND MMM HMM,A HUNDRED HUNDRED YEATHS YEAH AND THAT EQUAL'S A THOUSAND AND THE EQULS OR BATTLS IM OM HMME
1112,OKAY,OKAY
1113,THOUSAND,THOUSAND
1114,NO A HUNDRED MILLILITERS,NO A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
1115,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LITER TEN OF THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUALS ONE LITER,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OH THESE LITER TE  THE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUAIS ONE LITER
1116,WE HAD A LOT OF WATER INTO IT,WE HAD A LOT OF WATER INTO IT
1117,A HUNDRED MILLILITERS,A HUNDRED MINLILITERS
1118,WELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER WE HAD,WELL WHEN WE PORED THEM INTO A BIGER CAONTAN OR WE HAD
1119,TWO,TO
1120,TEN,HD
1121,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO WOPSINS UM I DON'T FEU I DON'T ONLY REMEMBER THE ALYEAR
1122,IS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT,ITIS BECAUSE YOUCKN' GET A STANDERD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WOCH AND YOUR PENCLE G E
1123,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REAL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTOR'S USE YEAH,YEAH WE DID A MEASURE MENT OF THE WATER YES TORDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGERN NOT LIKE A REIAL PLUNGERB BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTERS USE O YEAH
1124,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING THPLAE WITH THE WATER
1125,THAT IT TAKE UP YEAH IT'S LIKE GALLONS,THAT I DAK CUKYES  GALLANE
1126,MAYBE A HUNDRED,MAY BE HUNDRED
1127,A HUNDRED,WIC TIK ALL YU RIGT A HUNDRED
1128,A HUN TEN,WELL TEN
1129,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE  WEREMEASURING HOW MUCH IT ISIF OR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER
1130,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S ABOUT IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDERD MEASURMENT WHAT'S IMPORTAN'T ABOUT A STANDERD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERY BOUDY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASURMENT ORE ELS IT WOULDN'T WORK
1131,THESE TWO AND THESE TWO ARE THE SAME,THESE TO AND THESE TOARD THE SAME
1132,UH WHAT THE BECAUSE OF THE METRIC SYSTEM,UH WHATS HE BECAUSE OF THE METRIC SYSTEM
1133,NOT A THOUSAND GRAMS YEAH A THOUSAND MILLILITERS,HM H MOTTLE THOUSAND GRAMS A THOUSAN YFLH YEAH A THOUSAND MELL WILLITER
1134,UH NO NOT REALLY,UM NO NOT REALLY
1135,THEY'RE BOTH EQUALLY THE SAME,THEY'RE BOTH EQUALLY THE SAME

1141,WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT,WHATTING  THAT CURIAS FAR
1142,WHAT'S IMPORT WHAT'S UM GALLONS AND LITERS AND MILLILITERS,WHAT'S IMPART WHAT'S UM GALIANS AND LITERS AND MILLILITERS
1143,YEAH UM THIS JUST FELL OFF,A UM FILLOWP
1144,YEAH,YEO
1145,E YES,ELYES
1146,ONE MIL UH UH ONE MILLILITER,ONE MNILL UH U OWN NILILATOR
1147,TEN,TEN
1148,THE SIZE OF,THI SIE AT WFIL
1149,THAT EQUAL A HUNDRED,THATD IT GOS A HUNDRED
1150,AND BY OUT,CLOS OU
1151,YES,YES
1152,YOU'RE MEASURING THE WEIGHT OF IT,THEY'RE MACURING THE WEIGHT OF IT
1153,DOESN'T LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE A SPOON NO,PE'VE MORSPRAIG OR HOW NAS PUIN THAT WOR BA<unk>NO
1154,WELL UM WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE,WELL I WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USEING THE SCAIL
1155,LITER,LITER
1156,TEN,TEN
1157,YEAH HOW MUCH SPACE IT TAKES UP,YEAH HOW MUCH VASES IT TAKES UP
1158,A THOUSAND,A THOUSAND
1159,SOME DID SOME DIDN'T,A SUNDAN SOME DAT
1160,BECUE WHY I LIKE THE SCALE,P WIRL LIKE THI SKLL
1161,NO MILLILITERS,NO MILLILITERS
1162,MMM HMM A HUNDRED,M ET TAK MAY TO FILL UP THIS A HUNDRED
1163,AND WE SQUIRT SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS ARE LIKE THAT BIG,AND WE SCUAR SEE HOW MANY VIALES IT THAT THE PLONGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FORM US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VILLS WARE LIKE THAT TIT
1164,IS TEN,JUST TEN
1165,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THANT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFICT MEASURMENT OF ALWAYS
1166,TEN OR MAYBE MORE YEAH,CENDER MAY BE WORKING
1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,TO MANE OF LIGT WATER OR WHAT
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,UT WHEN YOU INCRASE OM MOLRE BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THER LIKE CWHEN IT WRAPPED AROND HUNDRED REANTS IT PICKED UP THE DWASHES CAS AD TWO BATTER
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,MINNI WILL CROUSE MORE THE LIGHTE AT HAS MORE THATRIS UP FOR
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,UH REPEATHAT AGAIN
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORNIY WRAPPED AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOW CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TUCOIT A DOESNT
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINE IS THE LINE TO SEOTHERN A MEIDG TENONES I ADN'T OA CET BEFORE IT WALL THAY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW IT JUST PICKED UP BY
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT IS TECUVVERS WHEN I PUT  THE WAIR WRAPPING MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT A MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,M THE IT'S ATTACHD TO THIRTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN IT PUT A HUNDRED WINS IT PICKED UFPF FIFTING WASHES BO BEFORE U IT ONLY PICKD UPLY PICTUHPTUN WASHERS INDSTEAD OF FIFTING WASHERS TO IT ADERNG UP AF FIE MORE
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,THE WIRES RAPED AROUND H A RIVVIT
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,UM AN IECREASE ONE O DO TH LL PICKS UP TOTHE LOWER CAUSE YO HNIE PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKT UP AT LHAE WAT UH UN A PUT IT'S TO A HUNDRED RANS AT LEAST PICK UP THIRTY WASH
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,WHAT IT RELATSES
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,UH WHAT'S IPOR HINE IS THERE'S ASTPALL TOBE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS H ELL IT HAS TO BE IT OF THIS CLO CARTO EVERYTHING
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TOWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE VEARE WOND CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES THATH GOES UP TO
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,HROUGH ACCOMPLISHED TAB B WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE VIT
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERENT NTO MAKE YOUR ELECTROMNEGATEVE STROI AVE ADMARE BATTERIES FASING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THE MARE U W DYOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPENNING OF THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING THMORE FORCE INTO IT
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT IT STAND ABOUT A METH GRAPF IS UM NUMBERES
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WELL HAVE BEENNMING THE OTHER AND ADDED ANNOTHER BAD
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,MIT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH ABASEN WATER AND ISASING WATERE
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DESCUVER IS THEA TUT MOVE NOW FLOWING THROUGH BY THA LIGHT BULB NOF AMOSHAING E REFRT
1189,NO,IY OT NEASE LTATSPRG
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT IS AT ELECTRICITY ISN'T SWUNG THROUGH BECAUSE N S TURNED AROUND  AD OTHER HAVE TO HAVE THA NEGATIVE AND TH POSIT TE CAOSE OF TH AND TOUCHEINS CHA AND OHAR TOO MAVE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
1191,UM IT WILL <unk> IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,UM IT WILL IT WILL THE LIGHT BULB JMSIONS RIGHT AND BROG EERN ND ERCH TO LIGHT TO THE LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS <unk> RIGHT,I DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT MEDUEST HAVE ONE THE ELECTRICITY W RUNOUT AND THEIRES SEINTING KINDE IT TO FORA PORLL A AN INSIDE IT SHOINS LIGHT
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,IT'S GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES O  CIRCUIT IS WHET WHEN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CASING WERE AND THE BASING WA
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,FOLLUGD BYES THE ECTISM THE REPEAT THAT AGAING
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEY'LL BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I ABSERVE IS WHEN YOU A JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TO LIGHT BULBS IT WILL FLITTL BE DOELL AND AROA SHIGPERIGHT BUT IF YOU HAD TWO BATTERIES IT 'WILL ONLY TWO LIGHT BULB SHAMBRITTER
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHARLLS MES THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ROUGH THE BATTERY THE R THE HTHE LIGHT BUL
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S IMPART END BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY REGOES THGH
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A CIRCUIT IS ELL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS ETHER THREE TWO OR ONES AH PATHWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING SIENTE IS LIRTING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,S I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT WILL IT WILL SHIGHT LOW WER AND THEWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRONT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT A BATTERY WTHTH BATTERY PUT THE
1203,OKAY,GREAY
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT <unk>,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT FOR BECU ET  THE LIGHT OR O
1205,FINISH,BINESTION
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,ATING H THE PEPER  HNOLEAR
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,I ITHE APAHASRU AAA IG TATS TO PIGARAN
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPEND IS TA WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE J CELL BATTERY AND IT WHAT BOTH OF THE WIRES HAS TO BE ON A BASING LAT AND ON A KASING WAR
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,WHEN WE ADMARBLBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEACKER
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ALSO ITGO LI IS CLARE BECAUSE OF BTE THEAR K
1211,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO,BECAUSE IT'S THATS THE COLERTS USED TO
1212,IT IT TURNS INTO THE,IT IT TURNS INTO HA BLUDER
1213,COLORS,COULERD SCICE
1214,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE THIT HAS RAD OR TIT'S BUSTVER RED
1215,UM CHANGING COLOR,UM UMIT'STANGING COLLER
1216,UM IT WILL TURN DARK,UM IT WILL TURN DARK
1217,CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS,ILETRINGS SOS THE TFILITER
1218,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,UM IT'S NIUE TO THE COULER CAUSE IT'S HAS GRA LIME AND IT'S JSTPI GREAN NOT RITER BLUE
1219,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,IT'S I THE PREISNON IS TRAGING IT CULER
1220,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,NOW IT LA HAV THE REFLECTION N OF EODIER HAT SNOW
1221,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR TO A PERSON
1222,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S ACECON BECAUSE THT SPRET REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COULLER AND IT'S IFFER BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING IND TO A INSTAD OF BLUE
1223,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIGHT KEEPS ON ASHING OFF OF OBJECT TROGH BOT THE COLLAR BLUE
1224,SEVEN SIX,SEVEN LOOKS
1225,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,BUT HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THINGST KIND OF CULLERS LIKE A TOR VILIT TO PRPAL TO BLU TO GRAIN TO YETAL TO ORNGE TO WRED
1226,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,SRIVE AN H RALL OVW
1227,THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR,THE REFLACTUR WBASSE TO IT TO MIXN THECOLLH
1228,TURNS INTO,ERE THCHIANCSE ANDE AONG
1229,UM STRUCTURE OF A LIGHT,U MAN OTHER WILS B STRUCTA  OF THE LIGTHE
1230,A RED,I DO'L KN KNOMEN THE RED
1231,UM IT'S REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE OR THE,YEAUM AT'S REFLECTING OFF AS A BLUE OR OF THE LOOXER
1232,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREAIN AND UM ORANGE BOBECAUSE YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT
1233,BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME COLOR,BCAUSE IT'S NOWTHE SAME COLLER
1234,TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,TURNING ITO SSOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
1235,YES THE REFLECTION THE COLOR,YES THE REFLECTIONAIT' THE COLEARN
1236,UM THE LIGHT LITTLE REFLECTS OFF THE LIGHT,WI   NS  THEUM AND SOMETHING OUSOF  AG TOF OURAVE
1237,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT RREFLECTS ALFF
1238,SIX COLOR,SOS LL
1239,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COULLERS REFLECTD OFF IN ITCH HINGES INT COLER
1240,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SOLITLES AND UM CIRCUITS AND THAY TISA
1241,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,WHAT HAPPENS AS IT TURNS DARK GRAN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIXS UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUB WHEN THE CARD IT'S WIGHT IT DOESN'T PIT TURE AN BLUE
1242,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT,THEY'R'LL HAVE LIGHT
1243,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,UN  UM ONE'S B CERE TXNITES UH NIGE WASHERS TO BREAKE ITS
1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,UM BY IT'SS FORCE
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FORCE WASN'T THE STRONG ENUG
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,WHAT IT DOESN'T UH MIXE UF FIRST A WEAKER
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS A JOS PAPER  OF THE PAPER CLIP ISOM TOP AND IT ROWS ITAROUT
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS BISIURD NESIPL TO HAVE THOT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S ALL OTO CONNECT
1249,THE MAGNET <unk> THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNET I THE MAGNET IS A HUM IT'S END ITS THEIKX STACK AND AND YOU'RE JOST MEED IND THE MAGNET AND THE METICAL HAS  MAGNET SYSTM CONNECTED TO
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN IT IS INTERED WHEN YOUWASH HER IT BROK ETS FALL BECAUSE OF THEBECAUSE OF THE SBACER
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE  IT THE SPASEIES MADE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAER
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I ABSORVBD APPEING IS LIKE ANNUTEMPERPREING THE WASHERS GO ING
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IF THE BIN BARALLY AD ONE SPASE WHER IT BREAKES ST FUL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETETISM ISN'T REALLY SOD TO STUCK ON
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,OR WHAT IT DOESN'T MAE T A MAGAT MAKES THE U AMOUNT TOLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EAVEN
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TO MAGNETS
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS AND ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGMAGNETS AND OTHEOTHER CUPS TOF SEE IT UM HOW MANY U WASHERS UT BREAK OF THE MAGNETS FALL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THER CODAY S TTHE MAGNET TOSUM OFE SOO IS FORE YSTORNO
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEY GETS FARTHER APART THE FIRSCT GFORCET COS THE WEKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNETS MAGNET TIS   FORCE OF THE WIRCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAGNS A WEAKER
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,THERE IS PRIGTTING APART
1260,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP UH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT CAIT GO UP TO THE IT BROKES UP ALL
1261,MAGNETISM,O MAGNECTISM
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WHITH GOING ON HERE FROM WHEN IT PRESSBEACERS WHEN IT AD THE THE MAGNE GETS TOLLER BUT THE MAGNET SYZE TV TOUCHING TOTHER
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,BECAUSE BIGER TIT GOES MALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES IT U MEAXS THE FORTH KIND OT WEAKER WE CAN T WURANTS SAARBING STRONGER AND USUALLY THE FORCEIDETEM
1265,I NEEDED THREE,I NEEDID THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,VR NOTICE IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE'S LIKE WHEN IT'SS JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MAGNET CAULL HOLD THE PAPER
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S SCEVERING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCTET BLOING BUT BY IT SELF IF YOU TACKE OFF THE MAGNET AND DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL AND IMEAN THAT KIND OF U TKIND OF UM MAGNET IN EMTHAT'S ALL I HAVE
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I SELL THOSVAANTS WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUBE SOMETHING METAL OR THA MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPER CLIP IT W'ILL STAY ON BECAUSE TV THE FORCE OF IT
1269,<unk> THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,I N'RW ACTOARS LIKE AT
1270,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL WITH THE THIN ONE  WAS LIKE ONE IKE GS THERE AND WN LY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'SEESE BECAUSE IT'S THICK AND THE AH WELL  WEL AND THEN I SOURT IN THIS EMEANTS FROWING LIKE THAT AND IKIND OF LIKE MANTT
1271,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT I'S GOING OUT THE THICK PESE PAPER IS THE FORCE O THA THE CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK A AND NETHING N I CAT BEGANS ITSSO
1272,BUT THE DIFFERENT <unk> PUSH BACK,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES IN WY THEY PUSH BACK
1273,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELLATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNETILL MIXTURE THROUGH AND R JUST REALLY REALLY NVERO LIKE IT DON'T WHAT THIS PLASE CLOS
1274,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,UM IT IS UP THAT THAT WITH THEAT SINE THINGS TOS
1275,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WE'VE LEARNED BOUT HOW MAGNET'S REACT UM HOW I CET THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET BCAUS IS SO UM IT O ALL STRONG THAT I CIC UT THRUGH NNEAIL AND NOTERIT C HOULD OF PAPER CALIPF
1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,THE MORTEOR CAN SEE ABOUT THAT IS IT'S TT ANY TEINTO MAGNETS ON IT REACTS LIKE
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISNT IT ACTING LIKE A MAGUH LIKE WERE A WIREY CURAPPET AROUND ELECTRICIT AND CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH AND STIL MAKE IT'STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL OND REACTS LIKE A METAL
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,HEN IT'S A MAGNET ON IT STICK TO THE PAPERCLUBP BUT WHEN IT DES NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPER CUL
1279,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,MATO U S HTHE MOGOVR IS HOLDER TO ATRCO TAN NAV
1280,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETTISM
1281,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH THBUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CANGOLED THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PETEGRAV A UM PAPER CLIP WHAT THAT'S FO
1282,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST SE THE SAMETHING ERASURDY YOU LASED IME
1283,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,UM RE OURE YOU  PBTUOWING ME AND MOVY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THET NAIL ON THE PAPERCLIPS
1284,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WATALR OAN IS IT STUCKIND TO A NIL AND IT'SCONNECTO PAPER DAY
1285,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN  SEE THE SAME PICTURE
1286,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,ONE SEE THE MAGNET DROPALH UNDER THIS PAPULL AND AND THE MAGNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET IS CONNECTING T AND HOPILE J
1287,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,MOTAR'S HAPPENING I THE FORCE IT BECAUSE STIN'T GO THROUGH WID BECAUSE THE MAGNET SFORCE IS SO LIKEIT'S A STRONG
1288,REPEAT THAT,REPEATTHATERGANSLINE
1289,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS RER FROM THE NAIL AND S THE NAILL EES IT'S MAGNETTIS
1290,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP<unk>,WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IS A METAL AND A PECS OF PAPER CLIP
1291,LEARNNG ABOUT MAGNETISM,I'M NOT VORY
1292,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CILLP CAN NOT REPELL EACH OTHER
1293,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,I SEE IT'S A MAGNET AND A NAIL AND IT'S FORCE KEEP ON GOING ONTO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
1294,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD <unk> PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD UM PAPERCLLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
1295,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK AT IS SHOING US IS THE FFORCE OF THE MAGNETIS
1296,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPENING IS THE MAGNETISM PIRSSES OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S OF MAGNETIS MAGNEE
1297,THE <unk> FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLED IT TOGETHER N MOTOR MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
1298,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNETGET AND FORT
1299,THE LIGHT BULBS ALL OF THEIR ELECTRICITY AND,EAT LIGHT BULBS ARE ALL A BELECTTRICITY AND
1300,OKAY,LOOKAY
1301,A D CELL BATTERIES AND,A D CHELL BATTERIES OF TIN
1302,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELP LIGHT IT UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY TO COT
1303,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I E AND THIS PICTURE IS LOTS OF THE ELECTRICITY GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND LIKE THE LIGHT BULB
1304,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,IDIFFERENT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIZSER OR THE BACE BULBD AT WIGTER REALLY WERG BECAUSE LASTIC IS COOLD
1305,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY AR THEY D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHTB
1306,BUT I NOTICE IS SOME IMPORTANT THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT,WHAT I OICED IS SO  SURONM PARTS THEYR ARE LIACS CONNECTE
1307,THE ELECTRICITY FLOW,ELECTRICITY
1308,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,WHERE THE DIRECTION THE FLOW WHEN IT IH SWITCH THE D CELL I IT CHANGES TO THE NEGATERVE SIDE AND EPOSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTON
1309,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING ADD OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SID
1310,WITH THE AT THE SAME WIRE AND YOU,IF THE THINGS TURNS EAT ATTE ORK BECAUSE IT'S BOTH AT THE SAME IA AND YOU LOW
1311,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHEN IT WHAT EVER SAID YOU JUST SWITCH IT TO ITS I LIKES THE SAME THING
1312,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHATER WIRE DOESN'T A CIRCUIT IS HELPES MAKE  ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
1313,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WHT ONE WIRE IS HITTING THROUGH THE PSION IS SENDING TO THE BA SB
1314,WIRES IN IT CIRCUIT CARRY,WIRES IN A CIRCUIT CARRIE

1317,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY IF BATTERY GIVING IT IT'S,ELECTRICITY FLOWS Y THE BATTERY GIVING ITS IT'S ENERGY TO PUSHERE BYE THER
1318,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,WHAT I NOTICED THAT I DIOD THEYR I THE LIGHT BULB A LIGHET IT ENTS ORDERD TO LIGHT OF THE GHT TTHE ENERGY
1319,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,SO AN IA NOTICED AFWOUT THE SUITIUT AN AUS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH  E FLGHE WIRES IN TO THE LIGHT BU
1320,WHERE IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE D CELL <unk> WIRES,AND WHERE THE ELECTRICITY MOS AA THE D CELL IDS M  THE WIRES

1322,ELECTRICITY,THE BLUE DOTS RONS ANLECTRICIT
1323,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO MEAS A CIRCUIT GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE LIGE IT WITH THE ELECTRICITY
1324,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SIENCE UM
1325,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE A AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1326,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
1327,WHEN YOU PUT THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING TO,WHEN YOU FLIPTD SCELL INSTEAD OF GOING APIP
1328,ON THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH,U ENERGY IS GOING THRU
1329,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATTERY HELPS WITH THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP LIGHT IT ON AND SREALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
1330,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S IMPORTANT SO THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK CU GO THROUGH THE FROUG BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WAY BACK IT WOLN'T BE ABLE TOU GETS TRIP TO GET THE MAGNET
1331,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THE CIRCUIT IT'S BIMPORTANG ABAT CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
1332,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,THE Y OF THE ROVEET OF THE WIRE IS RAPED AROUND THE TOP FROUM BECAUSE THAT'S FOR THE UM ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CUCK OUT THE
1333,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,IT HAS SOME MAGNET ACONNECT A A KOD ON TO PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S WIRY
1334,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,M THE ELECTRICITY STORS GOES THROUGH THE MAGNET AN CORCE OF THE FORE  ARAIC CONNECTIOVITY T WTH ALL THE WASHES CONNECT AND THE GOES THROUG THEUH POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE S
1335,WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT,WE LEARNT ABOUT H H HALT IREL  ICUIT AN  UM THE CLOSECIRCUIT AFFECTED AND I NON'T WEIGHT
1336,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BECAUSE IT'SIREN OR STEEL SHO THE MAGAET TO SUBMIT STRONG ENOUGF FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUN AND AND ONTO IT TO MAKE A EMINENT TO GET THE MAGNETIC ORS
1337,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTO THE WAROR IS  UM CLOSE
1338,SMALL,OPS
1339,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WELL THE CIRCIT OF THE SWITCH ALS  SOMETHING T HAS TO BE PLUGED UT OF A MAGNEGNEIT FORCE CELL THE  ELECTRICITY CVELTS COUH THRUGH SOMPTING THROUGH ANOTHER WATER
1340,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,AS UR HABEING WOITH THE RIVER AND THE WIRES  SUM I HAS TO AT THESED CONNECT E TOER AT LEEST DO SOMETHING OFOI
1341,A RIVET,A ROVIT
1342,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN THE CIRCUIT THE  WSHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THEOF THE METAL THING D AND WHEN IT'S CLOS CIRCUIT IT STICK
1343,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKE ME THINK THAR IS BECAUSE THE WIRE  ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT  TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAXITVE IT THE MAGNETTIC COURC
1344,SCIENCE,SCIEANCE
1345,WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS IN,WHAT THAT RELAGTES HYSTERICH S AIT AND

1445,THINGS THAT STICK MAGNET OR EITHER METAL AND ONCE USUALLY PACKED PLASTIC,THINGS THAT'S SICK TO MAGNET ARE EATHER E UMETAL AND THE ONES ARE USUALLY PRACT  PLASTIC GROUGH WITH
1446,BECAUSE THEY DID PROJECT,BECAUSE THEY DID A PROGJEC
1447,THAT IS CALLED MAGNETISM,THAT IS CALLD MAGNETTISM
1448,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE IS,GO
1449,<unk> PAPER CLIP <unk> AND YES THAT IS,PAPERCLIP FO AND ASTIT
1450,YES,YES
1451,THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK,THE PAPER FESSINER STAYS ON AND THE STEL AL AND THE BLACK ROV
1452,I THINK IT'S ALUMINUM,I THINK IT'S A LUMINUM
1453,<unk> WELL IT BECAUSE ITS STILL LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE IS NOT ELECTRICITY TO GO RUN THROUGH EACH <unk>,LIGHT BECAUSE IT'S TO LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE'S NOT OUT ELECTRICITY ON TO GO RNING THROUGH EACH
1454,IT GOES <unk> THROUGH HOW THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONE GOES BACK INTO IT,UM IT GOES THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATAVE LIME GOES BACK INTO IT
1455,<unk> THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS <unk> THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,I THINK WHAT HAPPANS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
1456,<unk> WHAT THE HAVE THEY COMPARED IS SETUP DIFFERENTLY STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY,I WONTHE HOW THEY COMPARE IS THEY'RE SENT UP DIFFERENT WAYGS BUT STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY
1457,GREAT,GOREAT
1458,<unk> CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,UH CDOG REPEAT THAT AGAIN FER
1459,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP,WHAT'S GOING ON IS UM THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS IND OTER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP
1460,I THINK <unk> I GUESS THE WHY I AM THE MADE CHOICES,I THINK I GES THE BOUTTME AND HEWAHR MA THOICES BUT
1461,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND FOR HAPPENS IS RUNNING CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT HELP TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,BECAUSE WE DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON IT AND I HAPPEING INSPERING OIT'S A BATTERYY A HEALP WITH OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT LIGHT
1462,WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT BULBS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH HIM AND RELATED IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE LIKE,WHAT I ABSEURVE ABOUT THE BULBS AND IS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGHM AND IT REALLY SES IT AND IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO THE LIGHT
1463,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO HENE ELECTRICITY HAS SAP GO SAP GOS BUT IN A PARALL CIRCUIT FGOES AGROUND AND MAKETHE OD AND ATE
1464,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASBE THEERE IS FORE AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT WELL THERE IS ONLY SUPOUSETO BE ONE
1465,WHAT'S GOING ON IT GONE OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH <unk> BUT STILL USING THE SAME THING BUT NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND BY THE,WHAT'S GOING ON IND IT'S GOING OUT THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BUT STILL USE N THE SALRTHING BUT THEY EED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND OTER TO LIGHT OUF
1466,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE
1467,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,WHAT I NOTICED THA TATHRING IASTHE ENERGY PO DIFFERENT XSO
1468,<unk> WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WIL WHIT'S BEST ONE NOW IGES IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ASET AN ENERGY
1469,<unk> THE <unk> THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE <unk> BECAUSE THE <unk> CONNECTED RIGHT,AH UM THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP BECAUSE THE RAGHT S GOING AUSE ACONNECTEOD THE RIGHT
1470,WHAT I OBSERVE THE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS <unk> THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY <unk>AND GOING TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS <unk>,WHAT I ABSERVE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THE ENERGY S GOING TO ITH THE BATTERY AN GOING TO BOFTH THE LIGHT BULBS
1471,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,WHAT I NOTICED THERSN'T ANERGIG WHAIT'S GOING  AND BATTERYNG IT'S GOING INTO THE BATTERY
1472,<unk> THE THE BATTERY REALLY ELECTRICITY,THE END OF THE BATTER AR ELECTRICITY
1473,WHAT I THINK WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO CUPPLLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS IT' AL LIGHT BROAIGTER AND BROITER
1474,I THINK THIS IS THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
1475,IF THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS,THE KINDS OF CIRCUITS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ITS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
1476,<unk> THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE <unk> THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,UM THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS ARE THEY LIGHTS UP IT BURNTS OUT AND YO HAV TO REPLECTE WIT ANOTHER ONE
1477,IT IS FLOWING <unk> INTO THE POSSTIVE SIDE,IT IS FLOWING INTO THE POSITOR SIDE
1478,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T NOT <unk> LIGHTING WERE AND WHAT NOW ITS LIGHTING SO BRIGHT <unk> BECAUSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE,WHAT I NOTICED  THE LIGHT BULB IS IN LIGHTING WHELL WHEN WELL NOW IT'S LIGHTING IS SO BRIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPASIT SIDE
1479,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB WHEN BACK OUT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB BACK UP,IT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IT'S GOING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT THROGH LIGHT ROB DORAT
1480,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE 'S MORE CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE MORE
1481,THAT ONE REMEMBER DIRECTION,WATER REMEMBER IT SALLS IT HAS TO BE A CURRENT AND A DIRECTION
1482,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,VVBEEN LEARNING IN CIENTCE UM PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERE CIRCUIT
1483,I THINK THE CIRCUIT ONE TOP <unk> BECAUSE <unk> THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND AN XC BUT LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY BRIGHT,I THINK THE SECOND ONE IT TOP BECAUSE  THERE'S A LIGHT BULB AND EX SEE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS ARE SHINING  REALLY BRIGHT
1484,OH WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES THE MORE ENERGY SOME MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU CAN LIGHT UP THERE IS ENOUGH NOT YOU ELECTRICITY FOR,WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BETTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY THE MORE LIGHT BULB SYOU LIGHT UP THERE'S NOT ENOUF JE OR AN EAER ELECTRICITY FOR IT

1884,YEAH UM WE LIKE HOW WE MADE IT WE TOOK UM FISHING LINE THE REALLY STRONG STUFF AND UM WE DUCT TAPED IT TO A CHAIR OF FOUR METERS AND THEN WE TAPED IT TO ANOTHER CHAIR AND THEN WE ATTACHED OUR PLANE UM TO THE FISHING LINE AND UM OUR PLANE IS MADE OUT OF STRAWS LIKE DRINKING STRAWS UM AND RUBBER BANDS AND UH POPSICLE STICKS AND WHEN WE WIND IT UP UM MY GROUP ENDE MY GROUP AND I WE GOT SIXTY AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY LIKE IT GOES BY ITSELF WITHOUT US T T TOUCHING IT OTHER THAN WINDING IT AND THE IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CHAIR,YEAH UM WE LIKE HOW WE MADED IT WE TUCK UM FISHING LINE THERRALLY STRONG STUFF AND UM WE TOCK TAPED IT TO A CHARE OF FOR METERS AND THEN WE TAPED IT TO ANOTHER CHARE AND THEN WE ATTACH  OUR PLAINE UM TO THE FISHING LINE AND UM OUR PLANE IS MADE OUT OF STRAWS LIKE DRINKING STRAWS UM AND REVERBANDS AND POP SCLE STICKS AND WHEN WE WINED IT UP UM MY GROUP MAND  MY GROUP AND BY W GOT SIXTY AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY LIKE IT GOES BY IT SELF WITHOUT US TOUCHTOUH TOUCHING IT OTHER THAN INDING IT AND THE IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THEE THITRCHARE
1885,LIKE WE WE HAD TO DO WE HA WE GUESSED LIKE FOR MAYBE IF YOU HAVE FIFTEEN AND THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE IT JUST STAYED IN IT'S PLACE SO ONE REALLY BIG VARIABLE IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER FOR THE PLANE,LIKE WE WE HAD TO DO WE A WE GESS LIKE FOR WHEN WE HAVE FIFTEN AND THAT DIDN'T GO ANY WERE IT JUST STAYED IN IT'S PLANE SO ONE REALLY BIG VARIABLE IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER FOR THE PLANE
1886,TO IF EVERYONE WAS DOING LIKE THE SAME VARIABLE IT WOULD TAKE A LONGER TIME TO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF EVERYBODY DID THE SAME VARIABLE AND THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES SO I GUESS IT'S UH,TILL IF EVERY ONE WIS DOING LIKE THE SAME VARIABLE IT WOULD TAKE A LONGR TIME TO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF EVERY BUDY DID THE SAME VARIABLE AND THERES SOW MANY VARIABLES SO I GUESS HNOTHINGS ON
1887,THEN WE WIND IT UP AND WE TEST ALL OF OUR VARIABLES,THEN WE WINED IT UP AND WEA JUST
1888,CAUSE THAT WILL EVERYBODY WANTS A DIFFERENT ANSWER,CAUSE THAT WILL EVERY BUDY WONTS A DIFFERENT ANSER
1889,YEAH WE GET FISHING LINE AND WE DECK LIKE WE GET A PIECE OF DUCT TAPE AND WE LIKE PUT IT RIGHT HERE AND IT'S LIKE UM IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE CHAIRS TOGETHER IT SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE VERY SPREAD APART SO IT'S LIKE REALLY TIGHT AND THEN WE PUT OUR PLANE ON RIGHT UM RIGHT BEFORE WE PUT ON THE DUCT TAPE AND WE UM,YEA WE HM GET FISHING LIME AND W DO LIKE WE GET IT IF WE SAD DUCK TAPE OR E LIKE PUT IT RIGHT THR AND IT'S IT UM IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE CHARYS TOGETHER IT SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE VERY SFAR TA PART SO IT' LIKE REALLY TIGPE AND THEN WE PUT OUR PLAN ON RIGHT  RIGHT BEFOUR WE PUT ON THE DOUCK TAPEAND WE UM
1890,LIKE,LIKE
1891,LIKE IF EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME ANSWER IT MIGHT'VE TAKEN A LONGER TIME TO TEST OUT THIS EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF EVERY BUDY GOT THE SAME ANSER IT MIGHT AVFE TAKEN LONG OR TIME TAT TESED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT
1892,UH MMM CAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO ONE AT A TIME MMM A CA AND UH EACH TABLE GROUP IS A DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KINDA COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY THAT,U  CAUSE I THINK WERE GON UN DOIN'G HEN ID A TIME  H AND UH EACH TABLEGROUP IS N DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KIND OF CUVERE'S IT I GES WE COULD SHROWAA
1893,WELL IF YOU LIKE DO IT I GUESS IF YOU KIND OF TODAY UH WE'RE GONNA DO IT OUTSIDE UM,WELL IF YOU LIKHT DO IT I GESS IF YOU KIND OF TODAY UN WORKOR AND DO IT OUT SIDEUM
1894,YEAH YEAH MMM HMM I KNOW,YEAH YEAH MMI NKNOW
1895,UM LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN,UM LIKE WADNTN WE
1896,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHAIRS AND DUCT TAPED EM AND OUR WE WINED UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WAIT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASS ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOT IN FISH LIAND CHARES AND DECK TAPE DUM AND ARE WE WIND UP THE PLAN WITH THE PRPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND CELL YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLS BUT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOP THE FORCE THE MASS ON HAWF S THE PLAN GOES
1897,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN,AH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HAF WAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNDTILL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN RIGHT IT DOWN
1898,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO AT THE TOP OF THE POD AND THEN ARE GONNA GO DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF GOING DOWN LIKE UM MAYBE LIKE IN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING IS AT,YEAH UM SOME PEOPL ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOP UM SOMEPEOPLE DG AT THE TOP OF THE PN AND THAND HEIRE GONG TO GOES DOWN STUAD THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHARES WILL B AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY APINION I DON'T THINK THAT U IT WILL GO TE FARE IF IT'S GOING UP AND I THINK THUT A HAUH A VERY WELL CHANCS OF COM DOWN LIKE UM MABE LIKE AN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT WILL PROBABLY GO DOWNTO THE OTHER CHARE CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING S THAT
1899,N MMM AS LONG IT'S AS LONG A IT'S THE STRING IS TIGHT AND THE PLANE IS ON MMM HMM,MMM AS LONG IT'S AS LOUNG A ITSTHE STRING IS TIGY AND THA PLATE IS ITE THE PLAN OF HM MU
1900,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE A TWENTY MAYBE LIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP,WEOREXSPECTING IT TO UMAKE LIKE MAYBE AND TWENTY MAYBE LIKE AND TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCS THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT WILL HELP
1901,BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP,UH I I ASK MN LIKE WHERE IT'S SAIT UP
1902,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,WELL UM THE SYSTKIND OF HAVE SHE TOLD US TSNA
1903,YEAH,YEAH
1904,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HAF WAY FOR THE PLANE ANSO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FARE IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINCES THE PROPELLER GO FOUR ALL THE WAY
1905,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HAFF WAY AND ALL THE WAY AND DIMSOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STARCH IT TO FAR THE PLAN GOS LIKE SWASING INTO THE ATEARCHARE THE ROP GOS DOWN AND LIKE CLFSWITH
1906,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT WILT PROBABABLY HAVE TO DOBBLE IT IF IT WAS LUERLIKE UM T WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT AR IR PLAND ALL THE WAY OND FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GESS IF IT WAS LU SEUR WE MIGHT AV HAD TO SPIN WORE
1907,SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE,SOUY UH S ING  U I GESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSERS FOR EACH ONE
1908,YEAH,YEAH
1909,WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY THOUGH,WORKN AN DO THAT S DAY
1910,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAD IF THAT WAS GOING ONE TO THREEY AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MY SELF THAN UM I MAY HAVE MIS COUNTED ONE AND THAT WAND MISS UP THE HOLE I PAPER AIDE
1911,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,WELL UH WE ARE CHUSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM IS MOJO BROGHT IN LIKE MINNY FANS AND WE'RE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO INY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER
1912,A SANDWICH,A SAM WICH
1913,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WELL LIKE MY UM THE IKER P RIGHT AND FROUN AND WE THEY DID UM THREE WMAE THEY DID ONE SUNDY METER AS A BOUT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN TWERE COPARING TH
1914,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE AOFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES AR TEACHER SAI THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PART ANER AN IN DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP HUM AND FIVE INCHES AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS THEN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HIGHT IS UM WHEN YOURE HIGHE IS LONGER I GESS HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN AN THE ONE I WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TWO SIXSETS FULLYEAH YH
1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL THEOF THE HIGHTES UM WE IT FOR SOM RESEAN AERE JUST CEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY NOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO TO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDO OF MASES LIKE QORNOR CORNOR CORNOR CORD AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IN THE MITL AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREEY SCENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AND THE FFIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT OULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TIGY TAIN WERE YOU NOW IN THE TIYY TANNIC THE THE LIFE BOATS ARE HUDE THEY THEY CAUD HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBEY THAN A REGULAER CROUSE BUT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CROUS CHIP
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY I GOES TO THE SIDE AND WY THE PENNY USED JUT TALL H SOLAIT WE POR TRYE TO PUT IN THE METAL BUT THEN THE L IT GO TO THE SIDE
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS ATER
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,FEL LIKE A SOUPER STAR H LIK ALREADY NO THAT NOVING IVNING
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEWO PENNES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS LESS OF A CHANS TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASH PENNES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL ECQUALLY AN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL AND THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
1922,YEAH,NO
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,UM WEILL AURE CIMEANES I DON'T PARTICULLAR LY NOW HIT'S NAME BUT WERE KIND OF UH QUESTING UM HOW H FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOUT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HIGHT WHAT EVER IS ON THE BOUT AND HAOW LIGHT WILL FLOWT OR HOW IT WILL SINK
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,H HUM AND THEN WE HAD TO PORE THAT OUT AND OUR BIN IT'SL OT BIGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HER AND WEWY GOT LIKE FIFTY THREEY BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HER AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREY SO TWO FIFTY ES IN THREY AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREY
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OI UM WELL WEIGHT SO HOW I MAND THE LIFE BO AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO W GOT A HOW I MEAD THE LIFE BOUT WAS WE CICK THE COFFY CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HI AND WE TUCK A PEN SHARPBLY WHAT EVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE PLACED THE PENNES WHER EVER WE WANT ED TO AND THEN OR PART NERINI U THOUGT THAT IF WE PUT ALL AT UH ONE SIDE IT WAS GOTN THE SINK EVEEN FASTER SO
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,UM W DED UM HOW BOTS FLO
1927,THE HEIGHT,THE HIGHT
1928,MAYBE,MAY BE
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LEVFET CUP BOT CAN HOLD
1930,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE
1931,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,WELL WE WE JUST PLASED THE PENNY IS IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS
1932,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CROU FILLT MYME LIKE LIKFE BOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FIRST SOM REEASAN IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT GRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASAN WEN'S OUT AF GAS ARE I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNES THEY WOULD BE REALL PASENGERS AND THETHE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE IKE AALLIEN TIMES BIGGER SO
1933,YEAH,YEH
1934,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YE HAV THE FOR THE THREEY UH WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HEAR FOR THE FIVE WAY TO PUT IT UP HEAIR BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARDEARK GUN  ALREADY UH WHEN WE HAD THE SQORDERK GUN IWE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO ATS LIKE DOWN HERE ANDOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THEE S DOWN HERE AND DOWN HEAR AND SO WE TCKT IT ALL WEND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TO
1935,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREE CENTIMETERS,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREY SCENTIMETERS
1936,FIFTY S A HUNDRED AND THREE AND FIFTY SIX,FIFTY SERE A HUNDRED LENTHES IH AND FIFTY SEXND
1937,AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY,AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY
1938,THAT LIKE THE,THAT LIKE THEO
1939,ONE MORE TIME,THE MORE DIO
1940,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THEN THE ONES THAT JUST TAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED SING TO THE SIDE AND
1941,IS THIS THING ON RIGHT,IT IS BENG ONA
1942,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,O UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCES THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNY S WHERE YOU AN TO PLASE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT IS PIG SARDA
1943,FIVE INCHES,FIVE INCHIES
1944,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING THIT CAN HAR MIY SELF INA
1945,I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER,I GES THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER
1946,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT,WELL IV EVERY BUDY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE HOL ANTIR CUP SO UM EVERY BUDY JUST DID THEIR OWN HIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT UFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME POPLE GOT
1947,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT IS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I M GESS WELL   WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIS AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNYS
1948,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MMM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBE TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MAND THEN WE SICKD IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN U LIKE TES TOUBES TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREY MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OR THIREY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK
1949,W WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THAT MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE,WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRYED E MI PARTNER AD I ALSO TRYED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNES IN BEFOR PLAING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KIND OFT DID LIKE MAY BEY UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLAED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOTED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIE TO PLACE IT IN THE BOT AND IT STARTED IT TAILL A LITTLE
1950,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UH ONE TO FIVE INCHES THAT YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND,UM WELL IN CLSS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFY CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WERE DOING UH ONE FIVE INCHES  YOU CAN YOU HADE TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW ANY PASENGERS CAN FIT IN T AND PASENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNES AND YOU DROP A MINET AND THE ONES HIT INGKS THAT'S THE METER OF PASENGERS AND
1951,WE THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TWO Y WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND,WEI THIS IS KIND OF O TALFICK BUT JUST IK PLINEA YOU NOW NASINAL TREASUR TOW WHEN THEY'RE HAVE TO LEAVEL OUT THEY'R UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BORD THEY HAVE TO LEAVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT MEAND LIGHT PARTNER DID S YOU CAN GET THAT IN UR MIND
1952,UH OF THE CUP OF THE COFFEE UH HUH AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUB OF WATER EACH UH PERSON GOT WITH YOUR PARTNER AND SO WE GOT A CUP OF PENNIES AND WE JUST INDIVIDUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIFE BOAT CUP AND UM SO THEN WE BASICALLY JUST DROPPED EM IN AND MY PARTNER'S KINDA WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINK THAT'S BECAUSE MORE OF THE MASS WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDE SO THAT IT WAS SINKING MORE SO IF WE WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY PENNIES IT WOULD EVEN IT OUT WELL IT DID AND THEN WE KEPT PUTTING MORE LIKE IN THE CENTER HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE KNEW THAT THAT LAST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS UM THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LIFEBOAT,OF THE CUP OF THE CUP HUH AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUPB OF WATER EACH THEH PERSON GOT PITHER PART NER AND SO WE GOT A CUP OF PENNS AND WE JUST INDEVIDGUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIGFE BOT CUP AND UM SO THEN WE BASCICALLY JUST JROPED A MIN AND MY PART NER ASINED KIND N WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINK THUS BECAUSE MORE OF THE MASS WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDE SO D IT WAS INKING MORE SO IF WE WE THOGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WITH THERE WASN'T ANY PENNES IT WAN EIVEN AN OUT WELL HIT DID AND THEN WE CEP PUTING MORE LIKE IN THE SENTER HER HERE HERE HER HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE NOU THAT THAT LAST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS UM THERE WAS SPOSE TO BE AN THE LIFHET BOT HM
1953,UM WELL W THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT AND THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE,UM WELL THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HIGHT AND THE MASS THOSE WORT OF THE ONLY VARY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE
1954,WELL UM WE W FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER WAIT NO EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST,WELL UM WE W FIRST OF ALL EVERY BUDY DID A THIRTY AIGT SEND METER WE NOW EVERY BUDY DID THREY SCENIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEN CUT OFF THE REST
1955,WELL I THINK THIS ONE CAN HOLD MORE WATER,WELL I THINK THE SUN CAN HOLD MORE WATER
1956,E I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO,I I THINK I DIDN'T RONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO DOWN HER SO
1957,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECI WELL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PENDULUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND IT W AND WHAT WE UH FOUND OUT IS W NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXSPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PINOLLUM AND WE DO SIGHE WEL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PEG LUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HEAR AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVLES AND IT AND WHAT WE UH FOUND OUT IS  NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE PASISTION OF YOUR PENDRILLUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS AND FIFTEN SECANDS
1958,YES EVEN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE HUNDRED THE NINETY FIVE THE ME,YES EVEN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEN THE HUNDRED THE NINDY FIVE THE  MIN
1959,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGEES THE HOLL PROSCESE SO UM IT PUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENSULLUM DOES NOT MATTER
1960,YEAH,YEAH
1961,MMM HMM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER E WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE,WELL FOR THE THIRTY AIGHT UM EVERY BUDY GOT THE SAME NUMBER WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERY BUDY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLE STARTED TO CHANGE
1962,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YOU WI YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERY BUDY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FINE YORS SO FOR MINE
1963,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHITE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO BY ONE BY ONE UM WITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOF OUR WIGHT BORD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ON TO THREY FORE FIVE ALL THE WAY T TWENTY FIVE AND THEN POPLE JUST TARTED TO GO ONE BY ONE UM WHATH THE WITH THE PENDRILLMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHTE HEAR
1964,ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAPH LIKE THIS,ALL THERE UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAFF LIKE THIS
1965,YEAH UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN M UH WE DECIDED TO USE ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO,YEAH UM EVERY BUDY USED THIRTY AIGHT AND THEN UH WE DESIDED UH TO USE ONE OFRH STRADITIES AS IF EVERY BUDY GOT AT DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DIT IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TOWO
1966,THIRTY EIGHT,THIRTY AYH
1967,YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET SEVENTEEN,WI WUD PROLBG ETS SEVENTEEN
1968,YEAH,E HAH
1969,WELL W WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON A STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY UH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIOUS OF TIMES,WE WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY INCH UM PENJULLUMS OND STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY UH AND TOEVERY BUODY JUSTDID AT THEIR OWN HIGHT AND EVERY BUODY UNTIDT UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIET OF TIMES
1970,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO  EVERY BUDY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAIVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEME TO CHANGE

2008,YEAH,YEAH
2009,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,UM M WE HAD TO DO  RY UM WE HAD T SWE HAD TO DO FORE DIFFERENT SDAYGES I GESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WI WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLEPS ON SIX SENTIMETERS VERY CLOE TO THE KIND OF SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THAT WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FORE AND THEN WE DID THREEY AND THEN WE DID TO AND UM
2010,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,UM WE TUCK OFF FLUPPER UM LIKE UM LIKE LIKE AN LDAN DAYS N  HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CANNINPULL FORIT LIKE WORES AND WHAT NOT AND UM WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WERE FLINGING UP  MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THEIRE
2011,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINTED TO TWO VARIABLES BUTD IT'S COMING TOGETHER AIS ONE SO WORKING HOW FARE INOR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BULL
2012,CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET YOUR RESULT,CAUSE THAT'S ONLY WAKING IT OREISULHT
2013,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WE YES WE WELL UH MIY TEACHER JUST WANES THE TO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS IXSPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY SCENNIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY UT IGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOUT GO AS GO AS HY AND THE VARIABL WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FARE THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT
2014,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE UM OURE FUSTICK IS THE POPSTICAL STICK AND THERES SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTILL THESE TWO COM INSOT'S LIKE ONE TO THREY FOR FIVE SICX
2015,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSER AS A RESULTS SO THEN YOUWULD GET SEVEN TEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN T THIRTTEN ONE TO THIRTY FOR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE
2016,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,UM LIKE HOW IT WE SIT IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOS UP TO SICX SEIMETERS A POP SCICALE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IN IN AS FARE AS TE U  LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALLUMINUM FOIL AND WERE  WHERE KIND OF CRUSHING IT INTO A BULL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEIVE IT LIKE ON THE PECE WITHOUT CPULING IT INTO A BULL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERY BUDY SPUNNING UP AND TO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOMEPEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FHAR THE BULL GOES AND SOMEPOPLE ARE DOING HOW HYH THEBULB GOS AND SOME PEOPLE DOING HOW FARE THE STICK IIS AND AND SOME POPL ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW I RALY SAY THA HOW HY IT GOES SOW I UM UM
2017,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,HUH THE FLUPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLUPPER AND UM UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WHENT ABOUT THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SENTIMETERS WHICH IS A LIMET OF A MEASURING UM KIND OF TAE MEASURING TAPE
2018,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND UM SO WE UM OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOWTH FU THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR DOUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FARE IT IS OUT CANNING T THATH THE MORE FARGS OUT AIR
2019,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD AD THATWS ALL TOGETHER SO UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSER SO ONE TEVN Y FIVE PLUSS ONE THIRTY PUS ONE FIFTEEN PUSS ONE SEVEN TEEN WIT
2020,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH YUE DSIED HOW ORGON TO DO IT AND UM WHAT EVER YOU DIVIDED BY FORE I  I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE CSHEUWLELE TO SEE S COLCULATERS SO ATER THE DESIMALLE ON THE COWCULATER THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR RESULTSWO WRE COMEN MIXING MATHINTO THISS
2021,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEPELE ARE TESTING HOW FARE THE ALUMINUM BULBGOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR AND DISTENTSUM I GESS I T WEILL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURNOB BUT THIS ITURNOU
2022,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,UM WHELL MY GROUP AND IY TOCK A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIABULL AND WE PLASSED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLASED IT UM LUIM BOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TUCK ANNOTHER POP STCAL STICK AUSE IF WE DIDN'T WITH THOUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECTD IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIY OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USED OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSTICAL STICK
2023,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FORE TIMES AND THEN WE DIVITED IT BY FOR CAUSE WE DIDN'T FOR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS
2024,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,SO LETSO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLCKED IT AND THE PERSON HO DID IT IT WILL ENE OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEYWULD GO IT CLOSE TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVNDY FIVE AND HN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE
2025,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,H WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIY THE THEM UHM LUMINTUMFALL GOS UP LIKE THOSE GRALS OVER THERE THERE IS A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UPPAND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE THAT'S WHIYE THAT'S HOW HY WE HAVE TO GORH THAT'S AR LIKE GES SO I

2431,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIRE OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS ITE BELLEAFE
2432,GOOD,GOOD
2433,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THIRE IF THERE 'S ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK
2434,NOT YET,NOT YET
2435,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GONG TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THER'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE IS TWO OTHERES TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ONE TO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY
2436,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO FLOW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO THROW FROM HER TO THE OTHER ONE
2437,MABE I'M NOT REALLY SURE,MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
2438,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WEAIGHTYEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATH WAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOK OUT THE LEFT T LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT WIN WOULD STILL BE GOING ON
2439,THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON,THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE IS ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OFF A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON
2440,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER T IN A MOTH
2441,UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH,UM WHEN ONE BULB BULBS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THE'RE STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY DOTH FLOW THROUGH
2442,WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH,WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIYHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY ONDE GO THROUGH
2443,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THING'S THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB,UM I THINK IT TELLS MY THAT THE METTALE THINGS THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE METAL THE THINGS THAT ARE SUROUNDING ITARE THE WIRES IND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN ITS ARE THE LIGHT BULB
2444,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSETHERE'S NOT ANY AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN TH WIRE MAY BE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THEN JUST A STRAIGHT UM SO IF WE CLIPE WIRE
2445,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS THE SAME UM AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS UM THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY
2446,YES,YES
2447,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINS IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOME HOW BY THE LIGHT BULB
2448,YES,YES
2449,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KINDA THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A SURTN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUH THE KIND OF THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WER IT MAKES IT HARD FROM THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTSOUPS

2468,AT THE UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM,AT UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FOR RTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THIS SHOULD BE A LITTL SOUARLY THINK WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE OCKETS YOU PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THEARE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM
2469,IT FLIPS IT AROUND,IT FLIPS IT AROUND
2470,BYE,B
2471,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER END
2472,IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM DANGIT I JUST FOR,IT CONNECTS TWO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM THING I JUST
2473,GOOD,GET
2474,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KINDA THING AND YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO,W YOUD HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWERALLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KIND OF THING AND YOUD HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO
2475,THEY ARE I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THOUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE V FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH,THEY ARE IN THAT IS UPOSED TO HELP IT COME THROUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THEERE IT WOULD BE FAIRALLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY  COME THROUGH
2476,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,WE I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND IT DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKE WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE WETD STUFF ON IT
2477,INTO THE LIGHT BULB,INTO THE LIGHT BULB
2478,E PLACE WHERE,EA PLACE WHERET
2479,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WE WERE USEING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
2480,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,IT GOES FROM THE PUIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TILL IT STARTS GOING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOING MORE ELECTRICY TROSSITR FLOWS THEN IT GOES T THE MINE SIDE BILLS UP UND TIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GON FROM THE BLUIDE AND EATHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTER IT WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT
2481,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT,WELL THERE IS THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
2482,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUSIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINE SIDE AND GETS STORE INTO THE MIGNECIDE AND MIGNE SIDE UND TILL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT
2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT IN YOU HAVE A BULE AND A SCRENG ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREAN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATES OM TYPES OF MIXTURE
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRALMECS ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIRE OWN PIL AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE IN
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MOD AND WATER FOR INSTENTS AN YOU PORE IT THOUGH THISS THE FILCER HASAN VERY IMPORTANT ROL BECAUSE WHEL THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,HM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER THE SALT UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A BALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIX TOGETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREAN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREANE AND STAY IN THE BULE THE MARBLES ARE TO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,IT IS CALD WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,OKAY UH GOOD
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIRE OWN YUNE PIL AND THIS IS IPUT IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNEK PIL INSTEAD OF EN ONE ALL TOGETHER IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S A SOLUTIO
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLD A FILLTER AND IT'S U IT'S PERPUS IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDES OF MIXTURES WILL ONE THING SEE THE JAT ATOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND IT STAYES AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND  WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FARE IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTUREIS TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KIND OF STUFF AND THAT AND YEA
2494,SALT,SALT
2495,THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THIS MIXTURE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS,THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THIS MIXTURIES IMPORTANT BECAUSETHERE IS
2496,SOLUTIONS,SOLUTIONS
2497,UH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK,H THE SOLID HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOROUTS AND VEGTEABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT CULLER SQUARL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK
2498,THEY'RE SEPARATING,THEY'RE SEPARATING
2499,THE SALT WILL WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,THE SALT WULD WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2500,GOOD BYE,GOOD BYE
2501,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE PROPERTIES OF SOLT IS THAT  IIS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINIESHED IT LEAVES IT LEAVES NO TRACED THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER
2502,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS ONE ONE OR MORE THES WHEN MOTCALE THINGS ARE MIXTOGETHER AND ARIABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND  SOLUTION IS WHERE CALIPALE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
2503,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,SO THE SOLLID HAS MANY THINGS MIX INTO IT O ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILL OF LIKE JELLY BENS AND NORMAL BENS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES
2504,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM WE CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFE FILLTER IN STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MOD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILLTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN
2505,THEY FLOAT,THAY FLOW
2506,THEY ARE ALL MIXTURES,THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
2507,WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
2508,THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP,THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP
2509,IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE,THI'S CALLED A MIXTURE
2510,I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE,I THINK WE COD BECAUSE EVERY THING CAN BE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR MIXTURE
2511,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS FROM THE TRAILL MAXE SEPARATE AND NHOT'S O IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE

2513,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF OLUTION BIT EATHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDEDET
2514,THEY'RE MORE DILUTED,THEY'RE MORE DILUTED
2515,SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER,SOLUTIONS ARE TWO AND MORE THINGS MIXT TOGETHER
2516,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT,THE DARKER COLERD SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLER HAVE LESS GRAPESTUFF IN IT
2517,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY FULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE FANTASTIC,WE DID THIS IN CLATH AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEAT AND SLIGHTELY SOWER AND VERY VERY VERYBLE IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE TASTTICK
2518,UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM,WE HAVE BEEN STUDDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOD TO SEPARATE THEM
2519,WELL TODAY WE USED UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CAN'T,WELL TODAY WE USE UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USE TAST AND WE ALSO USE SOMETHING ALS AAN
2520,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UM PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE AND IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SODIS THE ONE WITH LESS OR AN PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PEURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE HAN THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES AF PEURPLE
2521,THE SOLVENT,THE SOLVANTE
2522,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POUTER IN IT WOULD TAST MORE SWEAT AND FLIGHTE LY SOWER COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A CUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAP
2523,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LESS IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS A DARKER HAS FIVE SPONS FULES OF GRAPE POUTER AND THE ONE WITH LASS HAS ONLY ONE SPON FULL AND THEY BULHARE APART OF THE JRINK MAGN
2524,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNI FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAN ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WON'T,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNIEY FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TAST SECEAND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAULD ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMARKT SO I WAN'T

2536,ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM,ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IND
2537,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A THINGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD UM YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POR THEM INTO A LITTLE THINGEA AND LET THEM EVAPARATE YOU COLD UM YOUCUD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT I USUALLY SCOGH TH JUST LAT THEM A VAPARATE
2538,ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS,ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS
2539,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE,I CAN TELLYOU THAT WITH THE SALT WTER WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT KNOW IT ICS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASES BUT WITH THE GRAT MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARCER ONE IS IN THE METAL AND ONE IS BLAS PURPLE
2540,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY ONES YOU CAN'T SEE,WE'VE BEEN MARKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HAWD TO TELL THE MACS OF THEM SPESHALLY FOM STUD CANT THN
2541,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SORRY WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN   WHEN YOU PUT THE FETHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN THAN NORML AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S A HEAVIER THAN THE FETHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR
2542,YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,YOU CAN TELL THA SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT
2543,UH ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIETAL
2544,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER,THE FETHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SKILL TOGETHER THE FETHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
2545,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LET SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENDY FIVE MILLILATERS OF WATER BUT WITH THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE
2546,YOU COULD TELL HOW CONCENTRATED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER,YOU CAN TELL HOW CORCANT TRANE  THEY ARE THAT THE COLEROF THEM THE TASTS OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AN THE GROUP DRINKS MIX THE ONE THAT HAS ALESS POUTER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE IT HAS MORE POUTER IS DARKER
2547,BYE MARNI IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE BYE,BYE MARNIE IT WIS REALLY GOD TALKING TO YOU TOUBY BAH
2548,YES,YES
2549,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2550,BY DOING GRAM ADDING,BY DOING THE GRAMSADDING
2551,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT NOT THAT MY PRODUCTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WITHE A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
2552,I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED,I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AN NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED
2553,ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,ONE IS THE LEST CONCENTRATED TO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIETAL
2554,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS,I THINK THE ONE WITH TINY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTEDTHE OTHER ONE HAS LEFT
2555,TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS AGAIN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS THAT'S WHAT THIS PICTURE SHOWS I'M DONE,TEN GRAMS PULT TWENTY GRAMS PUT TWENTY GRAMS AGAIN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS THAT'S WHAT THIS PICTURE SHOWSM DN

2564,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS,THERE MANY WAYS YOUCOULD DO THAT YOU COULD LET THE THING AVAPARATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREN YOU COULD USE A UH YOU COULDJUST SEUS YOUR HANDS
2565,A MIXTURE,A MIXSTURE
2566,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER,IS THE LITTLE TINNY GRANS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNIEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARAT IT SALT FROM THE WATER
2567,I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER,I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSALTP IN THE WATER
2568,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTALS,HER WHONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GESING THAT IT IH SALT IS MIX WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER ITSUM IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS ISWITH NOTHING BUT FLCK  SOLUB
2569,SOLUTION,SOLUTION
2570,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU POR TOU THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEIVE THEM THR THE SALT STAYES AND THE WATER DISAPEIRES
2571,HERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT,HAR THE SALT CAN BE DISOLVED IN THE WATER BUT THE WATER CANNOT BE DISOLVED IN THE SALT
2572,IT IS EVAPORATING,IT IS A VAPORATER
2573,YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND,YOU CAN LET IT AVAPARATE YOU CAND PICK IT OUT BY HANDS
2574,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT,THAT WHEN YU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREAT A DIFFERENT WEIGHT
2575,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
2576,HERE THE FLOUR IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ONTO THE BOTTOM AND AND THE REST OF THE FLOUR STAYS ON THE TOP IN THE COFFEE FILTER,HEAR THE FLOWER IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER UM THE WATER GETS PORD DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ON TO THE BOTTEOM AND HE AND THE REST OF THE FLOWER STAYS FROM THE TOP AN THE COPY BILLTER
2577,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS PICTURE MARNIY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT O WATER IT CREATS A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHES FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WAGYS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRA
2578,A MIXTURE,A MIXTURE
2579,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,THE WATER WEIGS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SOALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU AD THEM TOGETHER IT CREATS A MIXTURE AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
2580,GOOD,GOOD
2581,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTIONS,ITWHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIX WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTION
2582,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU PORE ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN YUSE SCL FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET IKE SOME GRAM CUBES AN YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUPYOU CAN CREATE M WEAIGH THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT
2583,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP A HAND A FILTUR DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT AVAPARATE
2584,THAT WATER PLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION,THAT WATER PLES DIFFENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION
2585,SURE MARNEY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS,SURE MARNIEY SO WHAT WE TALKE ABOUT WHITH TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS W CHUCK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXT TOOGETHER WE ALL SO TALKE ABOUT IN MY APINION BATST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER AF THATTHRAY AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFFT WITH SALT CRISTALS
2586,THE SALT,THE SALT
2587,THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE,THE SOALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S PORED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE
2588,ONE KIND OF GRAMS PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS GRAM TOGETHER,ONE KIND OF GRAM PLESS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUAL YGRAMS TOGETHER
2589,THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE,THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE
2590,YOU COULD LET IT EVAPORATE,YOU CAN LET IT AVAPORATES
2591,NO,NO
2592,TIME,TIME
2593,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE AND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL,THIS IS CALLD AVAPARATION MARNIY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POR IT INTO IT THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THEEAIR FOR WILL THE WATER WILL AVAPARATE INTO THE AIR AND THE WATE IN A SALT CRISTLS WILL UHWILL STAY AND THAIRE AND TNHAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONES IN FRRAL
2594,I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION,I NOTICED THAT THE SICCURET SITIC AED IS BING PORED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAK THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILERAND THEN WHEN YOU DUN YOU CAN CLEARALY SEE THAT ALL OF IT GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUIT BELOW THERE IS NOTHING LEFF IN THE COFFE FILTER THIS IS CALLD A SOLUTION
2595,THE SAND AND IN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE THE SAND STAYS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YOU IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT,THE SAND AND WOK IN THE SAND AND WATER MIX SURE THE THE SAND STAYS ANT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YOU THE IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT
2596,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EATHER WEIGHT TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY'RE MIX TOGETHER THEY CREAT FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY'RE MIX TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENTKINDS THINGS ARE MIX TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN YUNEAK PIUL
2597,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASTH OR WEIGHT
2598,I KNOW THAT NOTICE THAT SALT IS BEING MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP WITH THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER,I NO THE NOTICE THAT SALT IS BENG MIXT WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S PORED DOWN A COFFE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT IS INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP OF THE COFFE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITHTHE WATER

2631,WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED STICKERS AND WE PUT EM ON A GRAPH TO SHOW UM HOW MANY SPACERS THAT WE COULD USE BEFORE THE MAGNETIC FIELD BROKE,WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED THICKERS AND WE PUT TIM ON A GRAPF TO SHOW HOW HOW MANIY SPASERS THAT WE COULD USE BEFORE THE MAGNETTIC FEELD BROK
2632,WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAPHING THE INFORMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AS THE MORE SPACERS THAT YOU PUT AND HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL GET,WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAFFING THE INFERMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AS THE MORE SPASERS THAT YOU PUT IN HOW STRONG THE MAGNETICK FEELD WILL GET
2633,WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD UM TWO MAGNETS ONE WAS IN A PLASTIC CUP THE OTHER WAS ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE AND WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY WASHERS WE COULD FIT INTO ANOTHER CUP,WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD ONM TWO MAGNETS ONE WAS IN A PLASTICK CUP THE OTHER WAS AT TACH TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCAL AND WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY WASHERS WE COULD FIT INTO ANOTHER CUP
2634,UM FOR THIS EXPERIMENT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE STANDARDS,FOR THIS EXPERIMENT I'M NOT QUIGHT SURE WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE STANDERDS
2635,YOU'RE WELCOME,YUR WELCOMES
2636,MMM THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT CAUSE THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU ADDED THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAD SO THE LESS WASHERS YOU CAN FIT INTO THE CUP,THERE WASN'T LITTLE BIT CAUSE THE MORE SPASCERS THAT YOU ADDED THE LESS UM MAGNETTIC FORCE IT ADS SO THE LESS WASHERS YOU CAN FIT INTO THE CUP
2637,YES IT WAS,YES IT WAS
2638,DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FIELD WOULD FLOW THROUGH TO KEEP IT HELD SO THAT THE BALANCE WOULDN'T BREAK,DSSCUVERD THAT THE MORE SPACERS THAT YOU WULD PUT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THE LESS  MAGNETIC FEEULD WULD FLOW THROUGH TO KEEP IT HEL THAT THE BAOLANCS WOULDN'T BREAK
2639,YES THEY DID,S THEAY DIN
2640,WHAT WE FOUND WAS UM THE INFORMATION ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS,WHAT WE FOUND WAS M THE IFRMATSION ON HOW STRONG A MAGNETTIC FEEALD IS
2641,TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU PUT UM S THINGS OR IN THIS CASE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE LESS MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAS,ELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU PUT  THINGS ARE IN THE SPASE SPASERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE LESS MAGNETTIC FORCE IT HAS
2642,WELL I FOUND OUT THAT UM WITH THE REGULAR MAGNET YOU CAN FIT TWENTY ONE WASHERS INTO THE OTHER CUP BEFORE BREAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD,WELL I FOUND OUT THAT UM WITH THE REGULER MAGNET YOU COULD FIT TWENTY ONE WASHERS INTO THE OTHER CUP BEFOR BREAKING THE MAGNETICK FEELD
2643,UM NO NOT ALL OF US DID BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY COMPARE THE RESULTS THAT EACH GROUP GOT,NO NOT ALL OF US DID BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY COMPAR THE RESULTS THAT EACH GROUP GOT

3667,SEE YOU LATER TOO BYE,SEE IT LATER TO BYE
3668,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF,I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I NOW THAT IF YOU PUT ON WACXS PAPER IT MAKES A DOM KIND OF
3669,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ASORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO N IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH,IT IS TOLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKES UP ANE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROUM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAPE AND SOAPE DOESN'T ABSORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAPE MAKES IT SO IT THAT TAKES UP MORE ROUM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH
3670,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THATS WHAD IT HAPPENS
3671,IT GETS BIGGER,IT GETS BIGER
3672,THE BATTERY IT IT UM WELL IT HAS ELECTRICITY INSIDE OF IT,THE BATTERY IT UM WHT HAS ELECTRICITY IAND SIDE OF IT

3811,IT IS GOING THROUGH ONE END OF THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING BULBS UP AGAIN AND THEN GOING AND THEN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,IT IS GOING THROUGH ANE AND OF THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LINDING THE BULBS UP AGAIN AND THTHE EN GO IN AN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3812,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE
3813,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE D CELL FLOW THROUGH THROW THROUGH ONE HI ONE LIGHT BULB LIGHTED UP AND THEN COME BACK TO THE D CELL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND COME BACK TO THE D CELL,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE D CELL FLOW THROUGH THROUWGH THROUGH ONE HIT ONE LIGHT BULB LIGHT IT UP AND THEN COME BACK TO THE  CELL THEN THE OTHER ENERGYS TAKE OFF GOW THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND COME BACK TO THE D CELL
3814,I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
3815,HELLO MARNIE,HIT ALOH MARNIE
3816,THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINED,THE  ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINE
3817,HELLO,HELLOW
3818,BYE,BYE
3819,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL COMING OUT OF THE OTHER END LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST GOING THROUGH A THIN A THIN WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB THEN GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL AND REPEATING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL COMING OUT THE OTHER AND HE LIGHTING OUT THE LIGHT BULB PUCH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST TOING THROUGH A A THIN WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB THEN GOING BACK THROUG THE D CELL AND REPEATTING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3820,THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PATH NO TWO TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY,THAT PARALLEL CIRCUIT  HAVE ONLY ONE PAT NOT TWO TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY
3821,THE D CELL IS LETTING ENERGY THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY,THE D CELL IS LETDING ENERGY THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BULB IS LIGHT UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY
3822,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT THAN THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHERRING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT WELL E AND THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS
3823,M WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL CAUSE UM SINCE THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WIDTH ER THEY'RE ALL WIDER,UM WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE SCENTIMETERS BUT THE REESAON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ANT AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIGTER I THINK WELLBCAUSE UM SINSTHEYRE ALL THREY SCENTIMETERS HEY'RE NOT ALLGONT HTHTHE'RE THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CURTON THEY THEY'E ALL DIFFER FERENT UND THEY ALLIWT DIFFERENTWITH OR THEY'RE ALL WIGHTER
3824,HI,A
3825,WELL WIDENESS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE AND A CIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHER'S JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S WIDER HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FOURTH GRADE THAT IF YOU S IF THAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'LL FLOAT SO WITH THE BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH THE WIDER BOAT CUP BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOAT BETTER AND HOLD MORE PASSENGERS,UM WELL WIS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE THUM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIZE AND I IT'S CICIRCLL ONE FOUT WIE AND HE OTHER IS JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHTH OTHER ONE WILL FLOW BETTER AND ITWILL HOULD MORE PASSENGERS NS IT'S ITH WIERND HATS MORE RM AND IT 'LL FLOW BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL IT IT'LL FLOW BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMBL WE UM LEARNED AND FORTH GRAT THAT IF YOU SIF THAT THE BUGS T WK AND WATER THEY SPRED THER WEIGHT EAVENLY SO THAT THELL FLOWT SO WIGH WITH THE BIG BOT HAT'S WITH THE WIGHTER BOUT CUP SSI IN OR BOUT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN AIT 'ILL JUST FLOW BETERAND HI MORE PASENGERERS
3826,UM WAIT BOATS ARE,UM WAIY BOATS
3827,L FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO SPREAD 'EM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK 'EM TO ALL ONE SIDE ELSE YOU WON'T GET THE ANSWER YOU NEED TO KIND OF SPREAD 'EM EVENLY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS UM MY PARTNER WE HAD THE SAME BOAT THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE HE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURED OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN 'EM OUT,WELL FIRST WELL YOU NEED TO SPRED IM EAVEN LY YOU CAN'T STACK THT ALL TO ONE SID ON'T SEYU WON'T GET THE RIGHT ANER NEED OKIND OF SPRED IM EAVALY AROUND THE BOUT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARNERS U MY PARDNER WEGATD THE SAME BOT M THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE HE GOT AND OR NINE PENNESE BUT THEN I FIGURED I WAS ACTUALLY FORTTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EAVEN AMOUT
3828,WELL I'D WELL I'D WELL FIRST I'D LIKE PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNIES IN THEN YOU WANT TO PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YEAH CAUSE YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK CAUSE IF IF EIGHT WITH EIGHT PENNIES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL UM IF THEY IF EIGHT PENNIES SINKS IT THEN THE RESULTS WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES,WELL I WELL I WELL FIRST I I PUT THE BOT THER CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNES IN THEN YU WEN'T PUTAS MANNY PENNES IN AS YOU CANT BUT AND THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK AND THAT'S YOUR ANSER LIKE YEAH CAUSE YOUDON'T HEP THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK ECAUCAUSE IF IF AIAHT IF WITH EAIGHT PENNES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL UM IF TIKE LIKE IF EIHT PENNYSINKS IT THEN THE RESULTS WULD BE SEVEN PENNES
3829,IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE THAT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE,IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THER THAT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
3830,WELL UM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PENNIES LIKE ALL TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD KIND OF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU EVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST STAY EVEN AND AND AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER,WWELL IM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PAPENNIUS LIKE ALL TO ONE ONE SIDE OF IT KIND OF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU ATN'T IT OUT IT'WALL IT WON'T TIP TO ENY SIDE IT'LL JUST  EAVNT AND AND UM MITALL FLOUT GET BETTER
3831,UM I THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAT IT MIGHT SO THAT ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE,UI WHELL I THOGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE W THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LETS SAY ONE OF THOS BIG GLASS THO CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THERE'S SAME HIGHT IT CAN STELL LIKE OFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIGHTER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIE SO THT MIGHT SO THAT'S ONE MIGHT FLOWTE MORE
3832,UM WELL THERE ONE H ONE UM CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER S SIDE THERE'S T TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S STARTING TO TIP THAT WAY AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GONNA TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK,UM WELL THERE ONE PE ONE OUM CUP IT'S ALL SENNERD SO IT'S EAVENALY SPRED AND THE WEIGHTS EAVEN BUT ON TE OTHER SSIDE THERE'S TO TWO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO I'S TARING TO TIP THAT WAY AND AND IF FYOU AD A FEWO MOREIT'S GON TO TIP COMPLEATLY AND ITS ILLJUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK EL
3833,YEAH IT DOESN'T LOOK,AT DOESN'T LOOK
3834,YO WHAT UP I'M READY TO LEARN,YOUL WUT UP UM REDI TOGRN
3835,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HEIGHTS AND ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY WANNA TEST WHICH ONE WILL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATER,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOUTS AND LOOKS LIKE AND A BOUT TIGHTAND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WANT A TES WHITCH ICH WICH ONE CHILL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS ARR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATERATER
3836,UM YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO ME I'M READY TO TALK,UM YOU CAN TALK TO ME I'M REDY TO TALK
3837,UM WELL,UM WELL
3838,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TESTING HERE,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEYRE TESTING HEAR
3839,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WHOEVER'S TRYING TO TEST IS SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECA SEEING UM IF A SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AND YEAH,UIT LOOKS LIKE THE HO EVER IS TRYING TO TESKT TO SING IF THE HIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECUH SEING UM IF THE SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGER ONE AND  YEAH
3840,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A LIKE A KIND OF WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT COULD FILL WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE'S A TON OF WAVES AND IT DID SEE IT TI IT SWIVELS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST STAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST STAY FLAT IF IT THE WATER'S CALM IT WORKS BETTER,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE LIKE A HUN A WAIVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERY WERE THE BL IT FILED WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT OULD JUST TIP IF THERE'S A TUN WAIVES AND IT DONT SEE IT'S TI IT'S SWIERLS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S COM THEN ITWILL JUST SAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT LUTS IT WILL JUST STAY FLAT AND IF IT' THE WATER'S CMET IT WORKS BETTER
3841,UM WHEN WE MADE THE BOATS WELL WE WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW MANY PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH WATER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF THE WELL NO BUT UM IF LIKE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT,UM WHEN WE MATE THE BOATS WELL W HWE WANT IT TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW MNY PENNES TIY CAND HOLD OR HOW HOW MUCH WATERTER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF THE HUAT WELL NOW BUT UM IF TLIKE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT
3842,UM HOW H HARD,UM HOW HARD
3843,BYE,BYE
3844,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF THERE IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME JUST SEE IF IT'LL AFFECT IT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THING  UM AND A CONTROLLED EXPPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF FEOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONES AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD UM SHEAT ABOUT THAT ASKING IF IT'S A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU IEX BECAUSE YOU SHEONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS ATA TIME TO SE IFITLL AFFECT TAT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
3845,UH LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH,UH LOOKS LIKE THERE TRYING TO FORGOT HOWMNY TIMES IT SWINGS IN HEFIFTEN R ABOUT FIFTEEN SECANDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE AR S IT WASN'T MUCH
3846,WELL WE HAD WE EVEN HAD A TWO HUNDRED,WELL WE AD WE 'VEN HAD UH TWO HUNDRED
3847,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT WELL RECORDING INFORMATION LIKE LET'S SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING A FORTY CENTIMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN ON THE GRAPH WE WE DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE LIKE A TOWER ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION,UM A GRAFF IS ABOUT LIKE UM RECORDING  IMFRMATION LIKE UT SAY WE HAD A THIRTY SENTERMETER STRING OF FORTY SENTIMETER STRING D OF FIFTY SENTIMETER STRING THEND ON THE GRAFF WE WE DO THE THIRTY SENTERMETER STRING N THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREEY FOR FIVE SIX SEVEND ALL WE P TO TWENTY PER HAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE IKE U TOWER ALL TH WAY UP TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE IMFRMATION
3848,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PER PAPER AIRPLANES AND VARIABLES THAT ARE FO UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPERCLIP AND TAPE AND IT FLIES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE WE THIS WAS JUST DEMANSTRATION SHE T SHOWED US FOR PARPAPER AIRPLANES IND VARIABLES AT OF FUM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU AD A PAPER CLIP AND TAP AN IFLYES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT' MADE IT TO BETTER SO THAT'S WHY I SHONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
3849,UM VARIABLE IS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD AFFECT IT,UM VARIABLE WAS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGE WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALLSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THLENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF IT COULD AFFECTED IT
3850,M WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID LIKE IT UM SWUNG MORE MORE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE,WELL WHEN WE UM TRYE THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID DO LIKE IT UM SWUNG MORE MORE AND FIFTEEN SECANDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOK LONGER TO SWING MYUSUALLY ONLY GOT EAIGHT OR NINE
3851,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT CONTROLLED,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A CUPELE DIFFERENT STRINGS THERE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THATS O MAKES A CONTROLL
3852,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SIZED OF PAPERCLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPERCLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL UM WE CKEPT LIKE THERE DIFFERENT SIZED PAPER CLIPS BUT WE CEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPER CLIP THE HOOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH IT'S PRY MUCH IT
3853,NO WELL THE PAPERCLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPERCLIP SIZE,UM I THE PAPER CLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE HOLLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRINGS SO THE ONLYTHING WE KEPT THE SAME AS THE PAPER CLIPSIZE
3854,OKAY WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS OF THE BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT,K IH UND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENGJELLUMSMOVHE AND IF THE MASS TOF THE BOB FECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT
3855,UM THE WAY WE SHOWED THE RESULT IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT LIKE WELL WE HELD IT AND WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER,UM WHEN WE SHOWE THE RESULT AS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPTD IT PLANK WHELL WE HELLED IT NDTHENWHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED OUS AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECANDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSER
3856,M,M
3857,UM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME,UM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS I ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
3858,UM WELL THIS KIND OF CONNECTS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU CAN DO TO SHOWS ALL THE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT JUST LIKE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR LIKE THE SLOPE LIKE RIGHT HERE,SO THIS IS IS KIND OF S IS S EXACT LIKE OURPLANE SO WE HAVE BEN CHAPE WE I THINK WE MIGHT CHANGE THEUM
3859,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE THO PEAPLE AREXSPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENTE ANGLE
3860,UM YOU,UM YOLOOU
3861,WELL WE FIGURED OUT IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT,WELL WE FEERED IT TOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE POR SENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHARPT IS RONG CAUSE IT TOCK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE POR SENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS S HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAFFE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT
3862,UM THE RUBBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES GETS IT TO MOVE,UM THE RUBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGSION AT'S JUST WHAT MAES GETS UP TO MOVE
3863,THE ANGLE OF THE STRING BUT YEAH,THINKES STRING BUT YEAH
3864,FOUR METERS SORRY I MEAN IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS,FOR METERS SORRY I MENT IT LOKS TE GIS WHENT FOR METERS AT FORTY FIVE LINES
3865,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,UM IT LOOKS LIKE HIS REOLW BART'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FARE T THE PLAN WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINES AND YEAH
3866,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,UM WELLWEREJUST WEARNG THE JUST OAINTOF MAKE THE COL CONGAPSION LIKE WE HVE THE PROPELLER TTHE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED I IT UP IT'S CIT OF LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LIE THECAUSE UM YU HAH THE PROPELLER POWER AN AND THE BRNING THE TRYPE PUTTNG PASERANGERS ARON TO SEE IF IT AFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASNGUSE IR PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH
3867,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERS THAT THAT'S THE MAIN POWER THE PLAN WITH OUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEND IT' JUST  KIND TO SIT THERE
3868,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIAL YOU USE TO BILD IT THE CONSTRUCTON A LOT OF THINGS
3869,S SO,IS O
3870,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THE THE FIGHT FLIGHT LIND OOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP WORED AND YEAH LOOK WILL IF LOOKS LIKE IT'S PILLED UP JUST LIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH
3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLAN AND THIS YUT REAL SEE HOW FARE IT'S CAN IT GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE A PRETTY FAR FOR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINES SO YEAH
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OWERS IS A RBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALLSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE ME LIKE CHAIRES SO THAT THE WIRE WILL WITH LIKE HSTAY ON SAT THE WIRE WRE ADWE CAN TIGH THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRES AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELER ON AD JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
3873,HI,HYE
3874,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FARE IT CAN GO WERE HOW FAST IREALLY DEPENDS BUT IN NEALSO DEPENDS WITH VARIABL YOU CHANGE BUT EREIS THAT YOU CAN JUST I BUT TO HOW HOW FAST OU WANT IT TO GO HOW FARIS ARAL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YUT CAN CHANGE
3875,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,UM WELL AR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORDTAN HAF WEAIG IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PER SENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNED IT LOOKS HERE THAT THI RAF WOULDNT BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAD IT TOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR IT OSS TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PER SENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERED ONLY SAYS TWENTY TWO INS FOR TWO METERS SO HAITD BE IN CORRECT AND UM YEAH
3876,W WELL WE HAVE A S WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN IN HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THIS S PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND THE PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE,WELL WE HAVE A SWE HAVE THREE STRAIYS WHEN THEY GOET HENE THEY GOESN THE WIR AND THEN IUM HEREN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DDOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STABLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THE PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND AND A PECE CIGLS IN THE BAG TAT CONNECTS THE RUBER BAND AND THEN YOU UST MAKE THIS PLAN
3877,UM ONE THING THAT AFFECT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAN AFFECT IT IS THE TYPE OF STRING IN OUR CASE WE'RE DOING FISHING WIRE BUT T IT COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING OR UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS AND THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS,UM ONE THING THAWIT AFFECTIS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIUS LY AND ANOTHER THING THAT AFFECTED IS THE TYPE OF STRING AN ARKITS WOULDING FISHING WIRE BUT YOUCOULD DEPENDWAT KIND OF STRING YOURE USING HRE UH MANNY THINGS THAT OTD AFFECTTI BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS IN THE TYPE OF STRING AR R ONE TWO THE MAIN THINGS
3878,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ANGLED LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CL IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT,WELL THINGLE DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT IT MENG IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE INGLE LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONTO GET ANY WERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST IT SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'ILL SLOW IT DOWN BECAUSE IT'S TRINED  LIKE CLIME A HILLE BECAUSE FOR EXAMPL IF I'M CLOT IF YOU'RE CLIMING IT A HILLE YOU GET MORE EXOSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILLE AND GOING DOWN IT
3879,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS UP WE WANT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE WO A YARD AND A HALF,WELLWE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWING ORS BUT WE WANTD TO GET OURSIP WE WANT BUT THE GOLE IS TO MAKE OARS MOVE A YARD AND A HAFF
3880,UM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND,I WE NEED DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW MANY INES WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO HAVE CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT OLY ONE THING ATD A TIME IN
3881,WELL THE THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE ON THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER,WELL THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT CON O FLY AS FARBECAUSE IT'S APE UP SO IT HAS IT IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE AT THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER
3882,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAKE AIRPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE BIGERPLANS TETO ON FISHING WIRE
3883,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU'LL YOU COULD CHANGE,WELL YOU CUD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WHE IS FISHING WIR YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S LONGER ONE A SHORTER ONE IFTHERE'S A TOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THSE ART THE MAN THINGS YOU WAN'T YOU ULD CHANGE
3884,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP ABIT BUT NOT SURE BUT T LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PERTY GOOD PLANE
3885,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FORTY FIVE,IT LOOKS LIKE A JUST WEN FORTY FIV
3886,BYE,MOAN
3887,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GO BUMPY AND THEN IT'LL LIKE AFFECT IT AND WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEED A WELL THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOOTH LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR UH STEEP UP OR ELSE IT'LL UM THEN IT'LL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH,ONE THING THAT'SH IMPORTANT SED IT WOGOES SMOUTHELY IT CAN'T LIKE GOTTA BUMBE AND THE METTAL LIKE OFFEC IT AND WELL YOUN YOU NEED A YIUR ES GRAIT WELL IL THAT'S YOUJUST KEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOTHE LINE IT CAN'T BE TWO FOT  STEAP UPPRALD IT ALL UM I WEL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EUVE AND NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH
3888,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TA CHANGE THAT OBVIUSSLY AND OU SEEMES LIKE CHANGE THE WINE OR SO IT'S JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSER AND SEE HOW DIFFEREFERENT IT IS
3889,WHAT,WHAT
3890,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,WELL YOU USE A ELL THE TOELES TO MAKE THE PLANE AND YOUSE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
3891,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING,A METRIC ROOULER OR SOMETHING
3892,YEAH YEAH THAT'S,YEAHYEA
3893,HI,E

3907,YEAH,YEAH
3908,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL,LIKE DESK S AND AIDIT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL
3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,ONE HUNDRED SCENTIEMETERIEAS
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SE OME CUNCRES DON'T KNOW ABOUT ROULLER IS END THEY EAT DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGOING THA THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOL IRK SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METIC SYSTEM SO WUSED AND MEXTRICIC SYXSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER KINTRE S
3911,OH NO,IOL NO
3912,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF WE'RE ONE METRIC ONE METER HIGH NO,LET US NO WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IT FOR ONE NAT CHIC ONE METER HI NO
3913,TEN,TEN
3914,WE USED A,WE USE AM
3915,THEN YOU,BEN YOU
3916,STRAWS,STRAIES
3917,UH WHEN IT'S STANDARD THAT MEANS IT'S ALL THE SAME WHICH MAKES IT WHICH MAKES YOUR WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING THE SAME WHEN IT WHEN IT'S EQUAL,WHEN IT STANDERD THAT MEANS IT'S ALL THE SAME WHITCHS MAKES IT WHICH MAKES FHERY WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING THE SAME WHEN IT WHEN IT'S EQUAL
3918,BECAUSE THE METER TAPE HAS ONE HUNDRED DECAMETERS,BECAUSE THE METER TAPE HAS ONE HUNRED DECCMETERS
3919,YEAH YEAH,YEAH UTERYEAH
3920,YEAH,YEAH
3921,UH YOU N IT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG OR HOW WIDE OR HOW TALL IT IS,AH YUM IT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONGER HOW WIGT OR HOW TALL IT IS
3922,IT WAS ALL,IT WAS ALL
3923,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME ANSWER,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAM AND SARER
3924,IT WAS A PAPERY AND LONG,ILL IS A PAPERE AND LONG
3925,WE DIDN'T GET A THREE OR A FOUR OR,WE DIDN'T GET AH THREEAR AFOR URY
3926,THEY'RE LITTLE LINES,THERE THE Y LITTLE LIEME
3927,BEC SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHERE THE DECAMETER WAS AND THE CENTIMETER,WBE SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHAT THE DECUMETERAL ISE AND THAE SENDEM METER
3928,NO,NO
3929,OH THERE'S TEN IN ONE DECAMETER,OH THERE'S TEN AND THE WAN DECK O IN ETING
3930,THEN WE GOT M WE DIDN'T GET A WHOLE NUMBER,THEN WE GOT WE DIDN'T GET A HOLL NUMBER
3931,THEY WERE CUT UNEQUALLY,THEY WERE CUT UN EQUALLY
3932,THAT'S THAT'S TEN CENTIMETERS,THAT'S THAT'S TENENNMETERIES
3933,THAT MEANS IT'S,THAT MEANS ITS
3934,YEAH,YEAH
3935,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS INTO ONES THAT WERE EQUAL,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS AIND TO ONES THAT WHERE EQUAL
3936,YEAH,YEAH
3937,THAT THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN IT,THAT THERE'S TEN SENNMEEGERS INET
3938,ONE FIFTH OF A,ONE SHISH HELL TH
3939,BECAUSE THERE'S AN EMPTY IN FRONT OF AN E T IN FRONT OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THEN AN M E T IN FRONT OF THE METER,BECAUSE THERE IS AN EMNTY IND FRON OF ENMEITY IND FRONT OF THE METURIC SYSTEM AND THEN AN EMITY IND FRONT OF THE METER
3940,TO MEASURE OUR DESKS WITH,TO MASYIURH O DES CLIP
3941,YEAH UH IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY AGREES ON AND,YEAH UH IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERY BUDY DEGREES IN AND
3942,NO,NO
3943,UH YOU CAN MEASURE,HYOU CAN MEASUR
3944,YEAH WE MEASURED IT WITH A UNEQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR OUR FOR HOW HOW BIG OUR DESKS ARE,YEAH WE MEASURED IT WITH AN UN EQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANT THIIS FOR OARE FOR HARB HOW BIG OUR DESHICTS ARE
3945,UM MEASUREMENTS UH THE METRIC SYSTEM,UM MEASUREMENT AH TH METRIC SYSTEM
3946,YOU COULD TELL IF IT WAS FIVE OR,YOU COULD TELL IF IT WAS BYIOR
3947,YES,YEAH
3948,THAT MEANS THAT THE UNEQUAL LENGTH STRAWS WERE WEREN'T THE RIGHT SIZE BUT THE EQUAL STRAWS WERE THE RIGHT SIZE,THAT MEANS THAT THE UN EQUAL LENGTH STRAWS WHERE WERENT THE RIGHT SIZE BUT THE EQUAL STRAWS WHERE THE RIGHT SIZE
3949,TEN,KAN
3950,MOST OF THE PEOPLE GOT THREE AND OUR TEAM GOT FOUR,MOST OF THE F PUL GOT THIREEY AND ARTEM GOT FORE
3951,THE METRIC SYSTEM,THE MAGIC SYSTEM
3952,NO,NO
3953,A YOU CAN MEASURE AROUND IT WHEN IT'S A METER TAPE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO GO AROUND,A YOU CAN MEASURE AROUND IT WHEN IT'S SOMMETER TAFE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO GO AROUND
3954,FIVE OR ONE OR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR ANY OF THE NUMBERS UNDER TEN UH UH FOR DECAMETERS,FIVE OR ONE OR TWO LIKE THR YEAR FORE OR ANY OF THE NUMBERS UNDER TEN UH UH FOR DECOMETERS
3955,LIQUID FROM OUR WATER YES,E LIQUID FRM R WATER YES

3965,LIQUID,LIQUID
3966,TEN,TEN
3967,OH SO WE USED A TEN MILLILITER THING TO SEE HOW MANY WOULD GO INTO,SO WES THE TEN MILLILITER THINGS TO SEE HOW MANY WOULD GO IN TO
3968,IT GOES UP TO NINE HUNDRED AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THING AND TEN TENS AND HUNDRED EQUALS ONE THOUSAND,IT GOES UP TO NINE HUNDRED AND THEN THERE'S AN ON THERE THING AND TEN TINMES AND HUNDRED EQUALS ONE THOUSAND
3969,ONE METER,ONE MITER
