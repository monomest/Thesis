483,UM THAT'S CALLED A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND UM IT IT WILL LET THE LI ALL THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH AND IT WILL UM LET IT'LL LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB,UM THAT'S CAS A CLOSE CIRCUIT AND UM IT IT WILL LET THE LET ALL THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH AND IT WILL UHM LET IT'LL LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
484,THE SPONGE DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S AN INSULATOR AND INSULATORS DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SO IT WOULD IT WON'T LET THE MOTOR TURN ON,THE SPONGE DIDN'T WORKS BECAUSE IT'S AN INSULATER AND INSULATORS DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH S IT WOULDS I WHAT LETS THE MOROR TURN ON
485,UH I DON'T THINK IT IS I THINK IT'S A CIRCUIT CIRCLE,I DON'T THINK IT IS I THINK IT'S A SCALK IT'S CARCKALE
486,UM IN CLASS WE HAVE AND WE'VE DONE ONE MORE THING WE HAVE THIS BLUE THING WE PUT THE BATTERY IN AND THIS RED THING THAT WOULD HOLD THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT HAD A WHOLE WIRE LIKE SET UP,UM IN CLASS WE HAVE AND WE'VE DONE ONE MOET THING WE HAVE THIS BLUE THING WE PUT THE BATTERY AND AND THIS WED THING THAT WOULD HOLD THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT HAD A HOL WIRE LIKE SITUP
487,YES UM THE WIRE ON THE RIGHT MUST TOUCH THE SIDE AND THE WIRE ON THE LEFT MUST TOUCH THE BOTTOM,YES OM THE WIALL ON THE LRIGHT MUST TOUCH THE SIDE AND THE WIL ON THE LEFT MOUCH TOUCH THE BOTTOM
488,MMM NO NOT REALLY,NO NOT REALLY
489,WE FOUND OUT THAT ONE WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ANOTHER WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB,WE FOUND OUT THAT ONE MIL HAD TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IND A NOTHER WIL HAD TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB
490,UM WE'VE BEEN GETTING A D BATTERY AND UM WE HAD TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO ATTACH THEM SOMEHOW AND GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP,UM WE'VE BEEN GETTING A D BATTERY AND UM WE HAD TWO WILES AND WE HAD TO ATACH THUM SOME HOW AND GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP
491,I THINK THAT ONCE THE ELECTRICITY GOES UP THE WIRE ON THE INSIDE THE FILAMENT LIGHTS UP CAUSING IT THE THE WHOLE GLASS BULB TO SHINE,I THINK THAT ONES E ELECTRICITY GOES UP THE WIRE ON THE INSIDE THE FILLING ENT LIGHTS UP CAUSING IT THE THE HOL GLASS BULB TO SHINE
492,I THINK THAT IS ABOUT BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT UP I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT WAY,I THINK THAT IS ABOUT BECAUSE AN NOTLE FOAT TO LIGHT UP I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT WAY
493,SO IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE,SO IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE
494,I MEAN THAT UM THE CIRC THE ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRE IN THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY,I MEAN THAT UM THE SLCKTHE ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WILE IN THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
495,YES LIKE THAT,YES LIKE THAT
496,IT COULD BE BUT I KNOW IT'S A SOCKET CIRCLE,IT COOULD BE BUT I NOW IT I'S A SOACKET SOACKALL
497,WHAT DID YOU SAY,WHAT DID YOU SAY
498,UM I'M NOT SURE,UM I'M NOT SORE
499,SURE,SILL
500,I THINK THIS IS ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND COMING BACK INTO THE BATTERY,I THINK THIS IS ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRE OND COMING BACK INTO THE BATTERY
501,I THINK THERE ARE IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE RIGHT NOW,I THINK THEY'RE WLL IT'S JUSTD THATI DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ALL RIGHT NOW
502,UM BECAUSE THE GLASS DOESN'T HAVE ANY WIRES ATTACHED TO IT SO IT WOULDN'T LIGHT,UM BECAUSE THE GLAS DOESN'T HAVE ANY WILES ATTACH TO IT SO IT WOULDN'T LIGHT
503,WE UM WE DID IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY WE TOOK TWO WIRES ATTACHED ONE TO THE NEGATIVE ONE TO THE POSITIVE AND THEN WE HAD THE LIGHT BULB AND WE PUT THE TWO SIDE ONE SIDE FROM EACH UM ONE SIDE FROM EACH WIRE AND ATTA UM TACH THE LIGHT BULB AND IT LIT UP,UM WE DIDT IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT LY WE TOCK TWO WILS ATTACH ONE TO THE NEGATIVE ONE TO THE POSITIVE AND THEN WE HAD THE LIGHT BULB AND WE PUT THE TWO ST ONE SIDE FROM EACH UM ONE SIDE FROM EACH WIL AND TUM TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB AND IT LIT UP
504,YES,YES
505,UM A CIRCUIT WELL I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT A CIRCUIT CIRCLE IS THE LIGHT BULB AND THE WIRE AND IT RUNS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND KEEPS ON GOING IN A CIRCLE,UM I SACKIT WELL I'M NOT EXACTLLY SHALB BUT A SACKUIT SACKLE IS THE LIGHT BULB AND THE WIAULB AND IT RUNS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND KEEPS ONE GOING IN A SACKALE
506,UM THAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE TAKES ELECTRICITY IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE AND FROM THE PICTURE IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH THIS M METAL THING IN THE LIGHT BULB AND CAUSES IT TO LIGHT UP,UM THAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE TAKES ELECTRICITY IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIUL AND IFROM THE PICTRE IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOWS THROUGH THIS METAL THING THE LIGHT BULB AND CAOUSES IT TO LIGHT UP
507,UM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE WIRES TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB OTHERWISE IT WON'T LIGHT AND THEREFORE NO LIGHT,UM I THINK IT'S IM PAT FOR THE WILLES TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB OTHERWIZS IT WON'T LIGHT AND THEY'LL FALL NO LIGHT
508,UM THE ONE WITH THE MINUS SIDE IS CALLED THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE ONE WITH THE PLUS SIGN IS CALLED THE POSITIVE SIDE,UM THE ONE WITH THE MINESIDE IS CALLED THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE ONE WITH THE PLOSINE IS CALLD THE POSITIVE SIDE
509,YES EXCEPT THE BLUE THING WASN'T AS BIG,YES IT SET THE BLUE THING WASN'T AS BIG
510,NO BECAUSE IT THE LOOKS LIKE THAT IT THE METAL ON THE INSIDE MUST BE TOUCH TOUCHING THIS OTHER TYPE OF METAL,NO BECAUSE IT THE LOOKS LIKE THAT I THE METAL ON THE INSIDE MUST BE TOUCH TOUCH ING THIS OTHER TYPE OF METAL

553,ABOUT TURNING ON AND OFF A MAGNET,H THE BOUT TURNING ON AND OFF A MAGNET
554,UM THERE'S A SWITCH A D CELL BATTERY AND AN ELECTROMAGNET S AND IT LOOKS LIKE A METAL POLE THINGY,UM THERE IS A SWITCH A DO CELL BATTERY AND ELECTROMAGNETS O SIT AND IT LOOKS LIKE UH METAL PALTHINY
555,UM WELL IT HAS UM SO THE MORE WRAPS AROUND THAT ELECTROMAGNET THE STRONGER IT'LL BE SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS ABOUT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LIKE TWENTY WRAPS I'M NOT SURE I THINK SO,UM WEWELL IT HAS UM SO THE MALL RAPS AROUND THAT ELECTROMAGNET THE STRONGLLD B SO IT LOOK LOOKS LIKE THAOSE A BELL LIKE TWENTY RAPS IAMD NOT SHALL I THINK SO
556,UM WELL I THINK IT'S JUST THE SAME PICTURE UM JUST ROTATE IT DOWN TO YOUR EYE LEVEL UM SO I THINK THE SAME THING'S GOING ON,UM WEELL I THINK IT'S JUST THE SAME PICTRAL UM JUST THE OT TATED DOWN TOL YOUR I LEVLE UM SO I THINK THE SAME THING'S GOING ON
557,WELL SO IF YOU WANT A STRONGER MAGNET YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE UM WRAPS WELL HOW WE'RE DOING IT IS WE HAVE A WIRE AND A UM NAIL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND THE NAIL AND WE HAVE A SWITCH AND A D CELL BATTERY AND WE TURN ON AND OFF THE CIRCUIT AND THE ELECTROMAGNET,WELL SO IF YOU WANT A STRONG G MAGNET YOU NEED TO HAVE  UM WRAP S WELL HOW WELL DOING IT IS TH WE HAVE A WIL AND AN UM NAIL WAND WE WRAP THE WIL AROUND THE NAIL AND WE HAVE A SWITCH IN A D CELL  BATTERY AND WE E TURN ON AND OFF THE CIRCUIT AND THEY'LEC TROMAGNETS
558,WELL IF IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S DISCONNECTED,WELL IF IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S DES CONNECTED
559,UM YOU CAN TURN ON AND OFF THE MAGNETISM UM IN JUNKYARDS THEY USE THEM TO MOVE AROUND CARS CARS I THINK,UM YOU CAN TURN ON AND OFF THE MAGNETISM UM AND JUNKALDS THEY USE THEM TO MOVE AROUND CAU ECAULS I THINK
560,ER A CIRCUIT GOT IT'S NAMED FROM A CIRCLE UM IT'S THE ELECTRICITY FLOW GOING AROUND AND AROUND IN A CIRCLE,A SCIRCUIT GOT IT'S NAME FROM A SACKALE UM IT'S THE ELECTRICITY FLOW UP GOING AROUND AND AROUND IN A CIRCLE
561,THEY COULD BE USED FOR MAKING UM I MEAN THEY COULD BE USED FOR PICKING UP PIECES OF UM METAL IF THERE WAS LIKE OR THEY COULD BE USED FOR PICKING UP TACKS OR SOMETHING,THEY COULD BE USED FALL MAKE ING UM I MEAN THEY COULD BE USED FOR TICK ME UP PIECES OF FUM METAL IF THESE LIKE ALL THEY COULD BE USED FOR PICKING UP TACALL SOMETHING
562,UM WELL IF IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT SAY YOU HAVE A LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T LIGHT UM BUT IF YOU COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT BY MAKING SURE THERE'S NO LIKE OPENINGS UM THEN IT WILL BE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,UM WELL IF IT'S NOT A COMPLEAT SOACUIT SO YOU HAVE A LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB WIAN LIGHT UM BUT IF YOU COMPLEAT THE SCOACUIT BY MAKING SO THER'S NO LIKE OPENINGS UM THEN IT WILL BE A COMPLEAT SOCKUIT
563,UM YOU CAN LIFT UP WASHERS YOU CAN LIFT UP CARS YOU CAN ATTACH IT UM TO CRANES AND LIFT UP METAL POLES I GUESS,UM YOU CAN LIF UP WASHELLS YOU CAN LIF UP CALLS YOU CAN ATTACH IT T UM VEANS AND LIFT UP METAL PALES I GESS
564,WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ELECTROMAGNET YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE A CIRCUIT IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE CIRC WELL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY OPENINGS TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT SO THE ELECTROMAGNET WILL BE ABLE TO LIFT UP STUFF,WELL IF YOU'LL GONG TO HAVE N ELECTROMAGNET YOU'LL GOING TO NEED TO HAVE A SARCIT IND ORDER TO COMPLEAT THE SO WELL YOUDA  NOT CANT BE ABL'TO HAVE ANY OPENINGS TO COMPLET THE CIRCUIT OF THE ELECTROMAGNET WILL BE ABLE TO LIFFT UP STUFF
565,YES WE HAVE DONE DRAWING LIKE THAT EXCEPT WITH A MOTOR,YES WE HAVE DON AND DROWING LIKE THAT CSEPT WITH THE MOTOL
566,UM SAY THAT THE SWITCH WAS UP THAT MEANS IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO COMPLETELY THROUGH SO IF YOU HAD IT DOWN IT WOULD GO COMPLETELY THROUGH BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY AND KEEP ON GOING IN A CIRCLE,UM SAY THAT THE SWITCH WAS UP THAT MEANS IT WOULDN'T BE ABL TO GO COMPLEATELY THRGH SO IF YOU HA DOWN IT WOULD GO COMPLEATELY THROUGH BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY AND KEEP ON GOING IN THE SACKL
567,UM I THIN THINK YOU WOULD JUST PUT TWO DOTS AND A LINE GOING THROUGH IT,UM MY E THINK YOU WOULD JUST PUT TWO DOTPS IN THE LIME GOINGTHROUGH IT
568,THE MOTOR WOULD NOT BE CONNECTED BECAUSE OF THE SWITCH IS UP SO THE MOTOR WON'T BE WORKING,IF THE MOTAL WOULD NOT BE CONNECTED BECAUSE OF THE SWITCH IES UP SO IT THE MOTOR WON'T BE WEALKING
569,UM UH MMM WELL THE MOTOR LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE UM CIRCUIT,UM WHOT M WELL THE MOTAL LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN THE PITTAL OF THE HUM SCARCUIT
570,UM A COMPLETE CIRCUIT WOULD BE THE BATTERY HOOKED UP TO LIKE A SAY A LIGHT BULB AND THEN COMING BACK TO THE BATTERY AND GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE,UM A COMPLEAT SOCK IT WOULD BE THE BATTERY HOCKET UP TO LIKE A SAY LIGHT BULB AND THEN COMING BACK TO THE BATTE BE ANG GOING AROUND IIN A SACKALL
571,UM THERE'S A SWITCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCUIT SO IF THE ME IF THE METAL IF THE METAL POLE'S TOUCHING THE M METAL IT IF THE METAL POLE'S TOUCHING THE METAL IT'LL GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND TURN ON THE MOTOR BUT IF IT'S PULLED AWAY LIKE IT IS IN THE PICTURE IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THE MOTOR WILL STOP,UM THEYLLIS Y SWITCH AND THE METAL OF THE SORCKIT SAOL IF THE I THE METAL IF THE METAL PALLES TOUCHING THE METAL IT IF THE METAL PALLS TOUCHING THE METAL ILL IT'LL GO THROUGH THE WIELANT ON ON THE MOTAL BUT IF IT'S PULLED AWAY LIKE IT ISN'T THE PICTRRL IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THE MOTORL WILL STOFF
572,A CIRCUIT IS THE ELEC THE ELECTRICITY HOW IT FLOWS,A SACUIT IS THE ELECT THE ELECTRICITY HOW IT FLOWS
573,UH YES WE DID ONE LIKE THIS EXCEPT IT ALSO HAD A SWITCH,UH YES WE DID ONE LIKE THIS XSEPTHAT ALSO HAD A SWITCH
574,UM SO THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A CIRCLE AND WHATEVER OBJECT IS THAT IS HOOKED UP TO THE BATTERY OR ELECTRIC SOURCE UM IS A ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE,UM SO THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A SACKLL AND WHAT EVER OBJECT IS THAT IS HCKED UP TO THE BATTERY O ELECTRIC SOUS UM IS FELECTRICITY WE CEE WHEN IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING AROUND AND UARCKIL
575,UM NO,UM NO
576,UM THIS CIRCUIT IS IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH INTO THE MOTOR BACK AROUND BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND KEEPS ON GOING AND EVENTUALLY THE BATTERY WILL BATTERY WILL RU RUN OUT,UM THIS CARCIT IS IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH INTO THE MOTOL BACK AROUND BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND KEEPS ON GOING AND AVENCHUALLY THE BATTY WILL BATTERY WILL UN RUN OUT
577,YOU WOULD PUT TWO DOTS AND THEN A LINE WITH A DOT AND YOU WOULD ADD A SW IF YOU ADDED A SWITCH IT WOULD UM MAKE THE THING SPIN AROUND AND THE BATTERY WOULD BE GIVING OUT ENERGY,YOU WOOLD PUT TWO DOTS AND THEN A LINE WITH THE DOT AND YOU WOULD AD A SIF YOU ADDED A SWITCH IT WOULD UM MAKE THE THING SPIN AROUND AND THE BATTELRY WOULD BE GIVING OUT ENERGY
578,A SWITCH I WILL TURN ON A CIRCUIT OR TURN IT OFF,A SWITCH IS WELL TUN ON A SCARCUIT ALL TALN IT OFF
579,GOOD,OOD
580,YES WE JUST DID A WORKSHEET ON IT,YES WE DREST IT A WALKED SHEAT ON IT
581,UM SO ONE WIRE'S ATTACHED TO ONE END OF THE CIRCUIT AND THE OTHER'S ATTACHED TO ONE END I MEAN ONE END OF THE SWITCH ONE AND THE OTHER'S ATTACHED TO ONE END OF THE SWITCH AND ONE END TO THE LIGHT BULB SO IF YOU UNATTA ATTACH UM I MEAN IF YOU OPEN THE SWITCH THE LIGHT BULB WILL STOP BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT ISN'T THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T GOING COMPLETELY THROUGH,UM SO ONE WIZL IS ATTACH TO ONE END OF THE SARCUIT AND THE OTHERS ATTACH TO ONE AND I MEAN ONE END OF THE SWITCH ONE AND THE OTHERS ATTACH TO ONE END OF THE SWITCH IN ONE END TO THE LIGHT BULB SO IF YOU UN A TETACH UM I MEAN IF YOU OPENE THE SWITCH THE LIGHT BULB WILL STOP BECAUSE THE SALCKUIT IS THE THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T GO ING COMPLEATLLIL
582,YOU CAN UNPLUG ONE WIRE FROM THE BATTERY,YOU CAN UMPLOGE ONE WIL FROM THE BATTERY
583,UM YOU CAN PULL THE SWITCH AWAY FROM THE OTHER PIECE OF METAL AND IT'LL STOP,UM YOU CAN PULL THE SWITCH A WAY FROM THE OTHER PIECE OF METAL AND ITALL STOP
584,YES,ES
585,UH YES WE HAVE,YES WE HAVE
586,UM WE ARE UH DOING STUFF WITH CIRCUITS LIKE WE HAVE TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT AND A MOTOR WORK,UM WE ALL U DOING STUFF WITH SOCK GETS LIKE WE HAVE TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT AND A MOTDULL WOALLK
587,UM THAT THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW COMPLETELY THROUGH IN ORDER TO IN ORDER FOR THE UM ENERGY RECEIVER TO UM WORK,UM THAT THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW COMPLEATLY THROUGH IN ALITTLE TO AND OITL FRORF THE UM ENERGRY WE SCEE WELL TO UM WOALK
588,THE CIRCUIT WILL STOP WORKING AND THE LIGHT BULB WON'T LIGHT UP,THE SOACK IT WILL STOP WAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB WON'T LIGHT UP
589,I DON'T KNOW YOU TELL ME,I DON'T KNOW YOU TELL ME
590,MAYBE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH,MAYBE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH
591,THE LIGHT IS GOING TOWARD THE D CELL AND OUT OF THE END OF IT AND THE ELECTRICITY SENDS THROUGH AND ONTO THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM IT,THE LIGHT IS GOING TARDS THE D CELL AND OUT THE END OF IT AND THE ELECTRICITY SENDS THROUGH AND ON TO THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM IT
592,THE BATTERIES HELP THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND ONTO THE LIGHT BULB,THE BATTERY ELT THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND ONTO THE LIGHT BULB
593,THE STUFF THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WIRES IS ELECTRICITY THE WAS HOOKED TO THE TO THE D CELL AND WENT THROUGH THE WIRE AND ONTO THE LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT PROTECTS THE,THE STUFF THAT TRAVELS FROGH THE WRIRES IS THE ELECTRICITY THAT I WLL LOOK TO THE TO THE D CELL AND ENE THROGH THE WIRE AND ON TO THE LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT PROTECT TY YAYA
594,WELL WHAT I SEE IS I SEE THESE BLUE LITTLE DOTS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB HAS TWO DOTS THAT ARE SURROUNDING THE WIRES THAT ARE IN IT,WELL WHAT I SEE IS I SEE THESE BLUE LITTLE DOTS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB HAS TWO DOTS SIDE IF SURROUNDING THE WIRE'S ATTORIN T
595,WHAT I NOTICE IS THAT EVERY TIME I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT TURNS THE OPPOSITE WAY OF WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE,WHAT I NOTICE IS THAT EVERY TEMIC CLICK ON THE D CELL IT TURNS THE OPPAUSIT WAY OF WHAT IT'SOPOSED TO BE
596,LEFT,IS
597,HOW ARE YOU DOING,HOW ARE YOU DOING
598,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
599,THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH FLOWING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,THERE IS NOW ELECTRICITY GOWING THROUGH OF FLOWING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
600,IT WOULDN'T I DON'T THINK IT WOULD PRODUCE LIGHT,IT WOULDN'T I DON'T THINK IT WULD PRODUCE LIGHT
601,A LITTLE BLUE AROUND CIRCLE SURROUNDS THE ENDINGS OF THE WIRE,A LITTLE BLUE AROUND CIRCLE SUROUNDSTANDIMS OF THE WIRE
602,I NOTICE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY WHICH YOU JUST TOLD AND THEN I CAN SEE THEM GOING THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND OUT THE OTHER AND IT'S OBSERVING THE LIGHT AND MAKING THE LIGHT SHINE ON THE LIGHT BULB,I NOW TICED THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS IT ORF THE ELECTRICITY WHICH YOU JUST TOLD ME AND THEN I CAN SEE THEM GOING THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND OFF THE OTHER AND IT'S ABSORBING THE LIGHT AND MAKING THE LIGHT SHIN ON THE LIGHT BULB
603,IT IT IS VERY COOL AND I AND I CAN SEE IT'S GOOD HOW YOU EXPLAINED HOW THE LITTLE THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRICITY AND IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT TAKES OUT ALL THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL AND BRINGS IT OUT THE OTHER THE OTHER END OF IT AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY IN THE LIGHT AND MAKES THE LIGHT SHINE,IT IS STED OF VERY COL AND EAND I CAN SEE ITS GOOD HOW YOU EXPLAINE HOW THE LITTLE THE BLUE DOTS IS E ELECTRICITY AND IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT TAKES OUT ALL THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL AND BRINGS IT OUT THE OTHER THE OTHER END OF IT INT PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY AND THE LIGHT AND MAKES THE LIGHT SHINE
604,ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE BUT THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL SO THE D CELL HAS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT PUTS IT THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND SHINES ITS LIGHT,ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE BUT THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL SO THE D CELL HAS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT PUTS IT THROUGH THE WIRE AND ENTO THE LIGHT BULB AND SHINES IT'S LIGHT

691,WHAT,WA OLA
692,BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO WITH JUST ONE ENERGY CELL,BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO WIT JUST ONE D CELL
693,ONLY ONE OF THEM WILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY,ONLY ONE OF THEM WILL LIGHT UPT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT EN EP ELECTRICITY
694,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM,WE A'VE BEEN LERINGNE ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM
695,THERE'S TWO REASONS BECAUSE NEGATIVE CAN'T THE NEGATIVE SIDE CAN'T GO THROUGH AND THEN COME OUT COME INTO NEGATIVE SIDE AGAIN AND ALSO THE TWO THERE'S TWO THERE'S THE TWO D CELLS ARE HOOKED ONTO EACH OTHER FROM BOTH SIDES,BE THERE'S TWO RNS BECAUSE NEGATIVE CAN'T THE NEGATIVE SIDE CAN'T GO THROUGH AND THEN CMCOM INTO NEAGATIVE AGAIN IN ALL SO THE TWO THERE'S TWO CUM THERE'S THE TWO D CELLS ARE HOOKED ON TO EACH OTHER FROM BOTH SID
696,I THINK BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP BETTER BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY,I THINK BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS WI LIGHT UP BETTER BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY
697,THEY'RE BOTH LIT UP BUT THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE NOT REALLY THEY'RE NOT LIGHT HOW AS LIGHT AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THEY'RE REALLY REALLY DIM,THEY'RE BOTH LIT UP BUT THEY'RE DME THEY'RE NOT REALLY THEY'RE NOT LIGHT HOW AS LIGHT AS THE SUR SURPOSED TO BE THER REALLY REALLY DEME
698,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
699,EVERY TIME I CLICK ON IT IT CHANGED THE ONE SIDE OF A D CELL AND TURNED IT THE RIGHT WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO SUPPOSED TO BE AND WHEN YOU TURN IT THAT WAY THERE'S ELECTROMAGNETISM COMING THROUGH ONE SIDE AND THEN GOING OUT THE OTHER SO IT MAKES MORE ELECTRICITY AND WHEN YOU MAKE MORE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP,EVERY TIME I CLICK ON IT IT CHANGE T ONE SIDE OF A D CELL AND TURNED  THE RIGHTE WAY IT SURPOSEED IT SRPOSED TO BE AND WHEN YOU TURN IT THAT WAY THI IS ELECTRF MAGNET MAGNETISM COMING THROUGH ONE SIDE AND THEN GOING OUT THE OTHER SO IT MAKES MORE ELECTRICITY AND LIGHT MORE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT OP
700,EACH SIDE OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE AND THE AND THE POSITIVE AND ON THE BOTTOM IT HAS TO TOUCH THE CORE OF IT AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB,EACH SIDE OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE AND THE POT AND THE POSITIVE AND ON THE BOTTOM IT HAS TO TOUCH THE CHLOR OIT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB
701,WELL WE DID A PROJECT OF THIS THE OTHER DAY AND WE HAD A QUESTION ON OUR WORD WALL WHAT IF WE HAD TWO LIGHT BULBS COULD WE MAKE BOTH OF THEM LIGHT UP WITH THE CIRCUIT AND SOME PEOPLE SAID YES AND SOME PEOPLE SAID NO BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY DID IT ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB LIT UP BECAUSE THAT IT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH D CELL ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH AND ON TO THE BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS,WELL WE DID A PROJECT OF THIS AT OTHER DAY AND WHEN WE DID IT WE WE HAD A CLESCHION ON OUR WORD WHAL WHUT IF WE HAD TWO LIGHT BULBS COULD WE MAKE BOTH OF THEM LIGHT UP WITH THE CIRCUIT AND SOME PEOPL SAID YS OF SOME PEOPLE SAID NO BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY DID IT ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UHT BECAUSE THAT IF THERE WASN'T A AH UP UM TE SOL ELECTRICITY JS FLOW THROUGH AND ON TO THE BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
702,THERE HAS TO BE FULL COMPONENTS TO DO A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,THERE HAS TO BE CER COMPONENTS TO DO A COMPLEAT CIRCUIT
703,IF YOU TURN ONE D CELL AROUND AND A NEGATIVE WOULD FACE ONE DIRECTION AND THE AND THE OTHER AND THE PLUS SIGN WOULD FACE THE OTHER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TWO TWO COMPONENTS FACING THE SAME DIRECTION THEN THE TWO D CELL COMPONENTS WILL NOT THERE WON'T BE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BATTERIES IN THEM AND IN THE BACK,LL IF YOU TURN FONE D CELL AROUND AN ANEGATIVE WULD TH S ONE DEIRECTION AND THE AND THE OTHER N AND THE FRONM THE PESIN WOULD FASE THE OTHER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TWO TWO COMPOWNENTS FASING THE SAME DIRECTIONTHEN THE TWO D CELL COMPONENTS WILL NOT THEYRE WON'T BE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BATTERIYS AND THEM AND IN THE BAT
704,A CIRCUIT IS ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM,A CIRCUIT IS ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM

707,THEY'RE ALL AN ENERGY SOURCE,THEY'RE ALL AN ENERGY SOURCE
708,THEY'RE ALL TOUCHING EACH SIDE OF THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES LIKE ON THE BATTERY IT HAS THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDES AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH IT CAN'T IF YOU USE THE BATTERIES IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COME OUT AND COME OUT OF THE NEGATIVE,THEY'RE ALL TOUCHING IT SIDE OF THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES LIKE ON THE BATTERY IT HAS THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDES AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH IT CAN'T IF YOU USE THE BATTERYS OIT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COME OUT AND COME OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
709,THE D CELL THE AND THE TWO LIGHT BULBS,THE D CELL B AND THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
710,THAT IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO EACH OBJECT AND INTO EACH COMPONENT AND IT GOES IT COMES IN IT GOES OUT THE NEGATIVE AND THROUGH IT TOUCHES THE CORE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS AND IT GOES IN THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT FLOWS OUT THE BOTTOM AND THE SAME PATTERN GOES AFTER THE OTHER AND COMES AROUND AND GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY,THAT IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO EACH OBJECT AND ENANDTO EACH COMPONENT AND COS IT COMES IN IT GOS OUT THE NEGATIVE AND THROUGH IT TOUCHES THE COR OF THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS AND IT GOES IN THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT FLOWS OUT THE BOTTOM AND THE SAME PATTEROAN GOES OFTHOR THE OTHER AND COMES AROUND AND GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OUT THE BATTERY
711,I DON'T I DON'T KNOW,UM I DON'T I DON'T KNOW
712,THE PATHWAY IS WHERE THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THE CIRCUIT IS WHEN EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED BUT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH A POSITIVE AND COME OUT THE NEGATIVE,THE PATHWAY IS WHERE THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THE CIRCUILT IS WHEN EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED BUT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH A POSITIVE AND COMOUT TO NEGATIVE
713,BOTH BULBS LIT UP AND THEY WERE BOTH,THS BOB SLIT UP AND NAIRGOR BOTH

1248,THERE'S UM SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THEN A WASHER'S GOING INTO THE UM UM THE CUP,THERE IS UM SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE WASHERS GOING IN TO THE UM UM THE CUP
1249,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER
1250,THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE UM THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AREN'T AS UM STRONG,THE MORE SPASCERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE UM THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNENTS ARAN IS UM STRONG
1251,UM WELL WHEN Y WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GONNA PU IT'S GONNA PROBABLY BREAK MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNET,UM WELL WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GAN UF PH IT'S GONTU PROBABLY BREAKE MORE EASELLY BECAUSE OF THE SPASCERS AND BETWEEN THE MAGNETS
1252,WHEN THERE'S SPACE BETWEEN UM THE MAGNETS UM THE FORCE ISN'T AS STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASILY,WHEN THERE IS SPASE BETWEEN UM THE MAGNETS UM THE FORCE ISN'T A STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASALLY
1253,THERE'S A BIGGER UM LIKE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM WHEN THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,THERE 'S A BIGER UM LIKE SPASE BETWEEN TUM WHEN THEY'RERE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
1254,N GROUP A B AND D UM THE WASHERS ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND IN GROUP C THEY'RE JUST KINDA SCATTERED AROUND THE CUP,IN GROUP AYB AND D UM THE WASHERS ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND IN GROUP SCE THEY'RE JUST KIND OF SKATTERD AROUND THE CUP
1255,WELL IN GROUP C THERE'S ONLY FI IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WASHERS WITH N ZERO SPACERS AND IN A B AND D IT ALL THEY TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS,WELL IN GROOUP CEE THERE 'S ONLY FIVE IT ONLY TOCK FIVE WASHERS WITH SERIAL SPASCERS AND IN AB AND D IT ALL THEY TOCK NINETEEN WASHERS
1256,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS IN THERE TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS IN THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRIED TO BREAK THE FORCE AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPACER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAK THE FORCE,USED THE VALANTS AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS AND THEY WEIT TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS AND THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRYE TO BREAKE THE FORCE AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS THAT TOCK TO BREAKE THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPASCER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPASCERS OFTR YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAKE THE FORCE
1257,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE PASCERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES
1258,BYE SEE YOU TOMORROW,BYE SEE YOU TO MOAROLW
1259,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER UM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT IS A UM THAT THE SPACER IS IN BETWEEN,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER UM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT O THE UM THAT THE SPASCER ISIN BETWEEN
1260,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM MAGNETS AND THEY SEEING HOW HOW F UM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,E'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM MAGNETS AND THEY THING HOW HOW UM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFOUR THE FORCE BREAKES
1261,UM IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK,UM IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK
1262,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BR HOW MANY WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BUT HOW MANY WASHES YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKES
1263,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS ARE THE FORCE IS LEA IT'S UM WEAKENING,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS ARE THE FORCEES  IT'S UM WEAKNNING
1264,UM THE MORE WASHERS THAT YOU ADD THE EASIER OR WHEN THE THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE LE IT'S NOT AS STRONG SO THEY BREAK APART,UM THE MORE WASHERS THE YOU ADD THE EASIER URE WHEN THE THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE WE IT'S NOT IS STRONG SO THEY BREAKE APART
1265,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE UM ER AND THEN WE WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG IT HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BROKE,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPASCERS BETWEEN THE UM  AND THEN WE WUSED A BALANCE AN THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG IT HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFOR THE FORE SPROK
1266,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1267,IT'S LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM AND IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LON HOW THE FORCE HOW MU HOW BY TOGETHER THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE FOR THERE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE,'S LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS WHEN THEY HAVE SPASE BETWEEN THEM AND IT'S ALL SO SING UM HOW LONG HOW THE FORCE HOW HOW CLOSE TOGETHER THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE FOR THEIRE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE
1268,WE USE THE BALANCE AND WE PUT LIKE SPACE UH WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONE SIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS IN IT AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AH AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPACERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK BEFORE THE B FORCE BROKE,USED THE BAOLANCE AND WE PUT LIKE SPASE UF WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONESIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS AN THE AND THEN WE PUT SPASERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS  AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPASCERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TUCK BEFOR THE FORCE BROK
1269,WELL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STICK THEY JUST LIKE PUSHED APART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALMOST NO WAY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PUT 'EM TOGETHER THEY'D GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UM SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORCE THERE,LL WHEN THEY DIDN'T WAN'T A STICK THEY JUST LIKE PUSH THA PART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALLMOST NO WAY TO PUSH THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRYED TO PUT THM TOGETHER THEY GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WAN'T TO U SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORCE THERE
1270,E REASON ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO G GET THAT IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TOO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE MA THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK,REEASEN ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GET THAT IT IS'T STRONG ENOGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH AULT THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK
1271,MARNIE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER,MARNIE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO ILL TALK TOU LATER
1272,GOODBYE MARNIE,GOOD BYE MARNIE
1273,UM THERE IS A LIKE A THERE'S LIKE UH THEY COULD LIKE STICK THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT COULD PULL 'EM TOGETHER AND THERE'S A FORCE THAT COULD PUSH 'EM APART,THERE IS A LIKE  THERES LIKE THEY COULD LIKE STICK THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT COULD PULL THEM TOGETHER AND THERE'S A FORCE THAT COULD PUSH HIM APART
1274,OH THE ELEC UM THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CLIP MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET,OH THE ELEC UM THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CALIS MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET
1275,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1276,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IS IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP STAYS AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM,WELL THE DOLL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPARARY MAGNET AND A TEMPARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT S THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP STAYS AND THIS IS CALLD TEMPEORARY MAGNETISM
1277,UM WE'VE BEEN UH LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS,UM WE'VE BEEN  LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1278,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THERE IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART,SUOMAR TURN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOMEARTURNES THE OPASIT WAY SO THE IS A FORCED THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART
1279,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UH USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT 'EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE U USE FOR LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT UNS UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT  OBJECT PUTTWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UH MAGNETS BUT WEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUFF THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK
1280,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROSS THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SENS THE MAGNETISM ISTILL IN THEIR IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
1281,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1282,WELL W WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN 'EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN 'EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT THE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WOR THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE,WELL WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACHETHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY AT TRACT THEY IF YOU TURN THM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH F PART BUT IF YOU TURN UM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEYR WRIGHT THE IN THE WRIGHT WAY SOM THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE
1283,WELL THEY'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT 'EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO LI IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO,WELL THERE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE COULD BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT IUM THROUGH SOMETHINGS IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGF THEN IT WON'T GO BUT IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WOAN'T IT TO
1284,AGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL,AM IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL
1285,THERE'S A FORCE THAT PU THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS 'EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER,E'S A FORCE THERE I THAT PUL THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS THEM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE AT TRACT TOGETHER IF SENS THE'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULDN'T MOVE IT AROUND SONS THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER
1286,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET MEANS IT'LL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,UM IT'S BECAUSE H TO DAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THEY RE THE UM THE DOLL MAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALED A TEMPERY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET IT MEANS THAT IT WILL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A CUPPLE MINUTS
1287,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOME THICK THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOME THING'S IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE,I'VE ABSIRVED THAT SOME THIK THINGWAS CAN UM LIKE SOMETHING THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THAND THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOMETHINGS IF THE'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THEIRE
1288,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETI THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND IT'LL STAY ON THE NAIL,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNET THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND THE IT'LLE STAY ON THE NAIL
1289,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT N IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT IT'S ON IT AND THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET,UH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGMENT ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AD TICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THTHE MAIL IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANET  IT'S NOT A PERMANET UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME T'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT MAGNET IT'S ON IT AND THEN THAT MAKES THE NAIL AT TEMPERY MAGNET
1290,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
1291,UM WELL THE THICKNESS IF WE IF IT'S TOO THICK AND THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE IRON OR STEEL THEN UM IT'LL,IF IT'S NOT A STRONG ENOUFF THEN IT WON'T WORK AND IT WON'T GO THROUGH THE THICK NES BUT IF IT'S THICK ENUF IF IT'S NOT TOO THICK THEN IT WILL GO UM THEN IT WILL GO RIGHT IT'LL GO THE RIGHT WAYTHEN IT WILL KEEP SING
1292,THE LONG SILVER OBJECT IS UM IT'S CALLED A DULL NAIL AND UM AND THERE'S A UM THERE'S A LIKE A MAG THE MAGNET IS LIKE SENDING MAGNETISM THROUGH THE DULL NAIL AND IT'S GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP IT'S GOING TO THE PERRY CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING TO IT IT'S ATTRACTING THIS PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NAIL INSTEAD OF IT HAVING TO STICK EXACTLY TO THE MAGNET,HE LONG SOLVEAR OBJECT IS UM IT'S CALLD A DOLL NAIL AND UM AND THERE IS  UM THERE IS  LIKE A MAGTHE MAGNET IS LIKE SENDING MAGNETISM THROUGH THE DOL NAIL AND IT'S GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP IT'S GOING TO THE PARY CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING TO IT IT'S ATRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NAIL INSTEAD OF IT HAVING TO STICK EX
1293,GOODBYE MARNIE I NEED TO TALK I CAN TA,OODBYE MINIE I MEAN TO TALK OF INDE
1294,WELL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT'LL BE THE LIGHT BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER,WELL I BECAUSE THERE'S MARE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT WILL BE THE LIGHT BUL WILL BE BRIGHTER
1295,WELL THE WHOLE FLOW STOPS,WELL THE HOLL FLOW STOPS
1296,IF ONE BULB BURMS OUT THEN THEY BOTH THE UM THE OTHER BU THE OTHER BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THE OTHER KIND OF CIRCUIT THEN THEY THEY'D BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH THE SAME UM ENER THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THEY BOTH THE UM THE OTHER BUT THE OTHER BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THE OTHER KIND OF CIRCUIT THEND THEY THEY BOTH BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH THE SAME UM END THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT ENERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY
1297,WELL WELL IT ALL STOPS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE MMM BECAUSE Y ONE DIES OUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT SO IF YOU CLICK ON IT THEN THAT MEANS BOTH OF THEM WILL DIE OUT BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THE THE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE SECOND ONE IT'LL KEEP GOING SO UH BECAUSE IT'S DEAD AND IT CAN GO THROUGH THE SECOND ONE,WELL WELL IT ALL STOP S PRAIGTING MUCH BECAUSE BECAUSE  ONE DIZHES OUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT SO IF YOU CLICK ON IT THEN THAT MEANS BOTH OF THEM WILL DYE OUT BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THE THE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE SECOND ONE IT WILL KEEP GOING SO UM BECAUSE IT'S DEAD AND IT CAN GO THROUGH THE SECON WON
1298,WELL YOU COULD REALLY USE BOTH OF 'EM BUT IF YOU USE UM A SERIES CIRCUIT THEN UM THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GONNA BE MORE DIM BUT IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE AS DIM,WELL YOU COULD REALLY USE BOTH OF THEM BUT IF YOU USE UM A SERIES CIRCUIT THEN UM THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GONG TO BE MORE DEM BUT IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THEY'R PROBABLY WON'T BE AS DEM
1299,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUIT
1300,WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE THEY DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST UM UP AND THROUGH SO YEAH,WELL THERE 'ISN'T THEY NT THEYRE THEIRE OU DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST UM UP AND THROUGH SOYEAH
1301,WELL WHEN YOU BURN OUT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOSTLY THEY BOTH GO OFF,WELL HEN YOU BURN OUT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOST LY THEY'R BOTH GO OFF
1302,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THEN IT WON'T WORK VERY GOOD,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THE WON'T WORK TH VATTERY GOOD
1303,WELL IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR UM A CIR A LONG STRING A LIGHTS IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE AS UH UH THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS BRIGHT,WELL IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR UM A CIRCULONG STRING OF LIGHTS I'S PROBABLY NOT GONTO B AS UM THEY'RE NOT GONG TO BE AS BRIGHT
1304,IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IN AE SERIES CIRCUIT THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY
1305,PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY HAVE TWO,PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY HAVE TO
1306,MARNIE,MARNIE
1307,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1308,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1309,WELL THERE IS ON THERE'S ONLY W UM ONE PA UH THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THE THEY'RE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER,WELL THERE IT'S ONLY THERE'S ONLY UM ONE PUHM THERE 'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THE THERE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
1310,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY
1311,I DISCOVERED THAT UM IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIGHT IS THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME,I DESCUOVERD THAT IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIGKE IS THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME
1312,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S A TWO PATHWAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE'S ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BULBS,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S A TWO PATH WAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE 'I'S ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BOBS
1313,DIFFERENCES UM IS THAT THE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE SAME AND THEY'RE LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE IT'S THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ENOUGH ENERGY,DIFFERENCE IS UM IS THAT THE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE SAME AND THEY'RE LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE HI'S THEYRE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ANOUFFH ENERGY
1314,BECAUSE THEN YOUR STRINGS WILL BE LIGHTER AND WHEN THERE'S MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE LIGHT,BECAUSE THE OUR STRINGS WILL BE LIGHTER AND WHEN THERE'S MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE LIGHT
1315,WELL THE ONE THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS,WELL THE WONE WELH THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS
1316,WELL IT H IT'S BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS A DEAD BATTERY IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE IT'S BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COULDN'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON,WELL IT IT'S BECAUSE M THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS THA DEAD BATTERY IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE  BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COULD'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON
1317,I'M AWESOME,MOSUM
1318,UM WELL THEY'RE GOING THROUGH LIKE UM THEY GO AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THEY GO OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH AND THEN IN,UM WELL THEY'RE GOING THROUGH LIKE UM THEY GO AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THEY GO OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH AND THEN IN
1319,THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YOU'RE SEPARATING THE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER,THE WATER GOES THROUGHTHE SCREN BUT THE ROCK STAY AND TOP OF IT SERS SEPARATNG THE WATE THE WROCKS FROM THE WATE
1320,CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SIEVE BUT THE WATER AND THE MUD CAN,CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN'T GET TROUGH THE SEE BUT THE WATER AND THE MOD CAN
1321,THE THE UM SALT IS THE THAT THE THING IS THE BEST FOR THAT ONE BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES IT'S USING EVAPORATION TO GET RID OF THE WATER SO YOU CAN GET IT APART SO YOU JUST HAVE THE SALT,THE THE UM SALTIS THE THAT THE THING IS THE BEST FOR THAT WONE BECAUSE IT AVAPARATES IT'S USING AVAPARATION TO GET RID OF THE WATER S LOUH CAN GET IT APART SO IT JUST HAVE THE SALT

1324,I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH,I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHAT EVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH
1325,GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS UM ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNET,THE GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS UM ARTRACTED TO MAGNET
1326,I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION I THINK IT'S A MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT LITTLE BIT OF MIXTURE,I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE KIND OF SOLUTION I THINK IT'S A MOSTLY SOLUTION BUT LITTLE BILB MIXTURE
1327,BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICLE SIZES SO THAT THE ROCKS,BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICAL SIZE SO THAT THE ROCKS
1328,MIXTURES AREN'T ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER,MIXTURES AN AR WHEN YOU MIX TWO SSUBSTANCES AR MORE TOGETHER

1535,THAT THE SWITCH IS CLOSED SO THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET TO MAKE THE WASHERS ATTRACT TO THE RIVET STEEL,THAT THE SWITCH IS CLOWSE SO THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE STEEL RIBBET TO MAKE THE WASHERS ATTRACT TO THE RIBITSTEL
1536,I DON'T,I DON'T
1537,THAT THE WIRE IS GETTING WRAP IS WRAPPED AROUND THE STEEL RIVET AND IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY,THAT THE WIRE IS GETTING WRAP IS WRAPED AROUND THE STO RIBING ANDITCONNECTIE CHILTHE SWIDGE TO THE D CELL BA
1538,TO MEAN THAT THE MAGNET THE STEEL RIVET WOULDN'T ACTUALLY LAST THAT LONG BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MAGNET,TEMPERIY MAGMATS MEN THAT THE MAGNET THE STEL RIBIT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY LAST THAT LONGBCAUSE IT'S NOT AMAGNET
1539,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,A PAR LELLCI
1540,BYE,BYE
1541,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW ENERGY SHOULD,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW ENERGY SURE
1542,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BECAUSE THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BECAUSE THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
1543,THE ENERGY CAN FLOW TO THE OTHER ONE,THE ENERGY CAN FLOW TO THE OTHER ONE
1544,UHM IT DOESN'T REALLY END UP,UH IT DOSTHER EPAING AND
1545,IT ALL STOPS,IGHTIT ALL STOP
1546,THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME,THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT CAUSEWHAT'S YOUR NAME
1547,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BACK TO THE,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BACK TO THE B
1548,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ON THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY BECAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ONM THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY CAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
1549,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BURN OUT IT TURNS INTO AN OPEN CIRCUIT,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BURND OUT IT'STURNTING TOG AN OPEN CIRCUIT
1550,INTO THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTO,TIL THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTOA
1551,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK,BECAUSE ONE THE'RE BOTH SHEIRRING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKES OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WOR
1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANYTHING
1553,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SIO THE FILIMENT
1554,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A,YOU SEERIE CIRCUIT GOES  AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A
1555,THAT THREE WIRES ON SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE,THAT THE THREE WIRES ON ONE SIDE IS SHOING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE'RE'S SHERING THAT ENERGY OF THE BATT
1556,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK,I THING TIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILLAMENT BREAKES THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WILLT WORK
1557,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKAN FOLIMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS
1558,I KNOW THAT THEY'RE PARALLEL LINES,I NOW THAT THER PARALLEL LIGHT
1559,THE SECOND CIRCUIT,THE SECAND CIRCUI
1560,GOOD,GOOD
1561,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH,THAT THA SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING E CAN FLOW THRU
1562,THEN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT'S NOT BURNT OUT,AN ENERGY WOULE ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT IS NOT BURNED OUT
1563,WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS,WHEN THE SUNAIT BREAKS LILK
1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,WE HAVE NAI S THOMXCOV
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS WARS SHARING ENERG
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,TAL FM IT'S WORKING AND ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONE'S IF YOU GET ARRIGHT FILLMAK THE BULB MAKI YOU BULB WHICH ITS WORKING
1567,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THE FILLAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY HAIVLS
1569,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME N A FHASE SO CAN WE HORY UP
1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT THE END
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE A SWITH IS
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,THAT SENS TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULBENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,I MUST HAVE THE ENERGY CUD STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE ECOUSE YHHA AND HAT THAT ADAT THE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT
1574,I DON'T KNOW,YAHN
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BL
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,WELL THEN DO THAT WHEN THE BULBS BURN OU'T I DON'T NOW IT'S NOT I PROVLE
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,FY CIRAUITSSL SETS CAN ARE A BIG THIRCLE PLUCK A HININ PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINAF CIRCUITS

1585,ONE LIGHT BULB'S HAVING TOO,ONE LIGHT BULB IS HAVING TO MO
1586,THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED TO THE D CELL,A RONK CONNECTE TO THE D CHELL
1587,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATH WAYS EAXSEPT ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKAN FILLIMENT AND THE OTHER DOESNT SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH WA
1588,THAT ONE OF THEM IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILAMENT IS,THAT ONE OF THAT IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILLIMENT IS BUR
1589,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S AWESOME,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS OUA
1590,BECAUSE THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT,BECAUSE A SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT
1591,STOP STOPS GLOWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB,STOP IT STOPS WROWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB
1592,THAT,ABOUT
1593,WE TOOK SOME STEEL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ATTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE TUCK SUME STEEL UM NAILES AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH ITS ETRACT AND WHEAT WOULDN'T
1594,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP,YOU HAD TO TAKE EATHER THE CUMPISS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRYE USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE CUMPISS WOULD PINT NOR TOARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEELL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COM UP
1595,THEY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE,IT DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAPING THINGS ALLSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UN DUN
1596,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL TIMES BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
1597,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANY WERF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROT IT UP
1598,THE NAILS AND THE PAPER CLIP,THE NAIL SAND THE PAPER CLIP
1599,SINCE THEY ATTRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS,ANTS THEY ETRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES PENDING APON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABALS AND OTHER THINGS
1600,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT
1601,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STAL OR METAL STUFF
1602,O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO,O THAT THE N HELP JRESST KIND OF DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
1603,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF F WOULD C WOULD MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF WOULD CUM HEN MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT TEY CULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF
1604,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
1605,AND THE ROCK THE S STEEL ROCK,AND THE ROCK THE SSTEEAL ROCK
1606,YES,YES
1607,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE N NET THE NAIL DID,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE NET THE NAIL DID
1608,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM STAY LIKE THA,WHEREEVER YOU PUTH THE MAGNETS THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPASIT SIDE THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM STAY LIKE T
1609,YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THEY'LL DEPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,YES BECAUSE CAR BORD THICK CAR BORD IT CAN GO THROUGH THINK CAR BORD BUT THICK CAR BORD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE THING PENDING APON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS
1610,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICK WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON VILANS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T
1611,THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET,E OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
1612,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
1613,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE TH THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T G ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT WRES THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARBBORD SO THEY COULDN'T ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE PIECE OF PAPEROR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
1614,WE HAVE PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK S STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ONTO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT,WE HAVE PUT THEEM AND BOCKES AND THEN TOCK S STELE SHAPINGS AND A CUMPIS TO TRY TO FIND EMTHAT OTHER PEPL MADE ECAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICK TO STOCK TAPE ON TO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT
1615,GOOD,GOOD
1616,YEAH SOMETIMES,YEAH SOMETIMES
1617,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND M ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY BY LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND IT MON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY CLOE LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOULL NOW
1618,TTRACTED EACH OTHER,ACTED EACH OTHER
1619,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNETS RUBBED ON TH THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNE IT MAKES IT M A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THEY WILL STRICK BECAUSE SENS THE MAGNETS WRUBPED ON THE THE S EL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT CENS THEY WRUBP TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SCOME OF THE MAGAND H IT MAKES IT A BIT MAGNETIZED SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
1620,IT IT STUCK ON ONTO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK T AS WELL,IT IT STUCK OM ON TO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKE TO NOUER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK TO AS WELL
1621,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WA MAYDE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAD WOOLD COME TOGETHER WITH AN WHAT WOULDN'T
1622,THEY'RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER,THEY ARE ETRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN CUME TOGETHER
1623,THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER,THE ETRACT OND E CELPER
1624,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS A MAGNET,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT SUNGS A MAGN
1625,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STAY LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD,WHEN THEY STO TOGETHER THEY WOULD STILL LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOOD
1626,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
1627,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS SO FIND AND YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN,IT WOULD PINT TO THE MAGNETS I O YOU COULD FIND AND YOU COULD START GOING CLOAER AND IT'LL PINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWOARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAIS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPE D IN
1628,MAGNET DID,MAGNETDID
1629,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT  IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIMY
1630,THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK,THEY ATTRACTD EACHOTHER EAVEN THEO IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CAR BORD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK

1657,WE HAD HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE CHARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY,WE HAD HAD TO WRAPP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE TARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTD AT TEN WENT TWENTY BEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENUFF WIRE FOR FIFTY
1658,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT,MORE WASHERS WOULD CUM UP WITH IT
1659,IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SWIT SWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND TO MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT THERE IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AGAIN,IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINES INE ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SSWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGN IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPED AROUND OW MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INT THE BPLUSKS OUT THE MIGNES AND ALL OVER A
1660,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MINUS SIGN WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY A LITTLE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND TO PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRY TO PICK THEM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MIGE SIDE HOW WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY THE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THE SUM THIS METTAL THINGY AND THEN WE TOK THE OTHER IDE AND PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH THOR LITTAL IRONS TRID TO PICK THIM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN TIT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB OM OFF INSTEAD
1661,YES,YES
1662,THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND INSTEAD TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE,THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND IN STAT  TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKIN UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE
1663,YES,YES
1664,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL IS IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS A MAGNET WE WOULDN'T USE WE'LL NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOMETHI A SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PICK,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRE'S THAT IT ALOUWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL IS IN VERY IMPORTAN'T BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE HOL ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE THATS MAGWE WOULDN'T USE WEULD NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNETS AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE TLECCONNECTS AND HAS ITH THAT CONNECTS IT TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USE TO PICK CTHEY WE USE AS THE PICING OM A SORCE OF SOMETHING TAY PICOUT
1665,IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS THEN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP,IF YOU WRAPP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAPP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU WILL WRAPP IT AROUND LESS THEN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP
1666,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND OUR HOU IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT SO WE DON'T TO TO PUT THEM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON ANT OFF WHICH HELPS USO WE DON'T TO GRABHM OFF THE MAGNETS WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND A IN OUR HOUSES AND  THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHTHOUT AH SO WE DON'T E TO T PUT THIM UP AND DOUN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRABBHM OFF INSTEAD
1667,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS GREAT,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS RIGHT
1668,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN NOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THARE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
1669,BECAUSE OF MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING MORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING IT A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE,BECAUSE THE MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING WTHMORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND IT'S BILDING MAKING IT'S A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK IND THE IN TO THE BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE
1670,WELL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO AS A MAGNET SO UM WE THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS,WELL WE WRAPED THE WIR AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES HN WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAGIT TURNED IN TO OF AS MAGNET SO BUT THE MORE TIMED WE WRAPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRON
1671,IT IS THE ELEC TRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK,IT IS THE ACELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT COUD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE OLLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
1672,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STONGER,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT N COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STRONGER
1673,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET,WE MAIDE AN ELECTROMAGNET
1674,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACT LIKE A NORMALE PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
1675,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND IT HOW IT'S IT NEEDS TO GET AROUND THOSE WIRES,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BEABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY AND COMOUT OF THE BATTERY AND HOW IT'S PUTINNEEDS TO GET AROUND THESE WIRS
1676,I SEE THAT UHM THE WASHERS JUST GOT PICKED UP,I SEE THAT THE WASHERS JU STOP PICK UP
1677,BECAUSE ENERGY MUST BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND ENERGY KIND OF I DON'T KNOW,US ENERGY MUST BE FAI THROUGH AND ENERGY CSI ALL NOW
1678,THAT IT LOOKS LIKE UHM THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY COOL AND UHM THERE'S ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT GOES OUT,I'S THAT IT LILIKE UM THE ENERGY JUST CEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AT KINOF IT LOOKS FEREALLY COALL AND UM THERE I'S ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND COR OUE AND OTHER PART THAT GOES OUT
1679,UHM UHM YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOU'RE ABLE ACTUALLY MAKE A MAGNET TO TURN IT ON AND OFF,UM YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOURE OUILL TAUCHALY MAKE A MAGNET WHERE ABL TO FIT ON A NO
1680,THE RIVET MUST BE STEEL,RITHAT MUST BE STILL
1681,GOOD HOW ARE YOU,GOOD HOW OUT YOU
1682,UHM THAT IT PICKED UP THE UHM WHAT UHM,ON THAT I PICK  UP THE UM THWAGKE WAH UM
1683,IS ABLE TO TURN ON THE MAGNET ON AND OFF SO IF YOU TURN IT OFF THERE UHM UHM THE WASHERS WOULD FALL OFF IF YOU KEEP IT ON THE WASHERS WILL NOT FALL OFF,THAS  ABL TO TURN ON THE MAGNET ON AND OFF SO IF ETURN IT OFF THEY ERE U THE RIVEUM THE WASHERS WAILT FALL OFF IF OU SPID ON THE WASHER WILL NOT FAL OFF
1684,YOU DO NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU WRAP UP ALL THE WIRES UHM GOOD BECAUSE I DID TRY DOING THAT BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK,YOU DO NEED TO MAKE TUR RIGHT WRAP UP ALL THE WIRES IUM GOOLD BE CIDE TO TRY DOING THAT BUT T WHEN IT WORK
1685,CLOSER NOT AN OPEN ONE TO CELL ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH,CLOW URCT AND NOT AN OPEN ONE TO SCELL ENERGY CANNOT GET THROUGH
1686,SO UHM THE ENERGY CAN GET THROUGH IT SO TIRED,SO UN THE ENERGY CULD IT THROUGH ITFITH ORFTE
1687,UHM THE RIVET ALL THAT WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVETS HI HOW ARE YOU HI HI,UM THE RIVET HA ALL THAT WIRE IS WRAPED AROUND THE RIVETS HY OR HYEHYE
1688,IT'S CLOSED IF IT'S TOUCHING THE METAL,ICLOSED IF IT'S TOUCHING THE BMETAL
1689,UHM IT'S USING ENERGY TO MAKE A MAGNET,U IT'S YUSLING ENERGY TO MAKE A MAGNET
1690,THE THE IT BECOMES A MAGNET,HE THE WEI BECOMES A MAGNET
1691,IT CAN'T PICK UP THE UHM IT CAN'T PICK UP THE WASHERS,IT CAN'T PICK UP THE UM IT CAN'T PICK UP THE WASHERS
1692,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY BECAUSE IT'S GETTING GIVING IT A LITTLE SHOCK MAYBE,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE ENERGY KIND OF GETTING GIVING IT A LITTLE SHOCK MAYBE
1693,ENERGY MUST FLOW THROUGH,ENERGY MUST FLOW THERGH
1694,IT KIND OF MEANS LIKE IT REMINDS ME OF BATTERIES AND UHM HOW MAGNETS WORKS,IT KING OF MEANS CICE IT REMINES ME OF BATTERIES AND UM HOW MAGNET STORTS
1695,I CAN'T REMEMBER UHM IT WAS LAST FRIDAY,I CAN'T REMEMBER UIT WILL STASS FRIY DAY
1696,YOU MUST HAVE IT FLOWING IN A YOU MUST HAVE A CLOSED CIRCUIT,YOU MUST HAVE AT FLOWING AIN IT YOU MUST HAVE A CLOWSE CIRCUIT
1697,THAT IT IS IN A CIRCLE,STAT IT IS IN A CIRCLE
1698,THE SWITCH USUALLY WILL STOP AND MAKE THE ENERGY GO AND UHM THERE'S UHM WASHERS UHM THERE'S UHM WASHERS AND IT LOOKS LIKE AND UHM A WIRES AND D CELL BATTERY,THE SWITCH USUALLY WLL STOP AND MAKE THEENERGY GOW SAND UP THERE IS UM WASHRS THERE IS UMT WASHERS AND IT LITKS AA AND UM AT A WIRS AND D CELL BATTERY
1699,YOU WRAP IT UP ON,O O WRAPIT UP IN
1700,UHM YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BATTERY ELECTROMAGNET UHM YOU NEED UH YOU DO NEED ELECTRICITY IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK UHM,YOU MUST MEATRY HAVE A BATTERY ELECTROMAGNETS  YOU NEED A YOU DOU NEED LECTRICITY IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK UM
1701,THINK ABOUT WRAPPING THE WIRES AND UH MAKING SURE THE ENERGY'S ABLE TO FLOW,THINK BOUT WAPPING THE WIR STANDS MAING THA ENERGY SEA ABELE TO FLO
1702,IF UHM IF IT WAS UHM UHM IT WAS CLOSED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO IT WOULD UH IF IT'S CLOSED UHM ENERGY COULD GO THROUGH IF IT'S NOT CLOSED LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH,IF UM IF IT WAS UMU IT WAS CCLOSE ITWOULD BE AS TO ITLIXIF IT'S CCOWS UM ENERGYTOTA FLOW THROUGH IF  IT'S NOT CLOWSED LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW THENERG TOY AMPE IT THROUGH
1703,STEEL LIKE STEEL STEEL I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT UHM STEEL STEEL SORRY I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT BUT IT STARTS WITH STEEL I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PRONOUNCING IT RIGHT,STILL LAY STELL STILL I CAN'T PRONOUTS IT I'M STILL STELL SO I CAN'T NOT BUT STARTS WITH SDEL I CAN'T I I DON'T KNOW IF IT' PRONOUNTCSING IT RIGHT
1704,IT WOULD PROBABLY BECOME A MAGNET FOR A FEW SECONDS OR MINUTES IF SO IF THE WIRE WAS ON IT IT WOULD STAY A MAGNET FOR A LONG TIME WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THE UHM WIRE IT WILL PROBABLY STAY A MAGNET FOR JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS OR A MINUTE,IWHELL POLLU BECOME A MAGNET FOR A FEW SECOND SOURIMENTTS ITS SO IF THE WIRE WERE IS ON IT TIT WULD STY AMATER FOR TIME AND WHEN YOU TAKE UP THE WIR IT WILL PULLY STAY A MAGNETH FROJUCE A FEU MORE SECOND OMINET
1705,THE WIRES SUPPOSED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIVET SO ENERGY CAN GET TO THE RIVET AND MAKE IT INTO ELECTRIC ELECTROMAGNET,THE WIRES MUST BE CONNECTED TO THE RIVETS SO ENERGY TO TO GET TO THE RIVT IT MAKES INTO ELECTRIC ELECTR BUT THE  ELECTRIMAH EILL
1706,IT'S A PARALLEL,IT'S A PARAL LELL
1707,THE OTHER GOES OUT,EAT THERET GOSOUT
1708,UHM THE ENERGY KEEPS ON GOING,U THE ENERGY KEEPS ON GOING
1709,SERIES CIRCUITS ARE LIKE STRINGS OF LIGHTS,SERIES CARCOUATPS ARE BYE PSTERING SO LIGHT
1710,THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL STILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY THAT KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH,THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL STILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY THAT CEPS ON GOING THROUGH
1711,BECAUSE UHM BECAUSE ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH IT'S OPEN,BECAUSE UMBECAUSE ENERGY CANNOT GO THROUGH IT'S OPEN
1712,THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP,THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT
1713,UHM IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUIT A PARALLEL,UM A SPARAWAL CIRCUIT AF ARLL OB TWI
1714,BECAUSE ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH CORRECTLY,CAS ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW WVHER IT CORECT
1715,IT STOP,IT'S A STONK
1716,UHM THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE FLINT BURNS OUT,UM THE LIGHT BULB CAN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE FLART WAT BURNS O
1717,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,ICE PARALLELS
1718,THE ENERGY DID NOT GET THROUGH,TH ENERGY DES NOT GET PLERG
1719,NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO THE OTHER BULB,SORET NOTHING WILL HHAPPEN TO THE OTHER BALB
1720,THEY SOMETIMES ARE VERY BRIGHT,THEY SOMETIMES OR VAERYB
1721,JUST STAY OUT,WIT JUST STAY OUT
1722,NOT ALL OF THEM WILL BURN OUT BUT JUST THAT ONE WILL BURN OUT,NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BURN OUT BUT JUST THAT WIN WILL BURN OUT
1723,THE FILAMENT UHM BREAKS AND THE ENERGY ON THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER LIGHT BULB KEEPS ON GLOWING BUT THE ENERGY THAT'S TRYING TO GET TO THE UHM LIGHT BULB THAT HAS THE FILAMENT BROKEN IT JUST PAUSES AND STOPS LIKE A TRAFFIC JAM,THE FILIMENT UM BREATVES AND THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER LIGHT BULB HEATS ONE GOING BUT THE ENERGY THAT' TRYING TO D TO THE  UM LIGHT BULB THAT HAS THE FILLIAMENT BROKEN THE IT JUST POSES AND STOPS LIKE A TRAFFI JAM
1724,UHM THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN BUT UHM WHEN WHEN THE FILAMENT BROKE ON THE OTHER PICTURE AND THE LIGHT BULBS KEPT ON GLOWING WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS IN THIS PICTURE THE LIGHT BULB DOESN'T GLOW,UH THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN B UM WHEN WHEN THE FILLAMENT BROKS ON THE OTHER PICTHUR THE END THE LIGHT BULBS TEPT ON GOING WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS IN THESPICTURE THE LIGHT BULB DOESN'T GO
1725,A SERIES CIRCUIT,A STHERI CIRCUIT
1726,ENERGY NEED TO THROUGH IT OR MAYBE THE IS EITHER OLDER OR THERE'S TOO MUCH ENERGY,ENERGY NED S GET THROUGH AIT MAY BE THE FLIMET IS EATHER OLD OR THERE IS TOO MUCH ENERGY
1727,BECAUSE OF THE FLINT IF THE FLINT BURNS OUT THAT MEANS ENERGY CAN NOT PASS,BECAUSE OF THE FLINT IF THE FLINT BURNS OUT THAT MEANS ENERGY CAN NOT PASK
1728,I SEE THAT AND THAT UHM ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH IT IS OPEN,I SEE THAT AN THAT UM ENERGY CAS NOT GO THROUGH IT IS OPEN
1729,I AM GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,I AM GOOD HAVABOUT YOU
1730,THE IT JUST SHOWS YOU THAT'S BROKEN IT DOESN'T THE BULB UHM BURNING OUT IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU THAT UHM THE FILAMENT BURNED OUT,WHITHTHE ITCHUR SHOWS YOU THE FILLAMENT THAT'S BROKAND IT DOES THE BULB I'M BURNING OUT IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU THAT THE FILLAMENT UM BURNG TOV
1731,WE DIDN'T DO SCIENCE BECAUSE IT'S A TUESDAY,WE DENDET IT M TWO SINE BECAUSE IT'S IT TO STAYS
1732,BECAUSE CAN'T GET THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND GO TO THE UHM OTHER LIGHT BULB,BECAUSE ENERGY CAN'T GI THROUGHTHE FLYMANT AND GO TO THE UM EOTHER LIGHT BOL
1733,UHM THE FILAMENT BROKE BUT THEY STILL BUT THE TWO OTHER LIGHT BULBS CAN STILL GET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY,THE FILAMENT BROKE BUT THEY SOIT BUT THE TWO OTHER LIGHT BULBS TENSO THAT THEY'RE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY
1734,UHM THE FLINT BURNS OUT,UM THE FLINT BURNTS OUT
1735,THAT THE IT'S ONE LIGHT BULB'S ABLE TO LIGHT UP BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN WIRES AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REALLY SHARE ENERGY THE OTHER CAN'T BECAUSE THE FLINT BURNED OUT,THAT THE IT'S IN ONE LIGHT BULB'S ABLE TO LIGHT UP BECAUSE IT HASE IT'S OWN WIR AND IT DOESEN'T HAVE TO WRELLY SHUR ENERGY THE OTHER THANP BECAUSE THEF FOOG BARG
1736,THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB LIT UP BECAUSE UHM IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT,THE LIGHT BULB LHTES OF THE LIGHT BULBS LIT UP BECAUSE UM IT IS A TALL CIRCUIT
1737,THEY ARE KIND OF A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS USUALLY KIND OF STRAIGHTER,THEY ARE T GETS TIND OUH I'M SUA PAREL CIRCUIT IS USUALLY KINDOF STRAIGHTER
1738,WHEN THE BULB NOTHING THE ENERGY CAN'T GET THROUGH,THE NHE BULB BRATES NOTHING AND THE ENERGY CANT IT THROUG
1739,BECAUSE THAT ONE BURNS OUT UHM THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS CAN'T GET THEIR ELECTRICITY,BECAUSE THAT ONE BURNS OUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS THANED THERE ELECTRICITY
1740,NO I CAN'T,NO I CAN'T
1741,WELL THE BIG DROP GOES FASTER THAN THE LITTLE DROP BECAUSE THE LITTLE DROP IS LIKE SMALLER BUT I THINK BECAUSE THE BIG DROP HAS MORE DROPS IN IT THAT IT THAT IT'S LIKE,REALLY FS

1883,WE PUT BOTH OF THE WATERS IN AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT YOU PUT A THERMOMETER AFTER IN AFTER WE PUT MIXED THE WATERS TOGETHER AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE WHICH WAS TWENTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS,WE PUT BOB OF THE WATERSING AND ITWE FIGURED OUT THAT WHE PLIT A YTHOG ROG ATER END AFFTER WEIT MAKXS THE WATERS TOGETHER AND IT TURNESD OUT TO E MEAN TEMPERATHUR WICH AS TWENTY TO MEDS
1884,SOME OF THEM HAVE CELSIUS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE FAHRENHEIT HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE USES CELSIUS BESIDES US,E WA AY WIGTT SOME OF TEM THAT HAVE CELLS EASTLY AND SONE ONFD THE HAVE FIRE RIGHT THEIR SOI THAT IS EVERY ONE MEASES SOUT ES SIDE NORTATHETAWS
1885,THEY'RE DOING THE EXPERIMENT THAT I DID YESTERDAY AND I THINK THEY'RE PUTTING IT IN ORDER AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE KIND OF DOING A SURVEY WHICH ONE WHAT THEY THINK,THERE DOING THAT EXPERIMENT THAT I GO ESSTAR A I THINK THERE'S PUTING IT OORAEXEPTV IND O DSURAY WHICH WASHS THE TINGING
1886,YES,YES
1887,IT WENT GREAT,IT ONE BRATHE A
1888,YES BOILING FOR CELSIUS IS A HUNDRED DEGREES AND FOR THE FREEZING TEMPERATURE FOR CELSIUS IS ZERO DEGREES,YES BOILING FOR CELSIUS IS A HUNDRED EATS AND WER THE FREASING TEMPERATAURE  OR SELSTIU ANDSEROU YPES
1889,I THINK HE'S MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE WITH HIS FINGER TO ESTIMATE BEFORE HE IS GONNA PUT A THERMOMETER IN THERE,I THINK HE'S MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE WITH THIS FINGER TO ASK TO ME BEFORE S THAN IT FLUGH A THEIR ANERY ER I
1890,YES,YES
1891,WELL HOW HOW IS HE,WELL HEAPS H THES ES
1892,I'M GOOD AND HOW ARE YOU,I'M GOA AND HOW ARE YOU
1893,THAT THE PAPER CLIP WOULD WEIGH I MEAN GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP WOULD WEIGH MORE THAN THE OTHER THINGS THEY'RE WEIGHING IN GROUP ONE'S WOULD WEIGH UM LESS AG AGAINST THE OTHER THING,THAT THE PAPER CCLIP WOID WY I MEAN GROUP TO UE PAPER CLIP WOULD WAY MR THEN THE OTHER THINGS THEIR WING AN GROUP ONES WOID WAY UM LESS U AGENST THE OTHER THINGS
1894,YES I THINK THAT WAS THE WAIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT,YES I THINK THAT WHAIS THEWEIT  DON'T NO WHAT THE
1895,THEY'RE ABOUT HOW TO WEIGH S UM SMALL THINGS LIKE YOU CANNOT WEIGH A UM YOU WELL GRAMS ARE USED FOR WEIGHING SMALL THINGS,THERE ABOUT HOW TO WAG UM SMALL THINGS LIKE YOU CANNOT WAGY  UM YOU WELL GRAMS ARE USED FOR WEINING SMALL THINGS
1896,WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING WEIGHT AND HOW HEAVY THINGS ARE,WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING WEIGHT AND HOW HEAVY THINGS ARE
1897,BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WEIGHING VERY VERY BIG THINGS WE'RE WEIGHING KIND OF SMALL THINGS LIKE A DICE AND OTHER SMALL THINGS LIKE THAT,BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WEING VERY VERY BIG THINGS WERE WING KIND OF SMALL THINGS LIKE A DICE AND OTHER SMALL THINGS LIKE THAT
1898,AND THAT'S KIND OF IT,AND THAT'S KIND OF IT
1899,GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP IS BIGGER THAN GROUP ONE'S SO MAYBE GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP WEIGHS MORE THAN GROUP ONE'S,GROUP TOUSE PAPER CLIP IS BIGER THAN GROUPS ONE SO MAYBE GROUP TOUSE PAPER CLIP WEAIGHS MORE THAN GROUP ONES
1900,GOOD,GOOD
1901,MMM YES,YES
1902,WE USED A,WE OUSED JUS
1903,WELL UM WE MEASURED A UM APPLE IN OUR CLASS IT UM IT DIDN'T LOOK IT WEIGHED TOO MUCH IT WASN'T THAT BIG BUT IT WAS A LOT OF UM GRAMS WE'VE BEEN MEASURING IN GRAMS,WELL UM WE MEASURED A UM APPL IN OUR CLASS A UM DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WEIGHED MUCH IT WASN'T THAT BIG BUT IT WAS A LOT OF UM GRAMS WE'VE BEEN MEASURING IN GRAMS
1904,METERS CENTIMETERS METERS AND MILLIMETERS,METER CENTIMETERS AND MILLIMETERS
1905,BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES PAPER CLIPS CAN BE ANY SIZE IT COULD BE BIG PAPER CLIPS SMALL PAPER CLIPS BUT GRAMS ARE ONLY ONE KIND THERE'S ONE GRAM,BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES PAPER CLIPS CAN BE ANY SIZE ITCAND BIG BIG PAPER CLIP SMALL PAPER CLIPS BUT GRAMS ARE ONLY ONE KIND HIT 'S ONE GRAM
1906,THAT EACH UM PAPER CLIP IS WEIGHING I MEAN YEAH EACH PAPER CLIP IS WEIGHING MORE SINCE THEY'RE IN A I DON'T KNOW,THAT EACH UM PAPER CLIPIS WEIGING I MEAN YUH EACH PAPER CLIP IS WEIGING MORE SCENSTER AND UH  OUT
1907,UM WE'VE USED I THINK SO FAR WE'VE ONLY USED CRAYONS CA,UM WE'VE USEI THINK SO FAR WE'VE ONLY YOU SQRAMS
1908,UM I GUESS SO BUT I'M MORE I'M BETTER AT WEIGHING WITH GRAMS,UM AY GES SO BUT I'M MORE I 'M BETTER OUT WEDNG WITH GRAMS
1909,I GUESS THERE'S ONE GROUP O OF THERE'S A TWO A GROUP THAT SAYS NUMBER TWO AND A GROUP THAT SAYS NUMBER ONE I GUESS THE UM NUMBER TWO GROUP HAS THE SOME PAPER CLIPS IN THEM THEY'RE WEIGHING PAPER CLIPS AND GROUP ONE IS WEIGHING DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE GROUP TWO IS HOW MUCH IS UM EACH UM PAPER CLIP UM WEIGHS,I GES THERE 'S ONE ROUP  OF THERE'S A TWUO A GROUP THATS AS NUMBER TO AND A GROUP THATS IS NUMBERD ONE I GES THE UM NUMBERD TWO GROUP HAS THE SOM PAPER CLIPS IN THEM THERE WHEN PAPER CLIPS IN GROUP ONE IS WEIGHING DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE GROUP TO IS HOW MUCH IS UM EACH M PAPER CLIP M WEAST
1910,THAT THEY FOUND OUT THE PLASTIC DISK IS UM FOUR GRAMS AND SINCE THEY WEIGHED WITH SOMETHING UM LESS IS HEAVY IT LOOKED LIKE THE OTHER THING WAS LESS HEAVY,THAT THEY FOUND OUT THE PLASTIC DIS IS UM FOR GRAMS AND SENS THEY WEIGHE WITH SOMETHING UM LESES HEAVY IT LOOK LIKE THE OTHER THING WATH LATHS HAVING
1911,I SEE TWO PIECES OF A BALANCE AND TWO CUPS,I SEEO TWO PIECES OF ABOUND AND TWO CUPS
1912,YOU PUT ONE THING IN WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTING ONE THING IN IN ONE CUP ONE THING IN THE OTHER AND SEEING IF WE COULD MAKE EACH ONE EXACTLY THE SAME WEIGHT,YOU PUT ONE THING ON WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTING ONE THING ON THE IN ONE CUP ONE THING IN THE OTHER AND SING IF WE CULD MAKE EACH ONE EXACTLY THE SAME WEIGHT

2076,OKAY CAN WE SKIP THIS,OKAY THIEN WE SKIP THIS
2077,WELL BURN TO FIRE,WILL BURN TO FIR
2078,AND BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW ALSO WE KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND SOME OTHER THING,PARTONY BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING GET FLOW OFF SO WE NOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND NOT SOME OTHER THING
2079,IS BURNING AND FLAMING IN HEAT,IS BURNING AND FLAMING INE

2099,I'M SORT OF BUSY REALLY BUSY YEAH,I'M SORT OF BISYREEALLY BISYYEA
2100,SUPER CONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET,UM SUPER CONDUCTRS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
2101,I NOTICED THAT THE MAGNET THE TWO MAGNETS HAVE A NORTH AND SOUTH SIDE WHICH WILL RED AND WHITE AND THAT THEY ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE WHICH IS MAGNETIC FOR IRON AND METALLIC ITEM IS,I NOTETS THAT THE MAGNETS THAT TWO MAGNETS HAVE AN NORTH AND SOUTH SIDE WHICH IS RED AND WIGHT AND THAT THEY ARE STICKKING TO THE FOILIGE WHICH IS MAGNETTIC FROUE OF IRN AD ATAOLIC TITIS
2102,WELL YOU SEE THE WOOD DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL AND ANY OTHER MAGNET SO SUPER CONDUCTORS SO WILL NOT STICK,WELL YOU SEE THE WOOD DOES NOT HAVE ANY UM IERON OR STEEL IN IT OR OTHER MAGNETS OR SOUH SUPER CONDEUCTERS SO IT WILL NOT STICK
2103,THEY ONLY STICK TO METALLIC ITEMS SUCH AS METALS STEEL AND IRON BUT NOT ALUMINIUM OR OTHER STUFF THEY ONLY STICK TO,THEY ONLY STICK TO MEPALICK ITEMS SUCH AS METAL STEEL AND D IRON BUT NOT ALUMANUM OR OTHER STUFF THEY ONLY STICK TO
2104,WOOD TIN WELL PAPER CABINET MAYBE AND PLASTIC,WOOD TEN WOILL PAPER CABIENET MAYBEY AND PLASTICK
2105,WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER MAGNET OR ANY IRON OR STEEL AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A SUPER CONDUCTOR BUT THE NAIL DOES HAVE IRON AND STEEL I SAID THAT A LOT,WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER MAGNETS OR OR ANY IRON OR STEEL AND IT DOESN'T HAVE H SSUBER CONDUCTOR BUT THE UM NAIL DOES HAVE IRONSTEEL I SAY THAT A LOT
2106,STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPER CONDUCTORS,STEEL AN IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPER CONNECTERS
2107,BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR IS IRON AND STEEL AND THEY LIKE TO STICK TO METAL AND STEEL,BECAUSE THE REFERTORATER IS U IRON AND FROM STEL AND THEY LIKE TO STIC TE METALA STEEL
2108,THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON MAKING IT STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT THE WOOD IS NOT SO YEAH,THE DAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRN MAKING ET STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT THE WOOD IS NOT SO YEAH
2109,I'M SORRY AND BUSY YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT,UM SORRY AND BISY AND MII DON'T EALLY HVE TIBED FOR THIT
2110,THEY HAVE IRON,THEY HAVE IRON
2111,BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON,CAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRN
2112,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'TNO
2113,I THINK THE OBJECTS THAT THAT'S THAT HAVE BEEN STICKING HAVE THE METALLIC ITEMS THAT MAKES IT STICK TO THE MAGNET,I THINK THE OBJECTS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN STICKING HAVE THE MATTAOLLICK ITEMS THAT MAKES IT'STICK TO THE MAGNET

2120,THEY ARE FLYING IN A CIRCUIT AND THERE ARE ENERGY,THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
2121,NOTICED THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING INTO AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT,NOTICED THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
2122,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2123,WIDER OR BEING VERY COMPLICATE,RIGHTER OR BEAPHER YOU COMPLEKATE T
2124,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DISCONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON I FORGOT YOUR QUESTIONS ANYWAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS THIS CONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT IS N'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING OR SOME RESAN BUT I FORGOT YOUR QUESTIO N ANY WAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT
2125,OKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN A,EOLOKAY I DON'T KNOWTHE PATHS ARE GOING IN A
2126,BECAUSE THEY DO,I BECAUSE THEY DO
2127,OH NO AS WE,IDON'T KNOWAS
2128,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
2129,KNEW,NEOL

2134,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2135,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN VERY RADICAL WAY,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RATTICAL WAY
2136,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME,THEY'RE LIGTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IT IS VERY COMPLECATED TO ME
2137,IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE THE THUNDER YEAH YEAH EXACTLY THUNDER HA LIKE THAT LIKE YEAH,IT'S BECAUSE IT IS HARDER AND COMPLECATED IN STUFF LIKE KINDIDOR YEAH YOU AXACTLY KIND OR HOW YE LIKE WEGREE LIKEYEAH
2138,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF,I LTHINK THAT TEA BECAUSE IT IS ADY STUFF
2139,I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT,I NOTICED THAT IS IT THAT IT IS A SURCITS BYEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
2140,THEY ARE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND BUT IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED FOR ME AND <unk>,AIRCOMPARED UM BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND SBITS AND A MORE CONMPLCATED FORMANRALLI IL TSTI
2141,NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD,NOTICED THAT IT IS GOING THROUUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RAGA CAL
2142,IT IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND THE STUFF,SH IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH OF ONE D CELL AND WE DID THISIN CQLASAND  STUF
2143,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,CAUNS YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
2144,WHAT,WHAT
2145,DON'T,NO
2146,THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2147,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE AMOUNT IT'S GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS,THIS FORMATIONI'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL IN GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE  THAN THE GRAVE THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUS BU THE MOUNT IT'S GOOD AND ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CANT ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE  IT'S ALWAYS ON OUT SIDE AND PEOPLE UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANT
2148,GOOD,HM GOOD
2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,WELL SOIL DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVL IS MUCH MORE YOUON' KNOWL LIKE HOW MUCH IT HAS HOLDS FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOILE DOESE WITH THE WATER GOE DOWN AINT GETS LET IT GOE DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME CKIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,I ELL YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TO
2151,WE BEEN,THEY WHERY DOING
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,WE I ABSERVE THAT UM THE WIR GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POR WATER ON GRAVEL
2153,I SEE WATER IN SOIL,I SEE YOU WATER AND SOIL
2154,YEAH,YEAH
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DOIY WATER GETS ABSORBED CQUICKTER OR CLEANS
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,YEAH CAUS UM CAUSE THE SOL THE SOIL KEEPS OUTF OTHER WATER TO IT SELF SO IT CAN LIK GROW IT CANT LOIT GROW SOMEKIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRING DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP THE THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOWES DOWN FLP SLOLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOALS
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,WELL THE SOII UM ABSORBD MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILAL LITERS AND AND BET IT WON'T LET IF ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FOR TY WHICH IS TE POSEIVEL AT FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IS CLOSES THE FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND M AND IT COULD BE HEALTTY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HELTY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT
2158,GOT WET,
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,PUTTING MORE INMFERMATION IS AND PART TANS BECAUSE YOU CULD NOW AND PEOPLE WILLE USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING  SCO YOUW TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBESIT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'IT AIT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WE GRAP GRAPFL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO JHOP WATERS
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I ABSERB THAT UM YEU UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANY WERE BECAUSE IT START AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DYE THE GRAVEVLE KILLES THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATERS GOES DOWN TO THE CUP
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,THE THING THATAT ORGANNIZSE IS WHEN YOU UST PUT POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR IT'S PLANT TO SAYVE IT AND THE GRAVEL IT'S JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN THER LIKE TAKES THE WATER AIR IT LET'S THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE  THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MYTEA
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCK S ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER ANS STILL GO AWAYING BECAUSE THE WATER SFLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLD A OF IM THE SOIL YOU CAT COL TER ECAUSE THERE'S NOT HOS AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVEN OF ROUM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH CELLS SOME OF ITCH S GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERS ONLY SOME HOS AROUND THERE
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,IT DOESN'T GO TBROUGH OND IT THE WATER'S TIRTY AND IT KEEPS HOLE A LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND E LITTLE BIT AF WATER ON THE BOTTOM
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,WE WERE DOING WIT SOIL AND WROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER AND SOIL
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE GRAVEL IS HIER AND HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER
2168,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,WHEN I USED TABLES I I USED POTTING SOIL THEN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE PONEY SOIUL IS DIRT SO IT STUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T I'LLE JUST LIGHT IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WULD DIE
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,ECAUSE UM SOMETIMES THE THE POTING SOIL IT'S GOOD A UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROWS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HELTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS AL READY INTO THE ROCKS  THE AND THE THE POTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNTS OF JRIM IS NT BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT AND THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT
2171,BYE,BYE
2172,YEP YEP,YEUP YEUP
2173,WELL THE GRA THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOIL'S WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT U ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS IT ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUGH,WELL THE GRAVE THE I MEAN THE SOIL THE SOIL WATER DOESE IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THE SOILS KEEP IN IT ALL THE WATER BUT SEM WATER GETS THROUGH GRIPS ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S OLES THAT IF F IT THROUGH
2174,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GE AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'D BE GREAT,WELL YOU CAN GO IN YOU CAPETER AND WELL YOU CAN'T GOWNIT COMPOUTE YOU COULD TAKE THE RECORTER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TOYOUR HOUSE AND GOING TO ROUM AND THEN UM AND THEN GOL GET WATER AND YOU SBIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN YOU SUBMEATERIAL AND THEN YOU COUL SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN' GO AND IF IT GO MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THATWL BE GRAT
2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER JRAINS WITH UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEVE LOTS OF SPAKE TO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF  WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT
2176,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESN'T IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T UM WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON 'EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,WHEN YOU PORT ONTO THE ERTH MATERIAL AT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIAL IT DOES IT  STICK STAS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL THE ROCKS CAN'T UM WEYOU POR WATER ON UM THE IT GOES MAS MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOALD
2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THEIS MORE SOILE AND MORE WATER AND THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OND THE GRAVELE THAT THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL
2178,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN,I THINK WHATS WHAT'S GOING ON THAT IT WEATS GETTING DIRTY AND RETRANCY IF IT GOT LIKET IF IT ABSORB FROM DIRTY THEN CLEN
2179,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER,YEH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL I'S MUCH MORE HEAVIERREALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TUCK THE WATER
2180,UHM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK,UM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK
2181,UHM WELL UHM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE,UM WELL UM WHEN LIGHT IS SINNING LIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COM OUT COLER IT COMES OUT WIGHT
2182,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE,WHENNIALIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLER OF BLUE FROM THE RAIN BOULE LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAIN ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OH THY OTHER COULER'S SHINES THERE'SO IT JUST BLOUESO IT'S JUST BLOUE
2183,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BALL,IT DOESN'T SNOW RED OVER THE BLUE BUL
2184,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WIGHT AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE
2185,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT,WELL I NOTICED THAT THERE IS TM WIGHT LIGHT
2186,GOOD,GOOD
2187,SO WHEN THE WHITE UHM LIGHT SHINING ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,SO WHEN THE WIGHT UM LIGHT SHINS ONTO THE YELLOR BULB THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2188,WELL UHM THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL BECAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK IT JUST LOOKS BLACK,WELL UM THE LIGHT YA IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES T THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WIGHT PAPER SO T LOOKS RED ICSEPT THE BLUE BOLPK AS THE RED AND BLUE BULB JUST THE BLUE BULB JUST LOOKS BLUE WERE BLACK JUST OOKS LK
2189,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLER OF WHAT THE BALB CULER IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BULL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BULL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE
2190,BECAUSE THE GREEN LIGHT IS GREEN,AUS THE GREAMINE IS AGR
2191,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY UHM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL THEY ARE YELLOW,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT RE HITTING THE BALL ARE WEIGHT AND WHEN THEY ARE ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL IT THEIRE GET
2192,RED,READ
2193,UHM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,UM WHEN THE WHIGHT LIGHT SINDS ONTO THE YELLOW BULB YELLO LIGHT COMES OUT
2194,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL,ALL THE COLERS TURN THE OTHER COLEC CEP FOM THE YELLOW BAL
2195,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT AROUND,LY THE READ COLER CAN MAKE IT WTHROUT
2196,WELL SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB,WELL SHOWN FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LAIGHT BULB
2197,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UHM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UHM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT U RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THE ROUVE UHM IT JUST LIKES RED ACSEPT FOR THE BLUE BULB THE BLUE BULB DOES NOT LOKE TH
2198,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT
2199,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THAT COLOR TOO,YOU HAVH THE COLER OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT IF THE FILTEAR PAPER WOULD THE OTHER OBJECT WUL TURN THE COLLER TOH
2200,SO WHEN WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL UHM THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAME WITH THE BLUE SO ONLY YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BALL AND ONLY BLUE COMES THROUGH FOR THE BLUE BALL BLUE BALL,SO WETER WLIGHT LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BOLB FHORE THE BLUEB BULL UM THE OTHER COLL F THE RING BOLB CAN'T COME THROUGH EXEPT FOR THE COLER OF YELLOW WIT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAY THT THE FLB OLW HEN THE YELLOW COMES THROGH FOR THE EL BLL AND WILL W L COME TTE TO THE BULB BIBFBLUE BOFF
2201,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UHM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT AS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW,WHIGHT LIGHT IS REALLLY THE COLLERS OF THE RAIN BOUL BUT UH MIX TOGETHER IT SHOWS WIGHT SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES TROGH THE PRISNEM IT RUFF COMES OUT WITH THE COLLERS OF THE RAIN BOLB
2202,COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH,THE COLEAR WELLT SINED THROUGH
2203,IT'S TURNING BLACK,IT'S TURNING BACK
2204,SO UHM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT,O UM THE YELLOW BULL IS BLOCK ING ALL THE OTHER COLLERS OF THE RAIN BUOGCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BOBS BOB AND AL THE OTHER COULLERS OF THE RAIN BULL EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGH

2212,THAT IT DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF WASHERS PICKED UP,THAT IT DUBLES THE NUMBER OF WASHERS PICKED UP
2213,ELECTROMAGNETS ARE MAGNETISM OR MAGNETS WITH ELECTRICITY IN THEM,TROMAD ELECTROMAGNETS ARE MAGNETISM OR MAGNETS WITH  ELECTRICITY AND
2214,I DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE WINDS YOU ADD AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE STEEL WASHERS THE ELECTROMAGNET ATTRACTS,I DSCOVERD THAT THE MORE WINES YOU ADD AROUND THE STEL RIVET THE MOORE STEEL WOSPERS THE ELECTROMAGNET ATTRACTS
2215,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2216,MANY WASHERS THERE HOW MANY WASHERS THERE ARE,HOW MANY WASHERS THERE ARE HOW MANY WASHERS THEYRE ARE
2217,I DON'T KNOW THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER WHEN YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WINDS AND IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS,I DON'T KNOW THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER WHEN YOU INCREASE A NUMBER OF WINES AND THE IT PICKS UP MORE STILL WASHERS
2218,THE STRENGTH OF THE THE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET IT'S STRONGER AND THEN IT THE MORE WINDS AROUND IT MAKES IT STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS,THE STRENGTH OF THE T OF THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER AND THEN IT THE MORE MINES AROUND IT MAKES A STRONGER AND THEN IT PICKS UP MORE STEL WASHERS
2219,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CANERE BEATT
2220,I NOTICED THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET TURNS ON AND ATTRACTS THE WASHERS,I LNOTICE THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET TURNS ON AND ATTRACTS THE WASHERS

2228,IT ATTRACTS MORE STEEL WASHERS,IT ATTRACTS MORE STHELD WASHER
2229,I NOTICED THAT THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES WHEN THERE'S TWO D CELLS,I NOTICE THAT THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREACES WHEN THERE IS TWO D CELLS
2230,IT DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF THE WASHERS PICKED UP,IT DUOBLES THE AMOUNT OF WASHERS PICKED UP
2231,THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES WITH THE AS THE NUMBER OF WINDS INCREASES,THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES WITH THE AS THE NUMBER OF WINES INCREACSES
2232,THIRTEEN,THIRTTEN

2700,YES,YES
2701,A WIRE,A WIRE
2702,IT HAS TO IT HAS TO GO IN A CIRCLE FOR IT TO ACTUALLY GO OFF YES UH CONNECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IF LIKE IF THAT ONE DIDN'T CONNECT TO THAT ONE IT WOULD NOT GIVE OFF ENERGY BECAUSE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'LL GO UP INTO THIS ONE AND LIGHT IT UP AND THEN IT'LL GO OVER TO THIS ONE LIGHT UP AND IF THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THIS ONE JUST WOULDN'T LIGHT IT WOULD BE ALL BY NO,IT HAS TO GO ET INROVR IT HAS TO GO IT A CIRCLE FOR IT A ACTULY GO OFF YES AL CONNECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IF LIKE IF THAT WONE DIDN'T CONNECT TO THAT WHEN IT WOULD NOT GIVE OFF ENERGY BCAUSE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT 'LL GO UP INTO THIS WONEE LIGHT IT UP AND THEN IT'LL GO OVER TO THIS ONE LIGHT B BUOF AND IF THAT WASN'T THEIRE THEN THIS ONE JUST PINE LIGHT ITWOULD BE ALL GNY ELECTRICI RIGHT NO
2703,WELL WHAT'S GOING IS THIS IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP AND THAT IS GIVING OFF THE D CELL IS THE SAME ONE IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE SO IT MAKES IT LIGHT,WELL WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS IS GIVING OFF ENERGY THEIS ONE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP AND THAT IS GIVING UP THE D CELL IS THE SAME ONE SIING OF ENERGY TO THAT ON SO IT MAKES THOMP LIGHT
2704,IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY WERE ALL THE SAME LIGHT L YES YES,IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY WERE ALL THE SAME LIGHT H  YES YES
2705,I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE THAT,I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE THAT
2706,YEAH,YEAH
2707,UH NOT REALLY,UH NOT REALLY
2708,WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS THAT WHAT WE TRIED DID NOT WORK CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD WORK THAT THAT WOULD WORK BUT IT DIDN'T CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THOSE HAD TO CONNECT BUT NOW THAT I'M LOOKING BACK ON WHAT I DID I THINK IT DOES NEED TO CONNECT,WHATSURPRIZSED ME THE MOST WAS THAT WHAT WE TRYE DIDN'T NOT WORK CAUSE I THOT THAT THIS WOULD WORK THAT THAT WOULD WORK BUAT IT DIDN'T CUSE I DIDN'T THINK THOESE HAD TO CONNECT BUT NOW THAT I'M LOKING BACK ON WHAT I DID I THINK IT DOESN'TNED TO CONECTIE
2709,TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE MISS DUNN TOLD US THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE THIS,TWOBATTERIES BECAUSE  TUME TOLD SO WE EED TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE THIS
2710,NO YES WE HAVE MMM HMM,NO GES WE HAVE M
2711,NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED THAT THAT MEANS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY SO YES,NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED THAT THAT MEANS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR ONES FLOW THAT WAY SYES
2712,YES,YES
2713,AND THOSE ARE TH N N AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A WIRE THAT WENT THROUGH ONE OF THE METAL THINGS AND THEN IT WOULD GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE THE TWO WIRES AND WE WERE TRYING TO OUT THEM ONTO THE BATTERY SO IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS SO IT WOULD BE BRIGHTER,AND THESE ED THA AND THEN THER OLD BE A WIRE THAT WHENT THRUGH ONE OF THE METAL THINGS AND THEN IT WOULD GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OVER HEARH AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE THE TWO WIRES AND WE WERE TRYING TO PUT THEM ON TO THE BATTERY SO ILOOK LIKE THIS SO IWI'D BE BRIGHTER
2714,WE QU DIDN'T QUITE FIGURE IT OUT YET WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO TWO LIGHT BULBS,WE DIDN'T QUIGHT FIGURE IT OUT YETWE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO TWO LIGHT BULBS
2715,OKAY,OKAY
2716,BECAUSE THE BATTERY WOULD STILL GIVE OFF ENERGY AND IT WON'T AFFECT THAT ONE,BECAUSE THE BATTERY WALS STILL GIVE OFF ENERGY AND IT WON'T AFFECT THAT ONE
2717,YES,YES
2718,NOTHING,NOTHING
2719,WE WERE TRYING TO CREATE A CIRCUIT MMM HMM A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE PRETTY MUCH IT'S WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH ONE SIDE THE BATTERY GOES TO SOMETHING MAKES IT LIGHT UP OR RUN AND THEN GOES AGAIN THROUGH AND THEN IT'LL JUST MAKE A CIRCLE CIRCUIT YES NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS CAUSE IT CAN GO EITHER WAY OR IT CAN GO BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME,WE WERE TRYING TO CREAT A CIRCUIT E A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE PRETY MUCH ITS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH ONE SID OF TH BATTERY GOS TO SOMETHING MAKES I LIGHT UP OR RUNE AND THEN GOES AGAIN THROUGH AND THEN IT'LLJUST MACE A CIRCLE CIRCUIT YES NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS CAUSE IT CAN GO EATHER WAY OR IT CAN GO BOTH DERECTIONS AT THESAME TIME
2720,WELL BECAUSE IT WAS SHARING OFF THE SAME UM WIRES AND THE WIRE COULDN'T N THE BATTERY COULDN'T PULL OFF ENOUGH ENERGY TO G THE WIRE TO GIVE TO THE BATTERIES BUT WHEN IT'S SEPARATE IT GIVES OFF MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE AND NOT OFF THE ONE,WELL BECAUSE IT WAS SHARRING OFF THE SAME UM WIRES AND THE WIRE COULDN'T THE BATTERY COULDNT PULL OFF N NUFF ENERGY TO THE WIRE TO GIVE TO THE BATTERIES WLL WHEN IT'S SEPARAT IT GIVES OFF MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND SEPARET AND NOT OFF THE ONE
2721,HAS TO GO BACK TO THE ENERGY SOURCE,HAS TO GOE BACK TO THE ENERGY SOURCE
2722,ONE,ONE
2723,OKAY,OKEMIK
2724,OKAY,MM I TO
2725,YES,S
2726,YEAH,YEAH
2727,THEY DON'T WORK,THEY DON'T FFORK
2728,WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES EACH BATTERY WILL BE A SOURCE FOR THE LIGHT BULB FOR EACH LIGHT BULB AND IT'LL BE BRIGHTER,WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES EACH BATTERY WILL BE A SOURCE FOR THE LIGHT BULB FOR EACH LIGHT BULB AND IT WILL BE BRIGHTER
2729,YES I CAN UM I CAN TELL YOU FOR ONE THING THESE ONES NEITHER OF THESE ARE PARALLEL BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM GO LIKE THAT AND THAT N ALL THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING SEE LIKE THAT,YES I CAN UM I CAN TELL YOU FOR ONE THING THESE ONES NEETHEROF THESE AR PARALLEL BECAUSE NEETHER OF THEM GO LIKE THAT AND THAT ALL HE WIRES ARE TOUCHING SEE LIKE THAT
2730,YES WE DID,YES WE DID
2731,YES WE DID,YES WE DID
2732,THOSE ARE THE WIRES AND THOSE ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,THOSE ARE THE WIRES AND THOSE ARE THE LIGHT BULBS
2733,TWO,TO
2734,YES,YES
2735,WELL WHAT WE DID WAS WE JUST TOOK A BATTERY THERE AND THEN WE JUST DID THAT AND WE THOUGHT THAT THOSE WOULD MIX AND THEY DIDN'T SOME,WELL WE DID WE SE WE JUST TOLK ABATTERY THERE AND THEN WE JUST DID THAT AND WE THOGHT THAT THOSE WOULD MIX AND THEY DIDN'TSO
2736,DIAMOND,DYE NON
2737,YES THEY ARE OPPOSITES THIS ONE IS NOT FACING THAT WAY SO THERE IS NOTHING RIGHT THERE AND THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT THERE WHICH MEANS THAT THE BACKS AND THE BACK OR THE PAH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BOTH THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND BOTH THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND ARE GOING THAT WAY NEGATIVE POSITIVE,YES THEY ARE OPPASITE THIS ONE IS NOT FASING THAT WAY SO THERE I'S NOTHING RIGHT THAT AND THERE'S NOTHING WRIGHT THAT WHICH MEANS THAT THE BACKS AND THE BACK OR THEM PTHE NEGATIVE SIDE BOTH THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND BOTH THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE AWAY FROM EACHOTHER AND NOMT GOING THAT WAY NEGATIVE POSITIVE
2738,MMM HMM YES,YM H CEL YES
2739,THE RECEIVERS YES,THE RECSEMITERS YES
2740,OKAY NO NOT AT ALL,LOOKA NO DOT TO KNO
2741,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATTERY'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO GIVE OFF TO THAT ONE IF THAT ONE'S BROKEN THERE'S NO ENERGY TO GIVE OFF TO THE OTHER RECEIVER,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATTERIYS PALE TO GIVE OUT ENERGY THIS ONE TO GIVE OFF TO THAT WEN IF THATWAN'S BROKEN THERE'S NO ENERGY O GIVE OFF TO THE OF THE RECEEIVER
2742,NO,NO
2743,WELL SAME THING IF IF SAY THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THAT ONE WOULD GET OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE BUT IF THIS ONE WEREN'T THERE THEN IT WOULD NOT GET ANYTHING EVE IF BUT IF THERE WAS A SWITCH HERE IF THIS WERE THERE AND I DID THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IT WOULD GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN IT WOULDN'T QUITE MATCH UP WITH THAT IF THAT WASN'T THERE AND THEN IT'S GONE,WELL THE SAME THING IF IF SAY THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THAT WONE WOULD GET OFF ENERGYY THAT ONE BUT IF THIS ONE WERE THERE THEN IT WOULD NOT GET ANYTHING IFN IF BUT IF THERE WAS A SWITCH HER IF THIS WERE THERE AND I DID THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IT WOULD GO THROUGH HER AND THEN IT WOULDN'T QUIGHT MUCH UP WITH THAT IF THAT WASN'T THEIRE AND THEN IT'S GON
2744,YEP YEP,YEAH YEO
2745,WELL THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO TODAY WAS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE TWO OF THE SERIES UM CIRCUIT AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER THOUGH WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A CIRCUIT WHICH WOULD BE,WELL THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO TODAY WAS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE TO OF THE SERIESS UM CIRCUIT AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER THEO WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A CIRCUIT WHICH WOULD BE
2746,YES S BECAUSE WITHOUT THE WIRES WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE UH ENERGY GO THROUGH TO THE BAT TO THE MOTOR OR THE LIGHT BULB,YES SBECAUSE WITH OUT THE WIRES WE WOULN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE UH ENERGY GO THROGH TO THE BAG UTO THE MOTOR OR THE LIGHT BULB
2747,THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH THIS METAL BAR AND INTO THE OTHER UM METAL PIECE AND GOING THOUGH BACK TO THE WIRES AND INTO THE ENERGY SOURCE,THE ELECTRICITYIS GOING THROUGH THIS METAL BARE AND INTO THE OTHER UM METAL PIECE AND GOING THROUGH BACK THE WIRES AND INTO THE ENERGY SURCE
2748,YOU NEED TO HOOK THEM TOGETHER SO IT MAKES MORE ENERGY FOR THEM TO FLOW,YOU NEED TO HOK THEM TOGETHER SO IT MAKES MORE ENERGY FOR THEM TO FLOW
2749,WELL THE WIRES UM CAUSE IT'S METAL TO METAL AND W THE WELL WHEN METAL AND METAL CONNECT THE BATTERY WILL GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THE WIRES THAT SENDS THROUGH THE COPPER INTO THE UM INTO THE LIGHT BULBS OR THE MOTOR,WELL THE WIRES UM CAUSE IT'S METAL TO METAL AND THE WELL WHEN METAL AND METAL CONNEACT THE BATTERY WILL GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THE WIRES THAT SENDS THROUGH THE COPPER INTO THE UM INTO THE LIGHT BULBS OR THE MOTOR
2750,YES,YES
2751,OKAY,LOKIM
2752,YES YEAH MMM HMM,YESYEAH  MM
2753,MMM HMM NO,M HMM NO
2754,MMM HMM OKAY UH NO NOT AT ALL,MM HMME NODKA TE MUTP BGROSE UM NO THATI NOW
2755,UH IT'S PATH,UH IT'S PATH
2756,WELL IF THAT ONE GAVE OFF ENERGY TO THAT AND THEN IT CAME UP TO HERE IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU GOTTA TURN THE SWITCH ONTO HERE AND THEN E ENERGY GO THROUGH THE METAL AND GO THROUGH THERE AND THEN GO BACK,WELL IF THAT ONE GAVE OF ENERGY DI THAT AND THEN IT CAME UP TO HEAR IT WOULDE WORK BECAUSE YO CAUTI TURN TH SWITCH ONTO HEAR AND THEN EMERGY GO THROUG THE METAL CAND GO THROUGH THERE AND THEN GOE BACK
2757,UH THEN IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH BRIGHTER TWO YEAH LIKE THESE TWO THERE'S TWO HERE,UH THEN IT ILL MAKE IT MUCH RIGHTER TO IF AT LIKE THIS TWO THERES TWO HEAR
2758,MMM HMM OKAY,HMM I
2759,IT WOULD GO IN HERE AND IT WOULD MAKE THAT ONE LIGHT UP,IF THO INSER AN YOU WULD MAKE THAT WONE LIGHTUP
2760,CAN'T GO OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES,I CAN'T GO OUT OF THE NEGATIVES
2761,PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AND OFF SWITCH,PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AND OFF SWITCH
2762,UH WHAT WE DID WAS WE TRIED THAT ONLY THERE WAS A BATTERY HERE AND A BATTERY THERE BUT WHAT I WAS THEN THINKING WAS WELL THEN WHY NOT MAKE THE BATTERIES CONNECT CAUSE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE N TWO MORE WIRES AND CONNECT THE BATTERIES SO THAT IT WOULD FIT AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE OFF TWO ENERGY SOURCES BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTERIES CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCES WILL MIX AND IT WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER,ELL WHAT WE DID WAS WE TRYIE THAT ONLY THERE 'S A BATTERY HERE AND HE BATTERY THERE BUT WHIT I WAS THEN THINKING WAS WELL THEN WYE NOT MAKE THE BATTERYS CONNECTCAUSE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYE WE COULD TAKE AN TWO MORE WIRES AND CONNECT THE BATTERIES SO THAT IT WULD FIT AND THEN IT WULD MAKE OFF TWO ENERGY SOURCES BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTERIS CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCES WILL MIX AND IT ILL MAKE IT BRIGTER
2763,BYE I WANNA SEE NO I HAVEN'T,HI HOW WINT TO SEE NO I HAVEN
2764,YES MMM HMM,YES IT'S URKMM HMM
2765,BECAUSE IT GOES IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT MMM HMM YES THEY ARE,BECAUSE IT GOES IN THE CIRCLE T EPEERS MM HMM YES THEY ARE
2766,DEPENDING ON UM HOW MANY LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES YOU USE LIGHT BULBS PRETTY MUCH CAUSE IF THERE'S FOUR THEN THERE WOULD BE FOUR CIRCUITS,DEPENDING ON UM HOW MANY LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES  LIGHT BULBS PRETTY MUCH CAUSE IT THERE'S FORE HAND THERE BEFORE CIRCUITS
2767,THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU GO AGAIN HERE'S THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT'LL GO DOWN PAR WELL,THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU' GO AGAIN WEARS TAE LIGHT BULB THEN IT 'ILLGO DOWN YAS WELL
2768,WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VARY FROM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO A REGULAR CIRCUIT,WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VARRY FROM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO AREAULERSMF
2769,THEY DON'T WORK,THEY DON'T WORK
2770,THE OTHER WAY,GATHER WAY
2771,YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN,YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHNG WAN HAPPEN
2772,WELL UM,WELL UM
2773,GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES OUT,GOES INOR HEAR GOES IN THROUG HEAR GOES OUT
2774,PATHWAYS THERE'S UH THREE,PATHWAYS THERE 'S UH THREEY
2775,OKAY,OKAY
2776,YES,YES
2777,YEAH,YEAH
2778,THERE IS NO CIRCLE OR CONNECTION THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING,THERE IS NO CIRCLE OR CONNECTION THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
2779,YES THEY GOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T BOTH USING OFF OF THE SAME WIRE SO IT GOT BRIGHTER,YES THEK OUT BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEY WERN'T BOTH USING OFF OF THE SAME WIRE SO IT GOT BRIGHTER
2780,Y YEAH I THINK IT MIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEED THESE TO GO THROUGH HERE YOU ALSO JUST IT'LL FLOW BETTER I THINK,H YEAH I THINK IT MIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEED THESE TO GO THROUGH HER YOU ALSO JUST IT 'LL FLOW BETTER I THINK
2781,UM WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER BECAUSE EVEN IN THIS ONE IT GIVES OFF A LOT OF LIGHT BUT WITH THEY'RE TWO IT'D BE JUST LIKE THAT ONE IT'D BE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT,UM WELL I THINK WOULD BE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER BECAUSE WEWENT IN' THIS ONE IT GIVES OFF A LOT OF LIGHT BUT WITH THERE TWO IT'D BE JUST LIKE THAT ONE IT'D BE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT
2782,AND THEN IT'LL GO AGAIN AND THEN AGAIN THEN,AND THEN IT'LL GO AGAIN AND THEN AGAIT HORE
2783,THAT ONLY WITH TWO OF THEM THAT WERE BRIGHT SO JUST LIKE THIS ONLY BRIGHTER,THAT ONLY WITH TWO OF THEM THAT WERE BRIGHT SO JUST LIKE THIS ONLY BRIGHTER
2784,YES ONLY THESE WOULD PUT OFF MORE ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,YES ONLY THESE WOULD PUR OFF MORE ENERGYA SO I THOGT
2785,GOOD,GOOD
2786,YES,YES
2787,A SERIES CIRCUIT OKAY YEP THEN IT'D BE LIKE THAT LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE A SERIES CIRCUIT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT,A SERIES CIRCUIT LIE A CICUTIRCUITSYEUH THE BE LIKE THAT LIKE THAT THAT WULD BE A SERIES CIRCUIT  IRCUCE CIRCUIT YEIF FORIGHT
2788,OH YE WE TRIED THAT ONLY WITHOUT THAT,UM YS WE TRIED THAT ONLY WITH OUT THAT
2789,I WOULD STOP HERE I'D GO THROUGH AND THEN I'D GO BACK AROUND,I WULD STOP HERE I GO THROUGH AND THEN I GO BACK AROUND
2790,YEAH PARALLEL,M HUH OPARALLEL
2791,YES MMM HMM,YES MMM
2792,UH YOU NEED THE WIRES MMM HMM,ULH YEETWIRESMM
2793,WE ACTUALLY DID IT WITH THREE LIGHT BULBS WELL WE ALSO JUST WE JUST TAKE ANOTHER ONE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST KEEP ADDING ON ADDING ON ADDING ON,WE ACTULLY DID WITH THE REE LIGHT BULBS WELL WE ALL SO JUST WE' JUST TAKE ANOTHER ONE WHLL YOU DO IG DID JUST KEEP ADDING ON AGTING ON AGTING ON
2794,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S UM SURE WELL I'M GONNA DO IT IN A CERTAIN FORM IT GOES LIKE THERE'S THE BATTERY,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S UM SURE WELL I'M GOIN TO DO IT IN THE CIRANT FORM IT GOES LIKE THERE'S THE BATTERY
2795,OKAY,AM
2796,YES A SPONGE IS NOT A CONDUCTOR,YES A SPONGES NOT A CONDUCTOER
2797,BECAUSE IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE JUST LIKE THESE ARE ENERGY SOURCES,BECAUSE IT ISN'T HENNERGY SOURCE JUST LIKE THESE ARE ENERGY SOURCES
2798,SEPARATE UM MEANS THAT THE WIRES DON'T TOUCH,SEPARAT UM MEANS THAT THE WIRES DON'T TOUCH
2799,BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT METAL IF IT'S SAY UH SPONGE IT WON'T GO THOUGH BECAUSE WHEN METAL GOES THROU WHEN ENERGY GOES THOUGH METAL IT GOES THROUGH QUICKER AND IT DOESN'T UM IT JUST GOES THROUGH A LOT QUICKER BECAUSE IT IS WELL,BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT METAL IF IT'S Y THERE SPONGE IT WON'T GOE THROUGH BECAUSE WHEN METAL GOES TWHEN ENERGY GOES THRUGH METAL IT GOES THROUGH QUICKER AND IT DOESN'T UM IT JUST GOES THROUGH A LOT QUICKER BECAUSE IT IS WELL
2800,YES,YES

2802,THE EXTRA THE EXCESS YES THE ACCESS WIRE,THE MEXTURE THE EXES YES THE EAXES WAIRE
2803,MMM HMM YES,MM YES
2804,YES UM,YES UM
2805,YES MMM HMM YEAH TODAY WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE AND ELECTROMAGNET MMM HMM THAT IS WHERE YOU MAKE A MAGNET WITHOUT USING A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET,YES  M HMM YEAH SO PAY WERE TRYING TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET M THAT IS WHERE YOU MAKE A MAGNET WITH OUT UTING A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET
2806,YES,YES
2807,THEN WHAT WE DID IS WE TOOK THE UM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU CALL IT BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S METAL AND IT HAS A LITTLE TOP A LITTLE ROUND TOP AND IT HAS THREE PLASTIC OR RUBBER CIRCLES AND SO WHAT WE DID WE W WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND IT AND WE COVERED THIS LITTLE RUBBERS AND THAT WORKED MORE BECAUSE IT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY IT WORKED BETTER BUT IT WORKED A LOT BETTER IF WE COVERED IT AND SO WE WOULD WRAP IT EACH TIME WE'D WRAP IT TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND IT WOULD PICK UP MORE AND MORE OF THE LITTLE SN WASHERS,THEN WHAT WE DID AS WE TUK THE UMW NOT QUIGHT SUR WHAT YOU CALL IT BUT LIKE METAL AND IT HAS AITTLE TOP A LITTLE ROUND TOP AND IT HAS THREE PLASSED IT OR RUBBER CIRCLEAND SO WHE WE DID IS WE WRAPD THE WIRE AROUND IT AND WE CUFFERED THE S LITTL WRUBBERS AND THAT WORKED MORE BECAUSE IT I'M NOT QUAIGHT SHURE WY IT WORKED BETTER BUT IT WORKED A LOT THAT AT OR IF WE COVERED IT AND SO WE WOULD WRAP IT EACH TIME WED WAP IT TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND ITWULD PICK UP MORE AND MORE OF THE LITTLE WASHERS
2808,MMM HMM AND TWO ON THE SWITCH YES CAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO S FOR ONE TO GO HERE AND AND THEN THERE'S THAT AND THEN THERE'S THAT SO WE STICK IT IN THERE,MM MAN TWO ON THE SWITCH YES CAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE TO S FOR ONE TO GO HERE AND THEND THERE'S THAT AND THEN THERES THAT SO WE TICK IT IN THERE
2809,YES,YES
2810,THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH THERE INTO THE THE NAIL AND THEN GOING JUST PICK UP THE WASHERS,HE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH THEARE INTO THE THE NAIL AND THEN GOING TO PICK UP TWASHERS
2811,MMM HMM YES THANK YOU,MM HMM YES THANK YOU
2812,NOPE WE'VE TRIED,NO WE'F STRIE
2813,YES LIKE,YES LIKE
2814,THE MORE POWERFUL IT BECOMES,THE MORE POWERFUL BECOMES
2815,YEAH MMM HMM,YEAH MM H
2816,NO WE JUST WHAT WE DID WAS WE JUST WRAPPED THE THINGS AROUND WITH NO ENDS,NO WE JUST WHAT WE DID IS DE JUST WRAP THE THINGS ROUND UNE WITH NO ENDS
2817,YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT,YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT
2818,MAKING CARS I THINK MAYBE MAKING CARS UH HUH OR CRUSHING CARS ELEVA YEA L ELEVATORS,MAKING CARS I THINK THEAYVE BEN MAKING CARBARS HUM OR CROSHING CARS ELL OF IT YEAL ELLIAVATERS
2819,HELLO AWESOME,AU O US
2820,CIRCUIT,CIRCUIT
2821,YES,YES
2822,YES,YES
2823,WHAT I REMEMBER WITH TEMPORARY MAGNETS IS AS SOON AS YOU THEY DON'T STAY FOREVER SO,WHAT IVERE MEMBER IT TEMPERY MAGNETS IS AS SOUNE AS YOU THEY DON'T STAY FOR EVERSO
2824,LIKE THOSE BIG BATTERIES ABOUT THAT BIG LIKE THOSE ONES YEAH OF YOU PUT WIRES ON THOSE BACK UP AND IF YOU HAVE A SMALL LITTLE LIGHT BULB SAY GOODBYE SO,LIKE THESIS BIG BATTERIES ABOUT THAT BIRE LIKE THOUSE ONES YEAYEAH IF YOU PUT T WIRES ON THEOS BACK UP AND IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER LIGHT ROB SAGOLD BY SO
2825,THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE CRANE YEAH GOES INTO THE MAGNET AND MAKES IT ELECTRIC MMM HMM AND TURNS IT ON YEAH,THE ELECTRTRICITY FROM THE FROM THEY CRAIN YEAH GOES INTO THE MAGNET AND MAKES IT ELECTRO HM AND TURNS IT ON YEAH
2826,YE UH NOT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IT WAS LIKE A MONTH AGO AT LEAST,YEUH NOT A CRUPELE WEEAKS AGO IT WAS LIKE A MUNTH AGO IT SESE
2827,WELL IT WAS STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ENERGY IT CAN GIVE,WELL IT WAS STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE YOU RAPPIT AROUND THE MORE ENERGERGY IT CAN GIVE
2828,WELL I'M NOT SURE BUT I WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET WITH TWO BATTERIES,WEL I'M NOT SURE BUT I CUD BE LOKT ENG FORWARD TTO TRING TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET WITH TWO BATTERIES
2829,UH YEAH YES WHEN WE TOOK SO PRETEND THIS S IS A BIG LITTLE RECTANGLE THING OKAY AND HERE IS THE SWITCH SURPRISES IS THERE ARE LITTLE THINGS WHERE YOU PUSH DOWN AND THE WIRE GOES THROUGH THOSE THINGS GOT REALLY HOT BECAUSE OF THE D CELL I BELIEVE BUT THAT WELL I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS THAT THE D CELL WAS GIVING OFF SO MUCH ENERGY TO THE UM TO THE SWITCH BECAUSE IT WAS ON OFF THE THE SAME WIRE SO THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT BUT IT STILL WAS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR ME YES YEAH JUST LIKE THAT HEATER NO I'M NOT SURE IT'S BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE AN END LIKE THOSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE AN END IT DOESN'T PER SWAY AS MUCH ENERGY SO I DON'T THINK,A YEUH YEAS WHEN WE TOCK SO PROTEND THIS IS A BIG LITTLE WORK THINGAL THING IRA AND HER IS THE SWITCH THAT IS SURPRISEIES THERE LITTL THINGS BUT YOU PUSH DOWN IN HE WIRE GUBS STIFTUR THOSE THINGS GOT REALLY HOTBECAUSE OF THE D CELL I BELEAVE BUT THAT WHELT I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON ON WAS THAT THE D CELL WAS GIVING OFF SO MUCH ENERGY TO THE UM TO THE SWITCH BECAUSE IT WAS ON OFF THE SAME WIRE SO THAT'S WHAT I THOT BUT IT STILL WAS THE LITTLE WIR FOR MAK YEAHS YEAH JUS LIKE THAT HEATER NO I'M NOT SURE IT'S BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVEAN END LIKE THOS IF IT DOESN'T HAVE AN END IT DOESN'T PERS WY AS MUCH ENERGY O I DON'T THINK
2830,YES YES THAT'S WHY THEY ALL WIRES HAVE THAT AROUND THEM,YES HMM YES THAT'S WHY THEY ALL WIRES HAVE THAT AROUND
2831,YEAH PRETTY MUCH,YEAH PRTY MUCH
2832,YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TOUCH IT,YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY I DON'T TOUCH IT
2833,YES,YES

2838,I SAW THE LITTLE THING GOING UP AND DOWN,I SAW THAT LITTELE TIN AND GOGOING UP AND DOWN
2839,AND THEN IT WORKS GOOD BUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY STRANGE WAS WHEN RIGHT AS WE OPENED IT IT WOULD STICK FOR LIKE A MILLISECOND AND THEN IT WOULD DROP IT'S BECA WELL I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE UM MY FRIEND SHE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD BECAUSE IT NEEDS A W IT TAKES TIME FOR IT TO N GET THE NOTICE TO STOP I GUESS,AND THEN IT WORKS AGAN BUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY STRANGE WAS WHEN RIGHT AS WE OPENED IT THEY OULD STICK FOR LIKE A MILLAO SECAND AND THEN THEY WULD DROP HT'S BECAUSE MIN WELL I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE UM MY FREND SHE TOLLD ME THAT IT WOULD BECAUSE IT MEANDS A IT TAKES TIME FOR IT TO GET THE NOTICE TO STOP I GESS
2840,THE OTHER TWO ENDS GO ON THE ENDS OF THE SWITCH,THE OTHER TWO EANS GO ON THE ENDS OF THE SWITCH
2841,MMM HMM YES I DID,MHYH YES I DID
2842,ALL WE DID WAS WE HAD THE D CELL BATTERY AND NOW THE WIRE WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT CAUSE IT LOOKS UM THE ENDS INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE LIKE THAT IT HAD TWO SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE STICKED TWO OF THOSE ONTO THE BATTERY WE STICKED THE OTHER TWO TO THE SWITCH WE HAD A SWITCH TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THEN WE TOOK THE UM,WALL WE DID S WE HAVE THE D SILL BATTERY AND NOW THE WIRE WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT CAUSE IT LOOKS UM THE ENDS INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE LIKE THAT IT HAD TOSO WHAT WE DID WAS WE STICK TWO OF THOSE ON TOTHE BATTERY WE STICK THE OTHER TWO TWO THE SWITCH WE HAD A SWITCH TO TURN ON AND O THEN WE TOK THE UM
2843,IT WOULD GO UP,IT WOULD GO UP
2844,IT'D BE EVEN EVEN STRONGER,IT WOULD BE EAVEN EATHER SUM

2852,YES YES,YES YES
2853,THE PLASTIC IS THERE TO PROTECT YOU,THE PLASTTICAUS THEY'RE TO BROTECTIURE
2854,IT WORKED REALLY GOOD WE WERE ABLE TO PICK UP FIFTEEN SMALL LITTLE WASHERS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNET,IT WORKED REALLY GOOD WE WE'RE ABLE TO PICK UP FIFTEEN SMALLITLE WASHERS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNE
2855,YES AND THEN THE X,YES AND THEN THE ACXS
2856,BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THE CIRCUIT IT HAS STILL HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF ENERGY AND WHEN IT GOES THERE AND IT LETS GO IT STILL HAS ENERGY AND THEN IT STOPS THE ENERGY SAYS OH WAIT WE NEED TO STOP,BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THE CIRCUIT IT HAS STILL HAV THE HAL BUNCHO ENERGY AND WHEN IT GOES THERE AND IT LET'S GO ITSTILL HAS ENERGY AND THEN IT STOPS THENERGY SAYS O WEIGHT WE EED THE STOPP
2857,ANOTHER THING DID SURPRISE ME WHEN WE TOOK THE UM WHAT CAN I USE,I NOW THE THING DID SURPRIZSED MEWHEN WE TOCK THE UM CANI USE
2858,NO YES,NO YES
2859,TO THAT BALL YEAH AN ELECTROMAGNET,TO THAT BALL YEAH AN ELECTROMAGNET
2860,YES I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD PICK UP SO MANY JUST BY TIGHTENING IT AND MAKING IT MORE AND MORE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT,YES I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD PICK UP SO MANY JUST BY TIGHTNING IT AND MAKING MORE AND MORE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
2861,YES IT'S REALLY BIG IT'S IT'S UM I THINKS IT'S EITHER A VERY POWERFUL MAGNET OR AN ELECTRO I'M NOT QUITE SURE,YES IT'S REALLY BIG IT'S IT'S UM I THINK IT'S EATHERE A VERY POWERFOL MAGNET OR AN ELECTER I'M NOT QUIGHT SURE
2862,IT'S STRIPPED,IT'S STRICKED

3420,WELL WE HAD THREE CUPS OF WATER AND FIRST WE WOULD PUT OUR FINGERS IN AND ESTIMATE WHICH ONE WAS THE HOTTEST AND WHICH ONE WAS THE COOLEST AND THEN WE WOULD ACTUALLY USE THERMOMETERS,WELL WE HAD THREE CUPS OF WATER IN FIRST WE WOULD PUT OUR FINGERS IND AND ESTIMATE WHICH ONE WAS THE HOTTIST IN WHICH ONE WAS THE COOALLEST AND THEN WE WOULD ACTUALLY USE THERMOMETERS
3421,WELL IF WE DIDN'T KNOW THEM THEN IT MIGHT BE HARDER ONCE WE POUR THEM TOGETHER TO GET THE ANSWER,WELL IF WE DIDN'T NOW THEM THEN IT MIGHT BE HARDER WHENS WE PORE THEM TOGETHER TO GET THE ANER
3422,OUR FIRST TEMPERATURES WAS B WITH THE ICE WATER WAS EITHER I THINK IT WAS ZERO DEGREES AND THEN WITH OUR WARM WATER IT WAS TWENTY ONE I THINK,OUR FIRST TEMPERATURES WAS B WITH THE ICSE WATER WAS EATHER I THINK IT AS YEU  DEGREES AND THEN WITH OUR WORM WATER IT WAIS TWENTY ONE I THINK
3423,WELL IF YOU MIX THEM IT IT WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE ALL WELL IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE ABOUT THE FIFTY OR FORTY OR IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER BECAUSE WHEN WE DID IT WE GOT EIGHT DEGREES CELSIUS,WELL IF YOU MIX TE IT IT WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE A WELL IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE ABOUT THE FIFTY OR FORTY OR IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER BECAUSE WHEN WE DID IT WE GOT EIGHT DEGREES CELSIUS
3424,WELL IT TELLS ME THAT ROBBIE GOT C A B BILLY C A B JAMIE GOT A C B AND PAT GOT C A B AND SO THERE ARE THE SAME NUMBER OF EACH SO THEY IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO TELL WHOSE WAS CORRECT,WELL IT TELLS ME THAT ROBE GOT C AY B BIALLY GOT C AY BEY J  GOT A CE B AND PAT GOT C AY B AND SO THEYRE ARE THE SAME NUMBER OF EACH SO Y IT'S A LITTLLE BIT HARDER TO TELL HOS WAS CORRECT
3425,YES OUR ANSWER ONCE WE MIXED 'EM SURPRISED ME AND THEN UM ALSO WHEN WE COMPARED OUR ANSWERS WHEN WE MIXED 'EM WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND SOME PEOPLE HAD LIKE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES AND YEAH THA,YES OUR ANSER WONS WE MIX THEM SURPRISED MEY AND THEN UM ALSO WHEN WE CANM PAIRE OUR ANSERS WHEN WE MAXE THEM WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSERS AND SOME PEOPLE HAD LIKE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES AND YEAH THAT
3426,WELL THE THERMOMETER HELPS YOU MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THINGS IT YOU WOULD PUT IT IN LIQUID OR YOU COULD HOLD IT IN THE AIR AND EVENTUALLY THE MERCURY INSIDE OF IT WOULD EITHER EXPAND AND COME UP THE TUBE OR COME DOWN AND THEN YOU WOULD READ THE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS,WELL THE THERMOMETER HELPS YOU MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THINGS IT YOU WOULD PUT IT IN LIQUID OR YOU COULD HOLD IT IN THE AIR AND VENCHUALLY THE MERKCURY INSIDE OF IT WOULD EATHER EXSPAND AND COM UP THE TUBE OR COME DOWN AND THEN YOU WOULD RED THE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS
3427,UM WELL A AND C THEY'RE BOTH AT TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS SO THAT TELLS ME THAT THEY ARE TWENTY IS HIGHER THAN FIVE SO THEY ARE THE WARMEST AND B IS THE COOLEST,UM WELL  AND C THEY'RE BOUGTH THAT TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS SO THAT TELLS MY THAT THEY ARE TWENTY IS HIER THAN FIVE SO THEY ARE THE WORMEST AND B ITS THE COOLIUST
3428,YES WE ALSO RECORDED OUR MEASUREMENTS UP ON THE WHITE BOARD AND ALL THE OTHER TEAMS DID THE SAME THING AND THEY RECORDED THEIR'S TOO AND WE COMPARED OUR ANSWERS,YES WE ALSO RECORDED AR MEASUREMENTS APPON THE WIGHT BORD AND ALL THE OTHER TEMS DID THE SAME THING AND THEY RECORTED THERE'S TWO AND WE COMPEIRED OUR ANSERS
3429,WELL THE CUP ON THE FAR LEFT LOOKS LIKE THE WATER IN IT IS VERY WARM BECAUSE IT'S FIFTY CELSIUS AND THEN THE CUP ON THE FAR RIGHT HAS ICE IN IT SO IT'S COLDER AND IT'S TEN CELSIUS,WELL THE CUP ON THE FAR LEFT LOOKS LIKE THE WATER AND IT IS VERY WORM BECAUSE IT'S FIFTY CELSIUS AND THEN THE CUP ON THE FAR RIGHT HAS IC AND IT SO IT'S COLDER AND IT'S TEN CELSIUMS
3430,WELL THEY WERE EACH FILLED WITH UM DIFFERENT TEMPERATURED WATER SO B WOULD HAVE ICE AND THEN C WOULD BE WARMER AND THEN A WOULD BE THE WARMER AND THEN YEAH,WELL THEY WERE EACH FILLED WITH UM DIFFERENT TEMPERATURED WATER SO BE WOULD HAVE ICE AND THEN SEE WOULD BE WORMER AND THEN IT WOULD BE THE WORMER AND THEN YEAH
3431,WELL WE LEARNED THAT PARTLY HOW TO USE THERMOMETERS AND ALSO HOW TO MEASURE WATER WITH THEM,WELL WE LEARNED THAT PART LY HOW TO USE THERMOMETERS AND ALLSO HOW IT O MEASURE WATER WITH THEM
3432,WELL FAHRENHEIT IS HIGHER OR SO FOR EXAMPLE THE ROOM TEMPERATURE MIGHT BE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BUT IT WOULD BE UM LESS IN CELSIUS BECAUSE YEAH,WELL FARANT HIGHT IS HIER OR SO FORE EXAMPLE THE ROME TEMPERATURE MIGHT BE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES FARAND HIGHT BUT IT WOULD BE UM LESS IN CELSIUS BECAUSE YEAH
3433,WELL IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE USED FAHRENHEIT WE WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND IT WOULD BE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO CONVERT THE FAHRENHEIT TO CELSIUS,WELL IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE USED FAIREN HIGHT WE WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFERENT ANSERS AND IT WOULD BE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO CONVERT THE FARENT HIGHTE TO CELSIUS
3434,I'M DOING GOOD,I'M DOING GOOD
3435,HE IS USING HIS FINGER TO TRY TO SEE IF HE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT WHICH ONE'S THE HOTTEST AND AND THEN IN ORDER TO THE COLDEST,HE IS USING HIS FINGER TO TRY TO SEE IF HE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT WHICH ONE IS THE HOTTST AND AND THEN IN ORTER TO THE COLDEST
3436,YES BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD MORE ICE WATER THAN HOT WATER AND THIS LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIXTY DEGREES,YES BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD MORE IC WATER THAN HOT WATER AND THIS LOOK LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIXTY DEGREES
3437,WELL ESTIMATING IS KIND OF LIKE GUESSING IT'S WHERE YOU KNOW SOME HINTS ABOUT IT BUT YOU HAVE TO GUESS P ON PART OF IT,WELL ESTIEMATING IS KIND OF LIKE GESING IT'S WHERE YOU NO SOME HINTS ABOUT IT BUT YOU HAVE TO GES ON PART OF IT
3438,WELL THE A AND THE C LOOK LIKE THE SAME TEMPERATURE AT TWENTY AND B IS THE COOLEST BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS,WELL THE Y AND THE SE LOOKS LIKE THE SAME TEMPERATURE AT TWENTY AND B IS THE COOALLEST BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS
3439,UM NO WHEN I DID IT MY GUESSES WERE NOT CORRECT,UM NO WHEN I DID IT MY GESSES WERE NOT CORRECT
3440,WELL CELSIUS IS THE METRIC SYSTEM WAY OF MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THINGS,WELL CELSIUS IS THE METRIC SYSTEM WAY OF MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THINGS
3441,PRISED ME,ROSE ME
3442,WELL AFTER WE DID THAT WE EACH GOT THERMOMETERS AND WE PUT THE THERMOMETERS IN EACH CUP AND WAITED UNTIL WE HAD THE MEASUREMENT AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT IT WENT C A B NOT A C B,WELL AFFTER WE DID THAT WE EACH GOT THERMOMETERS AND WE PUT THE THERMOMERS IN EACH CUP IN WEIGHTED UNTILL WE HAD THE MEASUREMENT AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT IT WENT SE A B NOT A CE B
3443,NO IT WAS NOT,NO IT WAS NOT
3444,WELL THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN LET'S SAY WOULD BE UP TO THE TOP SO RIGHT WHEN YOU OPENED IT IT WOULD THE SODA WOULD COME UP TO THE TOP,WELL THE CAPACITY OF A SODAKCANDEL SAY WOULD BE UP TO THE TOP SO RIGHT WHEN YOU OPENED IT IT WIT THE SODA WOULD COM UP TO THE TOP
3445,WE WOULD POUR IT INTO A CUP WITH MEASUREMENTS IN MILLILITERS WE WOULD MEASURE THAT AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH WE WOULD EITHER USE THE SYRINGE OR ANOTHER CUP,WE WOULD POR IT INTO A CUP WITH MEASUREMENTS AND MILLILITERS WE WOULD MEASUR THAT AND IF THAT WASN'T ENUFF WE WOULD EATHER USE THE SURRINGE OR A NOTHER CUP
3446,WELL WE WERE DOING MILLILITERS AND LITERS SO WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SODA CAN'S CAPACITY WAS AND HOW MUCH THEY FILLED THE COMPANIES FILLED UP TO AND THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IF THEY FILLED IT TO CAPACITY THEY COULD GIVE YOU MORE,WELL WE WERE DOING MILLILITERS AND LITERS SO W WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SO THE CANDES CAPASCITY WAS AND HOW MUCH THEY FILL THE COMPINES FILLED UP TOM AND THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IF THEY FILLED IT TO CAPACITY THEY COULD GIVE YOU MORE
3447,WELL A WHILE AGO IN MATH WE WORKED WITH SODA CANS YES,WELL A WILL AGO IND MATH WE WORKED WITH SODA CANDS YES
3448,WELL WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT THE COMPANIES WOULD DO THAT SO YOU WOULD BUY MORE BECAUSE YOU WOULD FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SO YOU WOULD COME BACK AND BUY MORE SO THEY WOULD EARN THE COMPANIES WOULD EARN MORE MONEY,WELL WE CAME OF WITH THE I DEA THAT THE COMBINES WOULD DO THAT SO YOU OULD BYE MORE BECAUSE YOU WOULD FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUFF S YOU WOULD COME BACK AND BY MORE SO THEY WOULD URN THE COMINES WOOULD EAURN MORE MUNNY
3449,WELL WE POURED THE WATER INTO THE SODA CAN SO IT WAS FILLED TO CAPACITY AND THEN WE DUMPED IT OUT AND MEASURED IT,WELL WE PORED THE WATER INTO THE SODA CAND SO IT WAS FILLED TOT CAPASCITY AND THEN WE DUMPED IT OUT AND MEASURED IT
3450,WELL MILLILITERS IS A METRIC WAY OF MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID SO THEY'RE PRETTY SMALL,WELL MILLILITERS IS UH MEASURICA WAY OF MEASURING THEY AMOUNT OF LIQUID SO THERE PRETTY SMALL
3451,WELL IF WE USED OUR WAY OF MEASURING WE WOULD ALL HAVE GOTTEN DIFFERENT ANSWERS LIKE I SAID BEFORE AND IT WOULD BE HARDER,WELL IF WUSE OUR WAY OF MEASURING WE WOILD ALL HAVE GOTAN DIFFERENT ANSERS LIKE I SAID BEFORE AND IT WOULD BE HARDER
