1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANYTHING
1553,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL
1554,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A,THA SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A
1555,THAT THREE WIRES ON SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE,THAT TH THREE WIRES ON ONE SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT 'S SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE BATTERY
1556,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CANNOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK
1557,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS N

1559,THE SECOND CIRCUIT,THE SECOND CIRCUIT
1560,GOOD,GOOD
1561,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN GLOW THROUG
1562,THEN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT'S NOT BURNT OUT,AN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT IS NOT BURNED OUT
1563,WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS,WHEN IT BREAK A
1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,WE KNOW THAT SERIES ARE  DESTEER
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,THE FILAMENTR IS WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS TET ONCE YOU GET A RIT FILAMENT THE WA THE WLBWATER WORKING
1567,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE CELL THE ENERGY
1569,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP
1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT THE END
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OPEN
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,I KNOT THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES THAHAHTHTHT
1574,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BOLBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBUM
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN ARE A BIG CIRCLE PLUCK ADIN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINUS CIRCUIT

2120,THEY ARE FLYING IN A CIRCUIT AND THERE ARE ENERGY,THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
2121,NOTICED THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING INTO AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT,NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING A A IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
2122,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2123,WIDER OR BEING VERY COMPLICATE,BRIGHTER OR BE EASIER TO COMPLICATE UP
2124,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DISCONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON I FORGOT YOUR QUESTIONS ANYWAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DISCONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON BUT I FORGOT YOUR QUESTION ANYWAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT
2125,OKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN A,OKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN
2126,BECAUSE THEY DO,I BECAUSE THEY DO
2127,OH NO AS WE,I DON'T KNOW ASKED
2128,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
2129,KNEW,NOW
2130,YEAH THIS IS THE CAT CLOCK,IT IS THE CATCLOCK

2135,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN VERY RADICAL WAY,I NOTICE THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RADICAL WAY
2136,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
2137,IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE THE THUNDER YEAH YEAH EXACTLY THUNDER HA LIKE THAT LIKE YEAH,IT'S BECAUSE IT IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED IN STUFF LIKE INDR YEAH YEAH EXACTLY INDR HAH LIH WHAT L YEAH
2138,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF,I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE IT IS TUFF
2139,I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT,I NOTICE THAT IS IT THAT IT IS A CIRCUIT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
2140,THEY ARE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND BUT IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED FOR ME AND,THEY'RE COMPARED UM BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND THAT IT'S IN A MORE COMPLICATED FORM AND RICAL
2141,NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD,NOTICE THAT  IS GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RED
2142,IT IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND THE STUFF,NERGY IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND STUFF
2143,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
2144,WHAT,WHAT
2145,DON'T,DON'T
2146,THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2147,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE AMOUNT IT'S GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS,THIS FORMATION IS ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUS THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE A AMOUNT IS GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE THAN PEOPLE UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANT
2148,GOOD,GOOD
2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,WELL THE SOIL DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AT GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO
2151,WE BEEN,THE Y WERE DOING
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL
2153,I SEE WATER IN SOIL,I SEE WATER AND SOIL
2154,YEAH,YEAH
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GET ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEANE
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SALT THE SOIL KEEPS EVR OTHE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP TH THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN FLO SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,WELL THE SOIL IS UM ABSORBES MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS AN AND BUT IT WON'T LET YOU'L ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S CLOSE TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT
2158,GOT WET,IT
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOILS AND GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOES IT IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WE GRAPED GRAPEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I OBSERVED THAT UM YU UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE PODTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE ITS R AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE P POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANT TO SAVE IT AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SOI THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DITA
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER CAN STILL GO AWAYIN BECAUSE THE WATER JUST FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER IN THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER AND SOIL
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL D THE SOIL DROPS LOWER
2168,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THEN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SOY IU CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LD JUST LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,BECAUSE UM SOMETIMES THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROWS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT AN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT
2171,BYE,BYE
2172,YEP YEP,YEP YEP
2173,WELL THE GRA THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOIL'S WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT U ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS IT ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUGH,WELL THE GRAV THE I MEAN THE SOIL  THE SOILS WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT UP ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH JIPS ON THE ROCK THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUG
2174,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GE AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'D BE GREAT,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOU COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM G AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAUND SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THATW'LL BE GREAT
2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER DRAINS WITH UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF O WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT
2176,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESN'T IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T UM WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON 'EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,WHEN YOU POUR ON TO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOES IT IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL THE ROCKS CAN UM  YOU POUR WATER ON EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES
2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AN THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUN THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL
2178,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WEL TURUR AND SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN
2179,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER
2180,UHM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK,IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK
2181,UHM WELL UHM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE,UM WELL UM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE
2182,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE
2183,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BALL,IT DOESN'T SHOP RED OVER THE BLUE BALL
2184,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE
2185,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT,WELL I NOTICED THAT THERE IS SOM WHITE LIGHT
2186,GOOD,GOOD
2187,SO WHEN THE WHITE UHM LIGHT SHINING ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,SO WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ON TO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2188,WELL UHM THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL BECAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK IT JUST LOOKS BLACK,WELL THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN I GOES TO THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO  LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL CAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK JUST LOOKS BLACK
2189,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT IS ONLY SHOWING BLUE
2190,BECAUSE THE GREEN LIGHT IS GREEN,AS THE GREEN LINE IS GRE
2191,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY UHM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL THEY ARE YELLOW,THE LIGHT RAY THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY ECOMING OUT OF THE BALL THEYRE YELLOW
2192,RED,RED
2193,UHM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,UM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ON TO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2194,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL
2195,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT AROUND,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT LOOK ROWN
2196,WELL SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB,L SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB
2197,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UHM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UHM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK
2198,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT
2199,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THAT COLOR TOO,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER WOULD THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THEIT COLOR TO
2200,SO WHEN WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL UHM THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAME WITH THE BLUE SO ONLY YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BALL AND ONLY BLUE COMES THROUGH FOR THE BLUE BALL BLUE BALL,SO WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL THE OTHER COLOR TOR THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND THE SAME WHIT THE BLOE SO NTE YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BELL AND ON THE COMES THROUGH THE THE BLUE BALL THEBLUE BALL
2201,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UHM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT AS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT WITH THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
2202,COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH,THE COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH
2203,IT'S TURNING BLACK,IT'S TURNING BLACK
2204,SO UHM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT,SO UM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT
