209,WITH THE PLUNGER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON IT EACH PLUNGER FULL IS FIFTY,WITH THE PUNGER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON EACH PLUNGERFUL IS FIFTY
210,IT WAS JUST TWO HUNDRED UH NOT TWO HUNDRED LITERS TWO HUNDRED,IT WAS  TWO HUNDRED AND NOT TWO HUNDRED LITERS TWO HUNDRED
211,IT'S LIKE A HOLDING A THOUSAND REINS RAISINS IN YOUR HAND RAISINS,IT'S LIKE HOLDING A THOUSAND RAINS RAGUCISM IN YOUR HAND RAISONS
212,WELL IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING LIQUID GRAMS WEIGHT,WELL IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING LIQUID GRAM WEIGHT
213,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW HOW MANY UM,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW HOW MANY UM
214,YEAH AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY IT'D FILL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY MMM TWO HUNDRED,YEAH AND IT  WE SAW HOW MANY IT W'D FILL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY UM TWO HUNDRED
215,HMM OKAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO,OKAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO
216,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME,IT MADE ME THINK THA YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME
217,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GONA BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT AND MOUTH TOO
218,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS IN ESTIMATING IS N A FULL I IT'S LIKE A GUESS
219,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,WEAR SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH GLASS
220,A HAN B A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TWENTY CENTIMETERS,A HAND BHAD A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LEKE LIKE CENTIMETERS
221,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A ME THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN A METER SORRY,THERE'S TEN METERS IN AND A MET THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN A METER SORRY
222,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES,YES WHAY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES LIKE THAT PIECE OF DOEST
223,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE  WE HAD TO MEASURE IT
224,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZE STRAWS
225,A HUN A HUNDRED YEAH AND THAT EQUALS A THOUSAND MMM HMM,A HUN A HUNDRED YEAH AND THAT EQUALS A THOUSAND M HM
226,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LITER TEN OF THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUALS ONE LITER,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LITER TEN OF THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUALS ONE LITER
227,WELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER WE HAD,WELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER WE HAD
228,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T  I DON'T ONLY REMEMBER TIVALL YER
229,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING  PLAY WITH THE WATER
230,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS O FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER
231,WELL UM WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE,WELL I WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE
232,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
233,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAPP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCE
234,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,OU ACOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THEIT
235,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU'RE WANTAN TO MAKE YOUR ELECTROMAGNETROIASID MORE BATTERIES FACING  POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
236,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THE MOREUM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING THE STRENGTH IF IT'S GETTING  MORE FORCE INTO IT
237,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT I SYN ABOT A MLAR GRAPH ISU NUMBERS
238,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,UM IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A BASING WTER AND ICASING WRE
239,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING THROUGH LIND A LIGHT BULB   BUB MU SHINING ON THE LIB
240,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS RIGHT,IT' DIFFERENT BECAUSE U I BE JUST HAVE ONE THE ELECTRICITY WILL RUN OUT AND THERE'S CERTAING OF  KINDS OF DIFFERENT FU THAT AN INSIDE IT STRIKS BRIGH
241,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THET ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THEHE LIGHT BULB
242,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING  SIENCE IS LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
243,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT O THE LIGHT WILL  BE
244,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE TI SAYS RED POS TO BE RED
245,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT  TO A PERSON
246,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIHKE YEP OMP BASHING OFF OF OBJECTS THROU OT THE COLOR BLUE
247,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFFM LIGHT GREEN AND M ORANGE BO BCAUSE YOU CAN ONLY USE THE LIGHT
248,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,N ONES BER T WASHERS TO BREAK IT
249,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS UNDER THE PAPER  THE PAPER CLIP IS ON TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUNT
250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN THI JUST ADID WHEN THE WASHE IT BROKE ETS FA BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE U THE SPEACES MADE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSEARVE HAPPENING IS LIKE G TMPRESSING THE WASHERS GO IN
253,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,WATER DOESIT MAKES THEA MAGNET MAKES THE AMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
254,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THEABOUT TO S I THE MAGNETTISM OF THE ATLY ISFOCTOUGH
255,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP TO HO MANY WASHERS IT CAN GO UP TO THE IT BROKEN ALL
256,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNE MIXTURE THROUGH AND I JUST REALLY REALLYN GT DOWN HAT TOES MA
257,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,IT IS UP THAT THAT WITH THAT IINE THINGS T
258,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IS ANY TURM E MAGNETS ON IT TT REACTS LIKE
259,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHAT BAISE OIIS HOLDER TE P IN THA AI
260,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE JUST SEE THE SAME THING YOU O REAIN ME LAST NIME
261,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,MORE ARE YOU PSIPTROING ME MO BECAUSE ALI SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THE NAIL AND THE PAPERCLIP
262,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WHAT S HAPENI IS IT STICKING TO A NAIL AND ITS CONNECTE TO PAPERA
263,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,ON O THE MAGNET DROPPD O ANDO THE TABLE AND THEN THE MAGNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETS CONNECTING IT AND HOLD
264,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE I CAUSTIL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNET FORCE IS SO LIKE IT'S A STRONG
265,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS REVER FROM THE NAIL AND THROUH THE NAIL LOS ITS MAGNETISM
266,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
267,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD  PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
268,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT IS SHOWING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM
269,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETTISM FORCES OFF AND BECAUSE IT A MAGNET IS MAKING IT
270,THE FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER AN OTOR MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
271,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS LIGHT ET UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY TO GO
272,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOTS OF TE ELECTRICITY GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND ROUND LIK THE LIGHT BULB
273,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT B
274,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHEN IT WHATEVER SID YOU JUST SWITCH IT TO IT STILL WORKS THE SAME LIG
275,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOES IN'T A CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
276,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WHA ONE WIREIS HITTING THROUGH THE PIEACE OF WIRE ONE IS HITTING TO THE BAS WIRE
277,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,SOWHAT I NOTICED A AT TO SET UP BCAUS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH BT WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BUL
278,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO MEAD IS A CIRCUIT GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE LEG I WITH THE ELECTRICITY
279,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
280,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS
281,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT BOUT H CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'SU AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
282,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,IT ACTS TO MAGNET CTD O PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IROT
283,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTI THEU WIRE ISU CLOSED
284,UM THE ROLE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SO,HAA AL  AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT ISSOV
285,SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL,TIK SHE'S REFLECTING AND THE SUNLIGHT TO A MIRR THE WOVING AMIA AND T IT SHOWS IT ON THE WA
286,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF O THE MA WHICH GIVES  HIM SO HE CA'TSEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
287,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT UM REFLECTIONS THERE ARE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE IT SHINE BRIGHTER,BY HOW THEY DIFFERE REFLECTIONS THEE ARE THEY WERE THEY'RE A BUL TO SE THE SAPRETER
288,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND IT'S SETTING TO THE STAR,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS DO WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING NOG DIFFERENT MIRORS AND ITS SETTING TO THE STAR
289,THE GUY HE FLICK THE SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHT,THE GUY HEFLICKED A SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
290,LIKE A MIRROR CAUSE SOMETIMES REFLECT IT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,LIKE A MIRCOSOMETIMES REFLECTING AND GO TO THE CENTEROR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
291,WHAT I KNOW IS UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULB LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IT ONE,WATER  KNOW IS THE CERTAIN LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS ANO ONE SPOK
292,IF ITS AND IN CONNECTS IF THIS HE DOES IN AND THEN A DOES EITHER,IF IT'S ENSE CONNECTS IF IT'S ESIUS IT DOESN'T AND IF IT'S NN A IT DOESN'T EITHER
293,I THINK WHAT IS ALL ABOUT IS SHE TRYING THE FINAL WAY I GUESS NORTH OR SOUTH,I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUESTIONS IN THE EARTH
294,WHAT YOU THING MORE THAN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB WENT OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECT,WHAT IU CAN PLIP THE LIP PICTURE  O WEL IN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB BRINKS OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECT THE RU BECAUSE THEY'RE NO O NETED WITH THE OTHER
295,BEESLY WIRE THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDLE THING,TLUG IS NOT LAIGHDE UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE METAL THING
296,LAST YEARLY MEANS THAT ELECTRICITY WHAT GO OTHER ONE IS ELECTRICITY THAT EASY,AI I MEANS THAT TO MUCH ELECTRICITY I TROUGH OTHER INETINEUELECTRICITY THAT EAS
297,THE WIRE THE ELECTRICITY THOSE THAT'S GOING IS BECAUSE AN LIGHT BULB OF OUT,THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRICITY I LOWS TOP GOING IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB BULB BURNS OUT
298,WHAT I THINK MORE HAPPENS IS ELECTRICITY GOES STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND LIGHT BULB IS STOP STOP LIGHTING UP,WHAT I THINKA LITTLE HAPPEN IS  ELECTRICITY WI WI STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND THE LIGHT BULB STOP STOP LIGHTING UP
299,HAPPENS IS AND THE FILM WAS GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND WHAT IS ACTION,WRAPPENS IS  A REPEAT AND THE FILAMENT WILL GO DON DOWN DON DO ANDO  INTERRUTIO
300,IT MAY BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE A CONNECT INTO LINE THE,IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT THE NEXT IT'L LIGHT UP WON' BREAK THAT
301,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THAT IS NO LIKE I MEAN,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS THIS BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN ELECDY TOTRA
302,HE REASON LIKE THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEM FINAL RECHARGE IN THE WIRE LIKE ITS,THE REASON WHY I THINK THAT IS BARNIE IT'S BECAUSE UMIS FINALY ITACHING THE WIRE LIKE IT SUPPOSED TO
303,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THERE REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH DIFFERENT NEW ONE,WHAT IS BEING SHOWNY IS THEY REPLACE HE BATTERY WITH THE DIFFERENT NEW ONE
304,I WILL CHECKS BY LIGHT BULBS I GUESS TWO OR ONE LIGHT BULB AND MORE LIGHTUP WORK,AL TES A CI CII SEN IS FIVE LIGHT BULBS AND I GUESS TO WHAT LIGHT BULB AND B  LIGHT UP O THAT'S
305,WHAT WE NOT DIFFERENCED BUT LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY HE WAS SWITCH SIDE,WHAT WE HAD THAT THE SWICHIELECTRICITY NOT GONGL  A HE LIGHT BUL  DEFRNTH SWITCH I SAI
306,WHAT HAPPENING THIS ENERGY IS JUST WASTING ON INTO THE AIR BECAUSE THOSE NOW ELECTRICITY INTO,WHAT HAPPENES IS THE ENERGY S JUST PATING OIN TO THE AIR BECAUSE THERE'S NO WER TO O ELECTRICITY INTOX
307,CIRCUIT LIGHT IS THE SERIES AND IT ADD SUCH ONE WIRE CONNECTED,THE CIRCUITS IN TE CICIDLIGHT I HE SERIES  I AT LEAST HAS TO BE ONE WIRE CONNECTED
308,WHAT INTO THE ELECTRICITY WENT TO THE ONE OF THE CIRCUIT WENT TO THE ITS STOPPED WORKING,WELL IN THE ELECTRICITY BURNS OUT ONE OF THE CIRCUIT AND WHEN TIT BURNS ITOUT UM IT STOPED WORKING
309,HAVE BEEN WHEN I NOTICE ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB WILL WORK AND OTHER ONE HAS IS,S HAT I NOTICED THA BOTH A ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBAN WORK THEE OTHER ONE THA IS NTL
310,BUT I NOTICE ONE LIGHT BULB THIS LIGHTING UP THIS IT IS RIGHT,WHAT I KNOWTICEIS O LIKE ONE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP ANDTHEOER  BURT OUT AND IT'S NOT WORKING IOT
311,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE 'S NO MAGNET IN IT
312,AND NOTE FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NOT DISSOLVE,IN NODOR FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
313,THINGS THAT STICK MAGNET OR EITHER METAL AND ONCE USUALLY PACKED PLASTIC,THE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET ARE EITHER METAL AND THE ONES ARE USUALLY PR PLASTIC OR WIT
314,THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK,THE PAPER FASTIENER STAYS ON AND THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROC
315,IT GOES THROUGH HOW THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONE GOES BACK INTO IT,UIT GOES THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE LONES GOES BACK INTO IT
316,THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
317,WHAT THE HAVE THEY COMPARED IS SETUP DIFFERENTLY STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY,ONE HOW THEY COMPARE IS THEY'RE SENT UP DIFFERENT WAYS BU STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY
318,I THINK I GUESS THE WHY I AM THE MADE CHOICES,I THINK I GUESS THE BOTTOM AND THERE ARE MA CHOISES BUT
319,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WELL IN SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS  THEN ELECTRICITY AS STOP GOES STOP GO BUT IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT GLOS AGROUND AND MAKING BUN AND BACK TO I
320,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOUR AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT WELL THERE IS ONLY SUPOSED TO BE ONE
321,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,WHAT I NOTICE THAT THE ATHING IS THE ENERGY S RE D CONNECTION
322,WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WE IT'S BEST ONE NOW I GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THERE'S NOT WASTE EN ENERGY
323,THE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THE CONNECTED RIGHT,THE FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP BECAUSE THE WAY IS GOING CAUSE IT'S CONNECTED THE RIGHT
324,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,BAT I NOTICE THA ENERGY TI GOING ANTOTHE BATTERY TIT'S GOING INTO THE BATTERY
325,IF THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS,THE KINDS OF CIRCUITS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
326,THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS I THEY LIGHTS UP IT BURNS OUT AND YOU HAVE TO REPLECE ITH ENOTHER ONE
327,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE  CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE MORE
328,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,VE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE M PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUIT
329,OH SO IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND,UH SO IT'S GOINNA GO THROUGH OF THE BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND
330,UM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO,UM IT CAN GO TERY LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO
331,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT IT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP
332,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WILL FLOW THROUGH,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WILL FLOW THROUGH
333,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HIOK IT UP TO THE BASE
334,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH IS IT A CIRCUIT,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH THE LITTLE CIRCUIT
335,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT
336,IT MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,MATTER'S HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS MATE SOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS
337,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE TON NEGATIVE FIELDS
338,BECAUSE THE SOUTHS CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE THEY WOULD PUSH AWAY,BECAUSE THE SOUTH CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY
339,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
340,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELEC IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELEC IT'S LIKE WHAT YOUS TO GREWP ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
341,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVE THE OTHER
342,THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPERCLIP MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK,THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPER CLIP MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK
343,WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES 'EM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES,WELL THE MAGNET POCH IS PUSTING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES THEM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES
344,WELL BECAUSE THE DIS THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK,WELL BECAUSE THE D THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTALLY BIKK
345,ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON,THE ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
346,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
347,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH ABOUT MAGNETISM,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH LIKE MAGNETISM
348,THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH,THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH
349,WHEN IT'S ON IT'S OFF AND WHEN IT'S OFF IT'S ON,WELL PART OF IT'S WRONG IT DOESN'T
350,IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OTHER CIRCUITS USUALLY HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT WITHOUT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM,IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OTHER CIRCUITS USUALLY HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT WITHOUT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM
351,IT THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE,IT THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
