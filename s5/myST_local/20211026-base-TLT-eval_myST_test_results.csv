1,OKAY,HOKAY
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY ON'T GRASPS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THERE WAR JUST SERCOLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERY ONE WOULD STAR AT THER DES OR AT WHAT EVER IE THERE DOWING AND SWIMG I AND HOW MANY SWIMGS THEY GOT THEY WULD HAING AND ON ANDNUMBER YEAH YEAH
4,YEAH,YEA
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSERS AND SO YOU ACTUALY KNOW THIKE YOU WOUDN'T WANTED JUST SAY ALL THAT'S I KNOW THAT AND THEIN JUST FOR GET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTALY RECOR THE ANCSERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADED TWO PENISE AND THEN I THINK THE HOLL CAST WAS CANVINCE THAT IT DIDN'T MATER I'M KNOT SHURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEND AFTER THAT WE  SORT OF MOVE ON TO THE U LAINKTH OF THE STRING
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,UM EXPERMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START AT DIFFRENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE WAT IT BUT WE HADINTY MORE PENIS TO IT TWOO SO WESO OW ANLD MAKE A DIFRENTS I'M NOT SHUR IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YEAH  LITLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO TE THE NUMBUER LINE AND THAND THERE IS HORSE ONTOL LINES ACROST AND THEN WE HAD A TEACHER AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THA BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE RO ON ONE TIME ITWS UM LANKTHS ON THE OTHER SID IT WAS SWIMNGS SO LIKE FOR INCTENCE THEY DID'T LIKE UH TEN INCS TEN TENIMATERS I GS MAVB I' NATURE HOW MANY AND THEINI LIKE THEY WOULD POO A NUMBER TAND THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD POU THERE LAINGTH AN THEN THEY WOULD POOUT THE NUMBER THERE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE'S A HUDGE DN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN ICAUSE THE UE I GEST SOMEE JUST FOR GOT OR LIKED DIDN'T OW AND SO THEN WE TRID IT AGAIN THE NEXT AKE AND SO AFTER WE TRID AGAIN IT' SORT OF CAMVINCE US THAT THE SHOURTER IT WAS THE MORE SWIMNGS IT GOT THE LEST THE BIGERE IT WAS THE LEST SWIMNGS THIT GOTSO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRYE TO HOLD THEM UM IKE EXACTLY THE WAY URE GS WERE AURE JS AND WE WOUD HOLD THEM AND THEN UM THEN WE GEST HOW MANY WEEK CUD DO IN FIFTEEN SECENDS AND I GES ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRID ITAND LIKE MOST LY EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH TUH UM I THINK ITWS THIRTY TEEMBERS WE DID AT THERTY TEEMEDERS WEN AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRYE TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FAST TER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,M YHW<unk>DED GRASFPING  YESTEURDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,UM YES I HAVE ACTLY

15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T RALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,OK
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,W GT IT SORT OF GBLIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO ACTUALY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OU BIGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLING SMALL AND THAN LIKE THING THE THE LTE SWINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,UM PREALY MUCH IN THE SAINE PACE EVERY ONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DANDI
19,OKAY,HOKY
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,W YEAH AT FIRST WICH WE TRIE TO THINK WHIT COUD AND  THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UMLANKT UM UH STARTING PIN AND THEN UMUH LIKE THE FOR SED THY WOULD FRAND SO WE HAVEN'T TRYED THE FOR YET BUT I THINK THE FORS IS FORSE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFERENCE
21,YEAH,E
22,OKAY,
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW SO I EXPLING TO HERE AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENON WAS LIKE  SWIMING OBJECT AN HOW YOU MAKE UME IT WIGA STRING AND THEND YOU POULT A PAPPER CLIPE IN A PENY AND YOU WULD HATCH THE STRING TO THE PAPPER CLIPE AND AN PENY TO THE PAPPER CLIPE AND THEN YOU CAN SWIM IT IN STUF AND THEN IM THE I  I DIDN'T HALLER THIS BUT THE YOU GO TO MAKE YIT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THE THE PENJAM THE STRING OFE THE PEN AND THEN I'M TO MAKE THE STHE PENJULAN SWING Y SWIMGS AND FIFTEEN SECKENDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENJULAM STRING LONGER
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YES WETDON<unk>SO LIKE UUM WIVE IN SOMETIMES WE WE WOIR LIKE DOING EXSPEREMENTE WITH THEM WE WERE USNGLIKE WE WERE TRING A FIGER OUT WHAT WE COUD DO TO MAKE THE LIKE WE WRE TRASTING UUM IN FIFTEEN SECENDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HING MAN A PENTL ON THE EDOF AR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWIMGS WE CAD GE IN FIFTEEN SECENDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WER THAN WE TRIED TO DO LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVE AUR DOISK OR BUT BE UMTHE LO AR DUSS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETER AND SO IT DIDN' REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE  CHAP HAVING THE EXPERMENTE AN TILL EVERY ONE LIKE WAS WAS CANVINCT THAT IT DIDN' REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,HOGAY
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'T ENT<unk>YE
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SOPRES SPROBUBLY HAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFECT THE SWIMGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE AITE ELEVEN SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BUT YUSUALY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUST WANTED TO HELP  A GES IT''S
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE  SWIMG IT'S GOING BACK IND FORTH SO LIK STARTS HERE IT GO'S BACK AND THENIT COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWIMG YEAH
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE W WE SA WE LIKE WE WATCH BEFORE WE FLYWSO UM WE WACT ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER A AND THEN FL OP TO THE WAT NUMBER WENT TO HOW HIWENT AND AN WE WOULD BARK ALETL DO RIG THERE AND WE CAP DOING THAT AND THEND WE FINISH WHEN AND HAND WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WA LIKE THIS ATHA SOT OF SOM WER OUP IN STED OP TOWN
34,UM WE,AM W

44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHA WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK UM HOW WE ACTALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SPOSE TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL B OH THMUA DIFFRENT THINGU IS LIK AORK<unk>AOKISO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,EUM UM THER'E OG IND OF THING THA YOU DO THAT FACT OUTCOME OFE AND EXPERMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YAH IF WE HAVE A STAANDERYDTHING TO LOUSE ENDN WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VERYABALLES ARE SOMETHING THAT FECT OUTCOME ON OF ND EXPERMENT AND YOU THE EXN EXPERMENT IS THAT YOU YOUD HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY NEW THINGS AND WHEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPEND IN<unk>

53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,YEAH AND THEN AANY<unk>WE DID HADOIPO MARKS ON THE STICKS THAT'S ID LIKE SIX FIVE OR THREE TO AND WE WENT HOLTHE WAY FROM SIX TO OTHE WAY TO TO AND WHEN WE EAT
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,MORE ACTUALY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOS ARE SOME OTHER TO WANT OF TO
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SHIRE BBECAUSE WE ND WE GOT ORE INDOR AND STOF JUST WASN'T RITE
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,THEN WE WILD HAVE TO LOK AT THE ACORING IP THE FOUR BECAUSE WE MAD CORING IP AN WE ASTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL AEURE SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIE LETA THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX HOLLEWAY AND THE STAKE WAS HALLIEWAY AND WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRID CENIMATERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME E GOT A HUNDEREDND FIFTYAN THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT OF FOR HUNRED AND THIN THE FIFT TIME AND THEN WIT THAT' WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEND WE WE DID THAT WHA WE HADED ALDOS TO GETHER ON HE COUCHULATER AND I T VIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS AR RESOLT AND YEAS

897,NO BECAUSE ALL PA THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE IT'D BE SMALL,NO BECAUSE THERE'S MANY DIFFRENT SOISES O PAPPER CIPS BECAUSE IN YOR CACE ILD BE SMALL
898,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MATH MASS IS WITH WATER O A BOWL AND A VASE,HERO O MATORMAUH MAS IS WITH WATER O A BALL AND  BAPE
899,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRAM PIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OUR GRAM PIECES WE MEASURE LIKE E THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE GRAM PIECES,WHAT WE DID WITH PROGRYAMPIES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OR GRUM PIES WEN MAZGER LIKE THE PIZA WOOLD IT GLOVS THREE GRAM PIUES
900,WELL THE MASS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASS THAT THESE TAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT QUARTERS OF THIS TABLE,WTHE MAS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASTH THAT IS TAKES OP IS PROBLY ABOUT IT ORTERS OF THE STABLE
901,YES,YES

2006,CAN I HEAR MY,LIE B
2007,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,BECAUSE THE WY IF IT'S LIKE FORTY SEVENS IL DEFIN L CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN IN TW THA FAR AOWAY BU IF IT WAS LIKE FOURT FROM TEN THEYWIT MAKE A HUGE DIFERENCE
2008,YEAH,YEAH
2009,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,UH WE HAD TO DO I'M SORRY UH WE HAD A WE HAD TO DO FOR THE FRI STAGES I GES IND OUR FIRSTINE WOULD BEHADO DO FOUR FACS AN SIX TUNIIERS VERY CLOSE TO THE SN SCWER OBJECT RITTHERE AND THAT WE DID FIVE E WE DID FOUR AND WE THE THREE NWE DD TWO ANDU
2010,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,UM WNT FLAPER UM LIKE UM I LIKEN OEDAYC IN A HOUH STUF FLAYINGS LIKE A CANIPALL FO LIKE WARSE IND WA AND MWERE EXPEREMENTING WITH THE WEY UM THIS OBJECT WEURE FLINGING UP MAUSERING TABLIKE THEYRE DOING RIDE THERE
2011,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,YEAM UM LIKE WE CAN  DO TWO VERYBALLS BUT IT'S COMING TOGEATHER A'S ONE SO WORING HOW FAR INDOOR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFEC THE BALL
2012,CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET YOUR RESULT,US THAT'S ON THE WAING YOUR
2013,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WYES WE WIU MY TEACHERJUERS BWHEN WE STARTED AT THS EXPEREMEND WE DID TEN A TWENTY SEVEN YEALERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENY AND Y UM HAVE MORE MATHS O MINE OE OSS GO AS HI IN THE VERY BALBAL WORKING ONIS HOW FAR THI GOS IN OR OUT
2014,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE UMBC IT'S THE HOBSCLC AND THERES SIX TENIMATERS ON IT ANDTLE THESE TWO COD LIKE ONE TO THREE FORES
2015,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE UEN A MORE ACCURITE INSURT AS RESALTS SO THAT YOULD GET SEVEN TTM AND UH TEN ELEVEN OF THERTEM ANT T THREE FOR FIVE SO THAT YOU WOULD DEVIYDE
2016,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,UM LIKE HATHE WE SAT IT UP WE HAVE  STICK IGOOP O SANERS A PHIPSICAL STICK AND WEARE POLING IN IN AS FAR AS S YOU WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM AL DOMIN AND FOYITL AND WE WERE CIND OF CRUSHING IN TO A BALL UM BECAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEPE IT LIKE AECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IN TO A BALL IND MY CHANGE THE VERYIABALL AND THE GRUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBOUDY I SPUNING UP IND TO DOING AD DIFRENT VERYIABALL AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FARE THE BALLOS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HI THE BALLO IS IN SOME PEOPLE DOING HOW FARE THE STICK IISIN SOME PEOPLE DOING LIKE UM HOW ILY SEEYHOW I GOS SO UM U
2017,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,UH  THE FUPPER THE BOTM PANT O THE UPPER AND UM UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WHEN ABOVE A HUNDRD AND FIFTY CENMY URCH WHICH IS THE LEMIT OFE A MASERING U CAN I AK MASERING TAB
2018,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND UM SO WI UM AR GRUP IS STING HOW FU THE MORE OUTDIS LIKE THE MORE IS NTHOW FARE IT IS UUH THE MORE<unk>
2019,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVEN TEEN AND THEND YOU WUILL AT TDOORS ALL TOGETHER SO UM YOU WULL GET YOUR ANSER SO ONE TEVEN FIVE AST ONE THIRTY WAST ONE FIFTEEN AST ONE SEVEN TEEN
2020,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,RE TRING TO FIND THE RESOLTS SO THAT'S HOW MUC YHOWUR CAN TO DO IT AND UM WHAT EVER YOU DO BIDED BYE FOR I I'M NOT SHUR ABOUT THE SPORT BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE CHE TO SEE CAUCULATERS SOW AFTERE THE DMALL ON HE CAUCULAITER THAT'S CAN TO BE URESO CAN MXING MATH INTO THIES
2021,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEOPLE RETRSTN HOW FAR THO ARE LUMIN BOGOS  LIKE NOT OP BUY FAR IN DISTENTE UM I GES   WL THMCANS WE HAVE T YI<unk>
2022,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,MY GREP AND Y TOK A SMALL ALUMEN OBALL AND ME PLAYE IT LIKE SEE THE CORK E PLAE IT UM BOL OF TEN INCHES IN CRENCHT IT AND WE TOK ANOTHER APTIC  FWE DID WITH HOURE FINGER WE THINK IT MY UM AFACIVE LIKE IT MYT NOT GO AS HI OR IT MY CHANGE THE VERYBALL IF WE USE OURE FINGER SO WE US A PYPSICAL STIC
2023,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOR EACH ANC TLICT FR SIX INCHES WE DID FOR TIMES AND THEND WE DOVIDED  BY FOURUS WE DIDN'T FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT A RESOLTS
2024,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,SO  LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FIP IF I OPIT IN THE PERSON WHOU DID IT I  ON OVER THER HEDS THEY WOULD POOT OVER THER HED AN  GO CLOSE TO THE TAKE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXTONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THE NEXT ON WAS ONE
2025,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,UH WERE TOCKING ABOUT T HOW HI THE THE MB GO'S UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVERE THERE THE IS A MEISER ING CAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP END DOWN THAT'S HOW THETHAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW  THAT SAR L GES
2026,BY FOUR,BY FOR
2027,TWENTY,TWONY
2028,THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT UH THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT,I OA<unk>IT GO THE NAND BALL BECAUSE HIERE AS I LIKE THE WERE WERE HAVING A MAUSJURING CAPE IN SOMETIMES IT GO HIERE THAN THE LIMIT
2029,YEAH YEAH EVERYBODY DOES FOUR TRIALS ON EACH CENTIMETER,YAH EATEVERYBODY HAS FOR TRILES ON EACH SCENE MEER
2030,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT,OH OH WE MOST OFTHE TIME WE MAKE HIT TO THE LIE THE SPORT ALTHEWAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT
2031,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND IN IN MORE AND MORE,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FARE THE STICK IS SO TO THE STICK IS TOTL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP POUSHING IT IN IN IN IND MORENMARE

2418,UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER,I'M NOT IVE AMEMBERG
2419,I KNOW THAT UM CIRCUITS IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF THE LIGHT IN ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF,I KNOW THT UM SURKAT IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIKE HOPS IN OR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL SURGE BECAUSE WHEN WE TUN LIEO ALL THE OTHER LIFE DON'T TUN OF
2420,WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF,MYSURKTS IS A SURN TYIP SURKET THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIT O PLAY POPESAND STOF
2421,OK BYE,OKAY BYE
2422,I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF,I THINK HAOW ALL IS THE ONE  IF YOU TAKE ONE AFTER THE OTHER ONE UN OF
2423,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON UNTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SA THE LFT FLAYE PALP AND THE THE RIYTE WONE WOULD GO OUTWHIN TURN BACK ON TW YOU POLL ON THE LAFT
2424,I THINK IT COULD BE BOTH ACTUALLY,I THINK IT COULD BE<unk>ACTALY
2425,THIS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO,ES ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
2426,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BY TO OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT,KD I THINK IT'S PRDY MUCH THE SAME ATSE AS THE ONE ONE MY THE LY BALLS ARE UM CLOSE TO EACH OTHERE AND THE WYERS AR THE SAME BUT THERE SHAPES DIFRENT
2427,YES,YES
2428,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE  THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE PATRS ADD FOR THE LIKE HYFBL BUT WITH THES ON IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SORSE TO GET THRO TWO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE ND IT CAN'T GO
2429,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL ST,IN OURE HOUSE IT'S NOT PAL BECAUSE THE PARE LS ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OF WHEN YOU TOURN OF AL THE OTHER AN'S TUNOF AN THE OTHER WANT'S TE ONE WERE YOUNE OF THE OTHER A
2430,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT,UM YES AND NO THE WYERS LOOK THE SAME UM THE PETRA LOOKS ALITLE DIFFRENT AND LIKEPOBSLOOK DIFFRENT
2431,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE,I SEE THAT ONEYPE PEAR OF LYPE HOBS IS BRITERE THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFRENT SEURKETS I BULLEVE
2432,GOOD,CAD
2433,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK,UM I THINK IF WHY WASN'T THERE IF THERE'S ONLY THA LITL NOTCH AT THE THOPE THAT FLYAND EVEN WORK
2434,NOT YET,NOT YA
2435,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WE IF YOU TURN OF A LIKE BALLS ALL THE OTHER ONSOUNOF BECAUSE THIT'S NOT TWO OTHER WYERS TATCHING THE BATERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TATCHING THE LIGHTE PALPES AND WANT TWO TATCHING THE UM BATERY
2436,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO FLOW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE,THIS ONE  IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATH WAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOR WHAYERS BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH WAY TO THRO FROME HERE TO THE OTHERO
2437,MABE I'M NOT REALLY SURE,NAV <unk> OTLISH ER
2438,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TOCKING BUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO YES I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WARE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT TOLAY POPE   ONE WITH STLL BE GOING ON
2439,THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON,IR I'S MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF SERKAT I THINK THEREIS ABOUT TWO SERKETS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OF ONE MYFPE PHOBE THAND THE OTHER ONE GOS OUT IN THE OTHER A WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OF A LIYPE PHOBE WHEN THE OTHERANI STOL GOS ON
2440,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF,I'VE BEEN WARKING ON PEARILELS SERKATS AN ONE OTHER SERKENT WHICH I CAN REMEMBER THE NAME OF
2441,UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH,UM EOU ON THS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE STL A PATHWAY FOR THE ANEAJYDATH FLOW THROO
2442,WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH,WELL ON THE WYER IS I WA LIKE A PATH WAY A HI WAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THO O AND OF THE WAYER WASN'T EATHY ENERGY WHEN GO THO
2443,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THING'S THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB,UM I THINK IT TALLS ME THAT THE E THINGS THO LIKE THE UM<unk>IN THE MIDL TE THINGS THAT ARE SEROUNDINGET ORE THE WAIERS IN H TWO ND THINGS WITHTHELITL LINSTCH ORE THE YOULIKEB
2444,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE,I THINK THAT THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ANYAS MANY BENS IND TWISTS UM IN THE WATER  ECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARLE FOR THE EDNEAGJY TO GET TFOOD THAN JUST A STREET UM  CAVE WATER
2445,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS THE SAME UM AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY,I THINK THAT THIS E IS M THE SAME AS THE OTHER OE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIR BUT WHAT I ME BY MORE THEN ONE WRIS THERE'S MORE THEN ONE WAYURE TUCHING THE BATR
2446,YES,YES
2447,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THO LYA SINCS IT'S TUCHING THE BA MUST BE COMING THROO THE LYBAL BACK INTO THE BARDER W BY THE LIKEBO
2448,YES,YES
2449,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KINDA THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP,WL THE LECTUR CITY HASE TO FLOW INASEU PLACE TO GO BAC UP TO THE BAO AND GO T THE CIND OF THING THAT LOKS LIKE A SPRING THANI MAKES ARIF THAY LIKE TU O GO AND ON
2450,YEP,<unk>
2451,WELL WHAT YOU DO WOULD YOU WRAP IT A KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THEN ANOTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOULD TURN ON,WWELL WHAT YOU DO WHIT YOU RAPED CIND OF MAKE A SURCLE AROUND THE UMBARR AND THEND YOU POT ON THE FOUTSIDE AND HUTCH WITH POTH THE WYERS YOU TACH ONE ONE IN AN ANNOTHER MEO PAG I WICH YOU TURN OT
2452,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE OF THE NOTCHES OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY,THE THE LACTA IS ACTUALY FLOWING THROO THE BA TO THE LIKE BALL AND THE  IS FLOING THO ON OF THE NOTES OR SOMETHING BAK IND TO THE BAR
2453,A CIRCUIT,I SERKENT
2454,WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY,WEL I DON'T THINK YIT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TACHING MONYD OF THE BA<unk>
2455,I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WAS IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T PUT IT ON THE UM BUTTON BUT UM IT IT WE IT'S GOING THROUGH A CERTAIN PARTS UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING IT GLOW COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING AROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN,I SEE IT'S UM AL IIIT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T Y ON BM IIIT'S GOING THO INSERTN PARTS UP TO A LITL WAYER COMING OP INTO THE GLAS SPOART MAKEING A GLOE  COMING BACK DOWN IAND GOING ROUND IN END OP AGAIN
2456,UM A HIGHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB,UM A HI WAY FOR THE ALECTRISITY TO COME THRO TO THELGE POPE
2457,YES,YES
2458,THE BATTERY,Y
2459,THE WIRE HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE,THE WIER HAS TOBE A PLACE
2460,UM ACTUALLY NO I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT AREA WHERE THE NOTCHES ARE,UM ACTUUALLY KNOW  SHE'S TOKING BOUT THE  WHERE THE NATCERES ARE
2461,WELL HERE NO BECAUSE THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULB IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME,L HERE NOW BECAUSE THE WHY ISN'T CATCHING THE OTHER SIDE OFE THE AR BUT THE LIKE HOBBIEST BURT IT SEEAMES TO BE ON WHICH I 'S CONFUSING ME
2462,UM NO,UM NO
2463,WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAID,OH IT SAMS LIKE IT'S ACTHUALY GOING FROM THE MINER SYDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT A MY TEACHERS SID
2464,THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR WOULD SORT OF BE LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN,WIERS ARE SORT OF CIND OF LE IF YOU ARE DRHAVING A COLARGE SORT OF FEL LIKE A HI WAY TO GET UP INTO THE Y LKE POBE AND BAK DOWN AGAIN
2465,YES IT'S A CIRCUIT,YES IT'S ASERKET
2466,UM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT,UM WELL YOULD HAVE TO MAKE SHURE THAT I WAS ON THE TWO POINTS PRERFICTLY OTHER WISE IT WIDNTERON IT WAS IN THE BIE PLACE TAT CHURCON AND STAY ON FOR A LITL BET
2467,GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE UM THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND DES,GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MUNEEISSIDE ILK HOBE BACK DOWN TO THE PLASSIDE AND
2468,AT THE UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM,AT UM WALL YOU CAN'T PRED ON THE GLAS BH FOR ITHERE DOWN FROM THE GLAS IF CHOUD BE ALITL ALSO REALLY THING WHERE IT WEL GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS IT PUT ONE OFE THE WAIYERS ON AR AND AND TA LEROUNDE THING ON THE BOTAM
2469,IT FLIPS IT AROUND,IT FLIPS IT AROUND
2470,BYE,
2471,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND,ALL ITS OF <unk>ASURCLE OF THE WIER COMING FROM ONESIDE OF THE BATL TO THE OTHER AND
2472,IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM DANGIT I JUST FOR,IN CONNEXT<unk>WAYIERS SURKETS UM THGDJUST
2473,GOOD,CAT
2474,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KINDA THING AND YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO,YOU HAVE OPUT ON THE ARL THING CIND OF RIDE UNER THE UMLIGE THE GLASA AND IM UND THAT IT'S THE LETL KIND OF THING CAN YOUL HAVE TO TUCH WANE OF THE WYERS THERE TWO
2475,THEY ARE I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THOUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE V FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH,TTHAT IS SAPOSE TO P IT COMINTOR WAND FIT WASN'T THER IT WOULD BE FEARLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTUY COMETO G
2476,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUATHING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITHTE ANING ON THE LEYBALL WE ONY WORK WITH THE WYR IT IS AND JUST ALBALLWITH THE WSON<unk>
2477,INTO THE LIGHT BULB,AND BY HOBBE
2478,E PLACE WHERE,PLACE WHERE
2479,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WE WER US IN WATER AND A LIKE POE AND A AWE COULD L O V UMWYPE POP
2480,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,BECAUSE FROM THE SSIRDE THRO THE YBALL LETSTART'S GOING AND O WHEN IT'S GLOING MORE LUCTRHEOAN IT GO TO THE MOINESIDE BILT' OP IN AL THE L GON FROM THE LASSIDE AND ETHE LYE BAL ANDTHRALOT ORE JUST THE BOTLY W WILL BERE NOW
2481,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT,WH THERE'S THE LITLE THING WHERE YOU<unk>
2482,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,IT TRAVOLES FROM THE LUSY <unk>THRO THEBAB HOSTHE MINESIDE AND GETTO INTO THE MAN<unk> MINEDE ANTL THE BATER IS BOUND OUT
2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOUHAVE A MIXTTURE OF WATER AND MARBLLES AND YOU POU AND YOU HAVE A BALL AND  SCREEN ON HOP THE WATER WLL GO THRO THES SGREEN BUT THE MARBLLES ARE TWO BIG TO SO THEY WIL STAY ON THE THOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPPURATE SOME TIPES OF MIXTTURE
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL THE DIFFRENT PARTS OF THE TRYALMMICS ARE SEPPERATING IN TO THER ON PIL AND EACH PI ONLY HAS IT'S LAE SHAPE AND TECTURA
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN WE MAKE TWO DIFFRENT THINGS TO GEATHER MU AND WATER FOR INSTENCES IN MPORT THEORE THIS THE FTURE HAS  VERY IMPORTNT ROL BECAUSE WHAL THE WATER DRAINDS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE THOPT AND THEN THEY ARE SEPPORATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,UM IT BEGAN DO DIFRENT CINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN WE MIXT IT TOGATHER E SOLS UM THE SOLL LAKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MEXT URE AND IT 'S NOW DESSALVE INDTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PYLES ON THE RY ARE ALL THE DIFFRIENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HANS U ALL ALLA DIFRENT CINDS MIXT TOGEATHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SKREEN IS VERY IMPORNT BECAUSE W WATER CAN GO THRO THE SREEN AND STAY IN THE BALL THE MARBALES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON THOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,IS COLD WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,UH GIRL
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHATS HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFRENT PARTS OF THE MIXTTURE ARE SEPPRATING IN TE THER ONLYUNI PIL THIS IS IMPOR IMPORNT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THERE ALL IN HE UNIFE PIL INSTEDOF IN ONE ALL TOGETHERE IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S SALUTION
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLD FULTURE AND IT UM IT'S PERPES IS TO SEPPRATE DIFFRIENT KINDE OF MEXT EURES WHIYL ONE THING APTHOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND ITTASET THE BOTM IN THE CUP AND UH SO FARE IT'S A VERY DIFRNT KINDE OF MIXT EURES TO SEPPRAE LIKE DIFFRENT CINDES STUF AND AND YE
2494,SALT,SOLT
2495,THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THIS MIXTURE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS,THE SOLT WILL GET DESSALVE INTO THE WATER AND ITS PECXTUR IS IMPORTANT BECAUSETHERE IS
2496,SOLUTIONS,SALUTIONS
2497,UH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK,UH THE SALED HAS MANY DIFFRENT CINDS OF FOOTS AND VEGETABLLES IN IT AND THE MORBALLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFRENT COLOR THWERLD INSIDE AND UM I'T
2498,THEY'RE SEPARATING,THE SUPRADING
2499,THE SALT WILL WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,HE SLLWAS DESALVE INTO THE WATER
2500,GOOD BYE,GOODBYE
2501,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE PROPRIES OF SOT IS AIIS ABLE TO DESSALVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISH IT LIVES UM IT LIVE NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVERY WHEIRE IN THE WATER
2502,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN NSELUTIONS IS THAT MIXT YEURIS ONE ONE OR MORE  WANE MOTIBALL THINGS ARE MIXT TOGETHER ANERABAL TO BE SEPRATED AND A SAULLUTIONIS WEE OTIBALE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPPRATED
2503,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,ESALIED HAS MANY THINGS FIS IN TO IT ONE THE CATS HAS A BONCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPPER AND AND HIT'S A PIL LIKE JELLY BINGAND NORML BINGS THES ARE ALL MIXERES
2504,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,IS IS IMPORTNT BECAUSE WHEN WE MIX TWO THINGS TO GEATHER YOU UM WE CAN PULL IT THRO LIKE A COE CULTER INSF AD AND THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTUM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MOD OR SOMETHING WELL STAY IN THE COF FLTER AN WL GO DOWN
2505,THEY FLOAT,I LO
2506,THEY ARE ALL MIXTURES,THEY ARE AL MIX
2507,WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE IND DOING ALOT O EXPEREMENTS BU EXCHUSE INDSOLUTIONS
2508,THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP,THE WATER IS SINGKING TO THE BOTBAL THE UB AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON THOP
2509,IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE,IT'S CALD A MIXURE
2510,I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE,I THINK WE COOLD BECAUSE EVERY THING CAN BE ESEPPRATED FROM A SULUTION OR MIXTURE
2511,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,ALL THE DIFRINTE KINDS OF THINGS NEAUTUROLMICES SEPPRIG AND IT'S IMPORTNT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2512,EVAPORATION,VAPPRATION
2513,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONSONTRATION OFE VALLUSTION BUY ETHER ADING OR TAK ING AWAY MORE OF THE STEARTHANTS INSID ITE
2514,THEY'RE MORE DILUTED,THEY AR MORE TAD
2515,SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER,SOLLITIENS ARE TWO ORD MORE THANKS MIXT TOGETHER
2516,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT,THE DOCER COLORD SELLUITIONS HAVE MORE GREAPE STUF AND AND ONE WOULD LAST COLOR HAVE LAST GRAPES UF IN IT
2517,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY FULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE FANTASTIC,WE DID THIS IN CLAS AND IT MUST TAST VERY <unk>ANDYRE AND VERY VERY VERY LL IF IT IS WITH THE GREATE TASTTIG
2518,UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM,UH WE HAVE NG MIXTURES AND SULLUTIONS AND LERNING HAD TO SEPPERATE THEM
2519,WELL TODAY WE USED UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CAN'T,OLN TODAY WE USE UH WEATE IN OUREXPEREMENT WE ALSO USE TASTE AND WE ALSO YUSETHING FAG
2520,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UM PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE AND  HAS LITL TINY BLUE DOG THINGS AND IT AND SO DIS THE ONE WITH LES UM OR IN PIRPLE  THAN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PIRPLETHHAS MORE BIG KOBS OF PIRPLE THE OTHER ONE HAS LES BIG KBS OF PURPLE
2521,THE SOLVENT,THE SAVENT
2522,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POUDER AND IT WOULD TAST MORE SWEEAT AND SLITLY SAWUR CAMPARD TO ONE WITH ONLY A CUPPLE ORLES THANGS OF GRAPE
2523,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LESS IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX,EACH MIXUR HAS FIFTEE MMEDERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS AJ<unk>UR HAS FIVE SPOOUNDS FOLES OF GRAPE POUDER AND THE ONE WITH LAST IT'S ONLY ONE SPOOUND FULL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MACH
2524,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNI FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAN ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WON'T,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYSE MU FIRST YOU CAN TEL IT BY TAE SECKEND YOUCAN TEL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAULD ALSO TELL IT BY WAT BUT BA WANDS NOT THAT SMART O I WANT
2525,WEIGHT TASTE AND COLOR,WESTE TASTE AND COLOR
2526,ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS,ONE HAS MORE POUDER AN ONE HAS LES
2527,WE CAN ADD MORE WATER,WE CAN AD MORE WATER
2528,A MIXTURE,A MIXURE
2529,BYE MARNI IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO LATER,IT'S REALLY GOOD TOKING TO YOU TWOO LATER
2530,I'M GOOD,I'M I
2531,I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE STUFF,I CAN TEL BY LOOKING AT THE DCOLORD CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUF IN IT PURPLE STOF
2532,IT WOULD TASTE LESS FLAVORFUL AND GRAPE,IT WOULD TAST LEST FLAVERFOTFOLL AND GREATY
2533,IT IS MORE DILUTED,IT IS MORE DYLUTED
2534,I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRIEND ON CRUTCHES,I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRIEND AL<unk>
2535,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILOLEIDERS OF WATER TBUT ONEF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLLU AND ANOTHER HAVES TWENY GRAMS OF SOLU
2536,ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM,ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MEX IN THM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SALUTION IN THEM OR SALL WATER FUL IN D
2537,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A THINGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD UM YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POR THEM INTO A LITL THINK AND LET THEM A VAPRATE YOU COOUD UM YOUCAN PTHEM THRW A FULTURE IN SEE HO MUCH THAT IS LEFT ANJUST AT E  P
2538,ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS,ONE HAS MORE SALUD AND ONE HAS LES
2539,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE,I CAN TAL YOU THAT WIT THE SOLT OR WATER SALLUTION YOU DO NOT KNOW THETS TA DIFFRENCE BETWEEN AL THREE GLASES BU WITH THE GREAT AX ONE HAS ONE<unk>OE IS IN THE L AND ONE IT'S LAS PURPLE
2540,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY ONES YOU CAN'T SEE,NPUSCE AND SELLITIONS AND HARW T THALE TH MASTH OF THEMESPESHALY
2541,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SORRY WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR,WHEN YOU POOT THE ROCK IN WHEN YOU POT THE FATHER IN IT'S LITER AND IT'S HEVYER THEN THE NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU POT THE ROCK IN IT'S A HEVYER THAN THE FHATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OU THE FHATHER IS HAVYER AGAIN TO AIR
2542,YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,YOU CAN TEL SULLITION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFRENT
2543,UH ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,UH ONE IS MOST CONCUENTRATED TWOISLS CONCUNTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDL
2544,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER,THE FATHERAY IS TWO GREAMS AND THE ROCKWAYS NI GRAMS SO WHEN WE POT THEM ON ASKIL TOGEATHER THE FATHER IS LIER AND THE ROCK IS HEVYER
2545,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUD AND AND ONE HAS LA SOLUGE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENY FAVMIL LEATERS OF WATER BU WIT'S THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY AMORE
2546,YOU COULD TELL HOW CONCENTRATED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER,YOU CAN TAL HOW COMERE THE TN T THEY ARE E THE COLOR THEM THE TAST F THEM ORE HOW MUCH THEY WAY IN THE GRAP DRINK MA THE ONE THAT HAS LAST POUNDER IS THE ONE LIER AND THE ONE EAT HAS MORE POUDER IN T TIRKER
2547,BYE MARNI IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE BYE,BYE BURNIN IT WAS REALLY GOOD TAOKING TO YOU TWO BYE BYE
2548,YES,YES
2549,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2550,BY DOING GRAM ADDING,I DO IT H GREAND HAL
2551,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT MY PRDUICTION WAS CORACT THE ONE WITH TWENY GRAMPS OF SU WITH A BET MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
2552,I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED,I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONTENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS LEST CONTENTRATED
2553,ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,ONE IS EST CONCOENTRATED TWO  IS THE MOST CONCUNTRATED AND THREE IS IN THEL
2554,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS,I THINK THE ONE WITH TUNY GRAMPS OF SLUT WILL BAY MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SO EATHE WONE HA
2555,TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS AGAIN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS THAT'S WHAT THIS PICTURE SHOWS I'M DONE,IN GRAMS PO TWENY GREAMS PO TWEN GREANT AGAIN ICOUL FIFTY GRAMS THAT'S WHAT THE PICTURE SHOWESEAND THA
2556,THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT,THENS FOR ME I HAD A LOT FOR WITH YOU TWOW I CAN'T WATE TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A<unk>
2557,A MIXTURE,A MIXTURE
2558,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES,I THINK THESS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPPRAT YOU HAVE TO LET IT A VAPPRATE FOR A LONG PERIETD OF TIME AN TUL THE O IS SEPPERATED AD LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER AT VAPRATES
2559,THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A MIXTURE,RS DESLVE IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTENT BECAUSE THAT TIME YOU MAKE A MIXTURE
2560,THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS THAT THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED INTO,THE WATER IS THETHING THAT THE ISN'T THE THING IND SPING JU<unk>
2561,A SOLVENT HELLO WHAT,I SEVEN'T HELLO WHET
2562,THE MASS IS INCREASING,THE MAS IS INCHREACING
2563,I THINK IT'S A SOLUTION,I THINK IT' SALLUTTION
2564,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS,THEREI' MANY WAYS YOU CULD DO THAT YOU COULD LE THE THING A THAPRA YOU COUD YOU COULD TAKE YOUR PART WITH A SCHREEN YOU COULD USE AYOU CAUDJUS SEES YOUR HANDS
2565,A MIXTURE,A MIXTURE
2566,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER,IT'S <unk>GREANS OF SOLT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTNT MORNING BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPPERAT SOLT FORM A WATER
2567,I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER,I THINK THE SALT IL RELT IN THE WATER
2568,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTALS,HERE ONEMEO<unk> I'M GESPING THAT ISOLT IS MIXT WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TO GEATHER IT UM IT WHAT HAPPENS IS IT'S WITH NOTHING BUT FU<unk>
2569,SOLUTION,SALIUTION
2570,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS,I KNOW THIS THAT WHEN IMNT THANKS TO GETHER AND WYE LIVE THIENLAYS AND THE WATER DISAPEARS
2571,HERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT,HERE THE SOLL CAN BE DESALVE IN THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE S I
2572,IT IS EVAPORATING,IT IS A VAPERATER
2573,YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND,YOU CAN U A VASPRA YOU CAN PICK IT OU BY HAND
2574,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT,TWO THANKS TOGETHER IT WILL CHRYAT A DIFREN'T WEY
2575,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTERSE AND SELLUTION
2576,HERE THE FLOUR IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ONTO THE BOTTOM AND AND THE REST OF THE FLOUR STAYS ON THE TOP IN THE COFFEE FILTER,HERE THE FLOWER IS BEEING ADED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER UMTHE WATER GETS SPORT DOUN URE THE WATER GOS THRO ITH AND ON TO THE BATUM AND THE AND THE RST OF THE FLOWER STAYS IN THE THOP IN THE COPI PALTER
2577,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,WHAT APPONING PIXTURE MORN IS WHEN YOU AD WATER TWO SOLTS OR SOL O WATER CREEAT SO WATER MIXURE AND THE WATER WITH FIFTY GRANTS THE SLL WAIS FIFTEEN GRANS AND A TO GEATHER EACUSE SIXTY FIVE
2578,A MIXTURE,I MIXXO
2579,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,THE WATERYSE FIFTY GRAMS IN SOLTD WAYSE FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN WE ADHETE GETHER IT CRATES A MIX YER AND IT WAYS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
2580,GOOD,GIRL
2581,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTIONS,WHAT'S HAP<unk>HERE IS A DIFFRENT THINGS ARE MIXT WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTION
2582,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEAN YUSE SKAIL FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET UH SOME GRAM COBS AND YOU POT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CHREEAT UM A WAY THAN IS EACWLE OR ABOUT EACWL AND WHEN YOU POUT ANOTHER THING ADED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED A MORE GRAM COUBES TO EACWL THAT
2583,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE,I THINK WITH ALL THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPPORAT THEM BECAUSE YOU CANTPIHAND FELTO DOSN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO  IS LET A VAPERATE
2584,THAT WATER PLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION,WATER S DIFENT MATERILES MAE ASELLUTION
2585,SURE MARNEY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS,STHERMANY SO WHA PIBA TODAY ITS ABOUT MIXTURESE AND SULLUTIONS WE CHOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURE AND SELUTIONS TOCK ABOUT HOW MUCH THE WY AND WHAT HAPPENDS WHEN THEY ARE MIXT TO HE GATHER WE ALSO TOCKT ABOUT IN MY OPINNION TBAST OF ALL WWHEN YOU TAKE SOL AND WATER  ITTOGEATHER THAND YOU LET THE WATER A THAT RAY AND YOU ONLY LEFT ITHSLE CHRISTLES
2586,THE SALT,TE SOLT
2587,THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE,THE SOL IS SOLVEN AND WHEN IT' SPORT IN THE WATER IT CREEAT'S A MIXTURE
2588,ONE KIND OF GRAMS PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS GRAM TOGETHER,ONE CAND OF GR ONE CIND OF GRAM EACUALE GRANMT TAOTHER
2589,THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE,THAT MEEDS IT IS A MIXTURE
2590,YOU COULD LET IT EVAPORATE,YOU CAN LET A VAPERADE
2591,NO,NO
2592,TIME,TIME
2593,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE AND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL,IS IS CALLD AVAPPORATION MARE WHEN YOU X SOLT AND WATER TOGEATHER THE NEW<unk>INTO A THING AND YOU LEVE IT THERE FOR WHIL THE WATER WILL AD VAPRA INTO THE AR AND THE WAT IN ESOLLT CHRIESTLES WILL UM WILL STAY IN AR IN YOU CAN SEPPRATE THEM WANT INT FOR ROME
2594,I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION,ITOTERTSSUBJECA ITHING PORT INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU POOL IT THO THE FILPERE AND THEN WANT TO  YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL OIT GOWS DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BASKET BELLOW THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFY CULTERE THIS IS CALD A SVELLUSTION
2595,THE SAND AND IN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE THE SAND STAYS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YOU IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT,THE SAND<unk>IN THE SANDIUND WATER MKXT SUR THE SANDTAPE IN THE BM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SELT AND WATER EXPERAMENT IDH IT DDALVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT
2596,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE,ALL THES DIFFREN'T THAINGS ETHER WAY TEN GRAMS OR TWENY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXT TOGEATHER THEY CHREEAP FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXT TO GATHER ALL THE DIFRENT FRIENDS THANGS ARE MIXT TOGATHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THER ONPIL
2597,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT,THA WHEN YOU MIKE TWO THAINKS TOGETHER THEY CRIAT A BIGER MATHS OR WATE
2598,I KNOW THAT NOTICE THAT SALT IS BEING MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP WITH THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER,I NOW THEAT NO IS THA SALT STMMX WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POOU A COFY FLTER AND THE WATER GOS DOWN INTO THE BOTRUM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SOLTS I INSTED OF STAYING AT THE THOP OFTHE COFY FULTUR ITCAUSE DOWN WITH THE WATER
2599,OKAY,OKAY
2600,UM CAUSE I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE,UM CAU I THINK <unk>EASAR
2601,WELL IT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILLIMETERS CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOOR TO SOMETHING OR HOLD IT AND THEN MEASURE UP TO YOU COULD DO THAT AND STUFF,IT'S YOU COOLD UMA<unk>AND CHEESE AND UM JUST MASER FROM THE FLOUR SOMETHING OR OLAND MASJER OP TO YOU COUD DO THAT AND STUF
2602,HOLD THE TAPE MEASURE LIKE I SAID AND THEN MAKE THEM LEAVE OFF LIKE I SAID UM AND THEN MEASURE UP FROM THERE,E WHAT'S IMPORTN MY NE IS THAT UM YOU SHOULD REALLY PAY ATENTION WATCH YOUR DOING AND YOU SHIRT UH
2603,UM YOU WOULD BEGIN AT ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND THEN END AT THE OTHER SIDE,UM YOU WOULD BEGAIN A ONESIDEOF THE TABLE AD VAN AND AT THE OTHERSIDE
2604,IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO HEIGHT UM N SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE BY TO YOUR HEIGHT REALLY BY TO YOUR HEIGHT YEAH,IT'S VERY VERY SIMMALAR TH I UM  SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NO USUALLY IT WILL NORMALY BE CLOSCE TO YOUR HI REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR HI YE
2605,WAIST TO KNEE AND STUFF,WITH AND STOF
2606,UM INCHES CENTIMETERS AND MILLIMETERS,EATHAM ANG CHEESE CENMED IS AND NEOMEATERS
2607,IT'S EASIER TO MEASURE,IT'S EASYEAR TO MEASGER
2608,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BEGIN ANYWHERE YOU REALLY WOULDN'T MEASURE,M BECAUSE VIDN'T PK UN ANY WARE YO REALLY WONT MAJER
2609,HI HI MARNEY,HI I'M ANE
2610,MARNIE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT,MON I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
2611,UM MY ARM SPAN MY ANKLE MY UPPER ARM MY NECK AND STU WHAT'S UP WITH THAT,UM MY AMSPAN MY O MY UPRARN MY NACK AND<unk>
2612,THEY ARE THE SAME SIZE,THYRE A THE SAME TIMES
2613,IF YOU WANTED TO MEASURE HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SOMETHING IS YOU COULD USE YOUR PINKIE TO COUNT IT OUT WHAT'S UP WITH THAT,IF YOU WANTED TO MASJER HOW MANY SENDD ORS SOMETHINGIS YOU COULD DO YOUR PINK KI THE KOUNTIDOU<unk>
2614,YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS WITHOUT A PARTNER,YOU WOUL NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN DO THESTHE PARTNER
2615,I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT,I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
2616,ONE END OF THE TABLE AND THEN END AT THE OTHER BUT I SHOULD HOLD MY PLACE SO I DON'T FORGET WHERE I WAS,IT CHOSE ME IC SHIRT BIG AND UH UM
2617,YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE LIKE UM YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE A ME METERS BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE THAN SMALLER THINGS I THINK,YOU WOULD PROBBLY USE LIKE EAUM YOU WOULD PROBLY USE O MEAT MEATER BECAUSE THERE EASYEAR TO USE TAND SMALLER THINGSTH
2618,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2619,YOU COULD LIKE UM,YOU COULDLLIKE UM
2620,UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS,UMRB ASIRT THE
2621,UM WHAT'S THE UM YOU SHOULD GO F YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TAPE MEASURE GO TO THEIR FEET AND THEN GO UP AND MAKE THEM HOLD THEIR FINGER WHERE YOU LEFT OFF AND THEN TAKE IT OFF AND THEN UM PUT IT ON AGAIN LIKE PUT IT SO IT GOES UP AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT IS,UM WHAT'S UM YOU SHOUD GO YOU SHOUD TAKE THE TEA MAJER GO TO THER FEET INDN'T GO UP AND MAKE THEUM HOLD THER FINGER WHERE YOUE LEFT OF ANDON'T TAKE IT OF AGAIN UM POO IT ON AGAIN IK OIT SOL IT GO'S UP AND THAN YOU CAN SEE WHERE IS
2622,YOU CAN FILL THE CUP WITH WATER SINCE THE SYRINGES FILL UP TO FIFTY UM EVERY TIME YOU TAKE YOU TAKE FIFTY MILLILITERS,ATH<unk>
2623,TO SEE LIKE HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,YS
2624,YOU USE UM A GRADUATED CYLINDER TO MEASURE THE WATER LEVELS,MS
2625,IT HAS MARKS ON IT THAT SAY TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY AND NINETY AND A HUNDRED MILLILITERS,SPORTTAK
2626,A LITER IS ANOTHER THING OF MEASUREMENTS,S
2627,MILLILITERS IS A SMALL LITTLE THING AND IT TAKES A THOUSAND MILLILITERS TO FILL ONE LITER,S
2628,UM MILLIMETERS ARE SMALLER THAN LITERS AND,EATH
2629,WHEN THE THING'S REALLY BIG LIKE OR ELSE TAKE A LONG TIME TO FILL,PIZA IKH
2630,CHANGED BY WE WOULD PLACE UM A LITTLE MARKER IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS TO SEE UM HOW STRONG THE FLOW STILL IS WITH IT BLOCKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD,CHANGE MY WAVORID PLACE M ALITL MARKHERT AND THE TWEEN THE TWO MAGNIETES TO SEE UM HOUSE TRONG THE LOWESTL IS WITH IT BLUCKING AND MAGNEATIC FEEOLD
2631,WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED STICKERS AND WE PUT EM ON A GRAPH TO SHOW UM HOW MANY SPACERS THAT WE COULD USE BEFORE THE MAGNETIC FIELD BROKE,WHAT WE DID  WE USTIC AND WE POOT O MONAGRAF TO SHOW UM HOW MANY  SPACERSE THAT WE COULD O I BEFORE THE MAGNATIC FEELD BROK
2632,WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAPHING THE INFORMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AS THE MORE SPACERS THAT YOU PUT AND HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL GET,IT IT'S IMPORTNT ABOUT GRASPING THE INFORMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AN THE MORE SPACUS THA HOW STRONG THE MAGHNMATIC FEYLE WUL G
2633,WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD UM TWO MAGNETS ONE WAS IN A PLASTIC CUP THE OTHER WAS ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE AND WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY WASHERS WE COULD FIT INTO ANOTHER CUP,WHA WE DID WAS WE HAD ON TWOM<unk> OESINASTIC THE OTHER WAS ATATCH TO THE BOTM OF THE SKL AND WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY WATCHERS WE CULD FIT INTO ANOTHER COBE
2634,UM FOR THIS EXPERIMENT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE STANDARDS,FOR THES IXPERMET <unk>T SHOURE WHAT'S IMPORTNT ABOUT THE STANDERDS
2635,YOU'RE WELCOME,
2636,MMM THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT CAUSE THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU ADDED THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAD SO THE LESS WASHERS YOU CAN FIT INTO THE CUP,THERE IS A LOTL BITTHE MORE SPACES THA YOU ADED THE LES IMMAGHNATIC FOR THELEST WATCHES YOU CANDFI IN TE THE COP
2637,YES IT WAS,YES IT  WAS
2638,DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FIELD WOULD FLOW THROUGH TO KEEP IT HELD SO THAT THE BALANCE WOULDN'T BREAK,IDSCUVER THAT THE MORE SPACES THA YOULD POOLT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNITS THE WLES OM MAGNATIC FEULD WOLD FLOW THRO TO CEEP IT HEALP HAN THE BOLENCE WOUDNT BRAKE
2639,YES THEY DID,ES THAY DIDN'T
2640,WHAT WE FOUND WAS UM THE INFORMATION ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS,WHAT WE FOUND WAS SOM TINFORMATION ON HOW STRONGMAGNMATICFL THIS
2641,TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU PUT UM S THINGS OR IN THIS CASE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE LESS MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAS,ELS ME THAT WHEN YOU POOUT O THINGS URE IN THE SKACE SPACERS IND BEWEIN THE MAGNITS THE LES MAGHNMATIC FHORSE IT HAS
2642,WELL I FOUND OUT THAT UM WITH THE REGULAR MAGNET YOU CAN FIT TWENTY ONE WASHERS INTO THE OTHER CUP BEFORE BREAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD,I FOUND OUT THAT UM WITH THE REGULAR MAGYOU CALD FIT TWENTY ONE WATCHERS INTO THE OTHER COUP BEFORE BRAKING THE MAGNETIC FEELD
2643,UM NO NOT ALL OF US DID BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY COMPARE THE RESULTS THAT EACH GROUP GOT,NO NOT ALLVUDD BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY COMPARE THE RESOLTS EATCH R
2644,YES,YES
2645,THE MAGNETIC FORCE BREAKS,THE MAGNETIC FORS BRAKES
2646,GOOD,GOOD
2647,UM YES WE DID WE HAD A SCALE WITH A BAG OF WASHERS AND ALSO FIVE SPACERS TO USE AND OF COURSE THE MAGNETS,M YES WE DID WE HAD A SKAYL WITH A BIG OF WATHERS AND ALSO FIVE SPACERS IS AND OF COURSE THE MAGNMETS
2648,WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS RECENTLY WE WERE EXPERIMENTING WHAT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND WHAT DOESN'T,WHA WE HAVE BEN'T DOING IS REENTLY WE WE EXPERMENTING WHAT CANDOCT ELECTRISCITY AND WHAT DOUS
2649,A CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE WIRES THAT GO AROUND THAT COMPLETES THE ELECTRIC FLOW SO THAT IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE,SURKL IS WHEN YOU HAVE WAITERS THAT GO ROUND THE COMPEATELECTICTHAT'S GOING IN A SURCLE
2650,RKING AND THEN WHEN YOU BY THE SWITCH IT WILL ALLOW THE UM ELECTRI,KING AND THEN WHEN YOU CLOSE THES SWIPCH IT WILL ALOW THE UM ALLECTI
2651,WELL IT'S THE SAME AS THE LAST ONE ONLY THOUGH THEY'RE USING A MOTOR IN THIS ONE AND IT STILL HAS THE BA,WELL IT'S THE SAME AS THE LAST ONE ONLY THOW THERE YUSING O MOTER IN THIS ONE AND IT STILL HAS AT
2652,I THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME SORT OF PIECE OF METAL WOULD WORK LIKE A MAYBE A BLOCK OF GOLD OR IRON MIGHT WORK,I THINK THAT IT PLASE SOME SORT OF PECE OF METL WOULD WORK LIKE MAYB  BLOCK OF GOLD OR IAND MY WORK
2653,IT TURNS AROUND THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS FLOWING THROUGH ONLY THOUGH IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S STILL COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT TURNDS ROUND THE BATRY AND IT JUST KEPS FLOING THRO ONLY THO IT'S GOING THE OPPOESIT WAY BUT IT'S STIL COMING FROM THE NEGUITIVE SCIDE
2654,TO ME THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND IT HEATS UP CAUSE IT CAN'T GO THROUGH AS WELL SO IT LIGHTENS UP,TO MEAT THIS LOOKS LIKE APEARALLELSURK BUT I'M NOT WHIT SHURE BUT TO MAKE THE LYBALPTHE EALECTISITY FLOT O THE FILLMENT AND ITS OPCUSE IT CAN'T GO THRO AS WELL SO IT LITNDS OP
2655,WELL WHAT THAT DOES IS CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO MAKE WHATEVER YOU'RE USING WORK,WHAT THAT DOUS IS CANDOCT ELECTRUSITY TO MAKE WHATEVER ISING WORK
2656,THINK IT IS BECAUSE AND MOST ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IF IT DOESN'T FLOW FROM THE UM NEGATIVE SIDE IT MIGHT NOT WORK BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE ABOUT THAT,I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IN MOST ELLECTRICCAL CAORENTS IF IT DOUSN'T FLOW FROM THE ON NEGERTIVESIDE I MYE NOT WORK BUT I'M NOT EXSACLY SHURE ABOUT THAT
2657,SWITCH IS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT SO THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE CIRCUIT IS U,WHICH IS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT SO THAT WHEN THIE SWIP IS OPPEN THE SURCED IS O
2658,YES,YES
2659,NO,NO
2660,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL AND IT COMPLETES THE CIRCUITS SO THAT THE MOTOR WILL WORK,IT'S GOING ON IS THE PAPPER CIP IS MAD OF SOME SORT OF METEL AND COMPLEAT THE SERKIETS AT THE MODERBAL WORK
2661,O IF YOU WANTED TO COMPLETE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY YOU WOULD USE SOME SORT OF C,IF YOU WANTED TO COMPLEAT THELYOU DS SOME SORTOF
2662,WHAT IS UP WITH THEM IS THAT THEY AREN'T MADE OF ANY KIND OF IRON METAL OR STEEL SO THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WON'T FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,WHAT IT'S UP WITH THEMIS THAT THEY ON'T MATE OF ANY CIND OF IURN MEL OR STEL SO THE ALECTRIC CORINT WAN'T FLOW THRO IT TO MAKE THE MOTER WORK
2663,WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS SO THAT UM THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WILL FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,AT IS IMPORTANTIS SO THAT ON THE LECTURIY CORINT WILL FLOW THROW TO MAKE THE MOTER WORK
2664,FLOW THROUGH,LAST REA
2665,TTERY AND THE SWITCH,REE IN THE SWIT
2666,THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH JUST A BASIC ONE THAT GOES AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,THE SURCELT WOULD BE FOR THE MUCH  BACEIC WHEN THEY GLOSE AEROUND IN HE SURCOLE TO MAKE THE MOTER WIRK
2667,WELL THIS PICTURE IS HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD SHOW HOW A BATTERY AND THE WIRES GO TO A LIGHT BULB AND AND IT HAS A PICTURE OF A SWITCH AT THE BOTTOM BUT THAT'S NOT THE PICTURE THAT AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD USE,WL THIES PICTURE IS HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGUNNER WOULD SHOW HOW A BATERY AND THE WYIERS GO TO LAY BALL AND IN HE HAS A PICTUR OFSWIPCH AT THE BOTM BUT THAT'S NOT THE PICTURE THA IN AELECTRICAL ENGUNEAR<unk>
2668,YOU COULD ALSO CONNECT THE WIRES TO MAKE IT WORK,YOU COULD ALSO CONDECT THE WYIERS TO MAKE  IT WORK
2669,THE WAY TO GET IT TO WORK WOULD BE TO JUST TAKE THE LEVER AND MOVE IT OVER TO WHERE THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THAT PIECE OF METAL,THE WAY TO GET IT TWORK WOULD BE JUST TAKE THE LUVOR AND MOVE IT OVER TO WHERE THE WAYRS CONECTED TO THAT PECE OF MAT
2670,GOOD,GOOD
2671,UM ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF IRON WILL WORK OR ANY JUST PRETTY MUCH ANY KINDA STEEL OR METAL WILL WORK,UM ANYTHING THAT IS MAD OF IURN WILL WORK OR ANY S PERY UCH ANY CONE STIOL OR METL WILL WORK
2672,YES THAT IS THE CORRECT PICTURE,YES THAT IS A CURACT PICTURE
2673,YES I DO IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIAL THAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF WON'T ALLOW THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT TO FLOW,YES  I DO IT'S THAT'S UM THE METERIAL THAT THERE MADE OUT OF WON'T ALLOW THE ALECTRICCAL CORENT TO FLOW
2674,I THINK THAT MOSTLY ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL LIKE STEEL IRON GOLD GOLD IS THE ONE OF THE REALLY GOOD CONDUCTORS WILL WORK,I THINK THAT MOSTY ANYTHING THAT IS MAD OF SOME SORT OF METOW LIKE STIL IREN GOLD COLD IS THE ON OF THE REALLY GOOD CANDOCTERS FOR WORK
2675,WELL A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE A CIRCUIT SO THAT A LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR OR WHATEVER YOU'RE USING WILL WORK,WELL A CONDOCTER IS SOMETHING THAT WILL ELECTRISITY FLOW THRO IT TO MAKE A SURKET SO THAT LEYBALL OR MOTER OR WHAT EVERUSINGBRK
2676,WELL TO ME THEY S IT SURPRISED ME THAT THEY WOULD USE HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD DRAW UM HOW TO MAKE A MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB RUN,WA MEA THI IT' SEPRISE ME THAT THEY WOULD LUSE HOW AN ALECTICAL ENGINER WITH DROA UM HOW  MAKE A MORDER LIPE ALL RUN
2677,WELL IT WOULD GO FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GO THROUGH TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND KEEP FLOWING UNTIL IT COMES BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE ON THE D CELL BATTERY,WELL I WILL GO FROM THE NEAGUET OUSIDE AND GO THRO TO THE TWO LI BALLS AND KEEP FLOWING NTIL IT COMES BACK TO THE POASETIVDE ON THE TELL BATR

2916,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDES TOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE WIRES GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKE INTO,UH WINNEGOD SIYDE  I A WATER SKARING A NEGURTIVE SA IN OE WATER IS TACHING TEASITIVWHICH IS MAKE IN ALECTOING THREO THEI MAKE I THE
2917,AH UMM,UM
2918,IT WOULD BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY WILL,A REALLY BE IT WOULD NBE A SURKIT H AND LET TUR<unk>
2919,ELECTRICITY BECAUSE ELECTRICITY IS A BLUE DOTS FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE WHILE THROUGH THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHEN THE WIRE ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S THE UNTIL LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHERS,LIKE TUISCIY BECAUSE LE TSEE BLUE ACTH GING THROW THE DSEL AND UH ON OF THE WATCHES ON THE POITS AND ANE THE WATRES AR OND THE NEGURTIVE SIDE AND AT T YBALL BACK TO THE OTHERS
2920,JUST IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS ACTUALLY STAYING LIKE ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS A NOT REALLY AND KEEPS GOING OFF AND YOU HAVE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE BULB AND STUFF LIKE,IT'S DIFRENT BECAUSE UH THAT WONIS AXTST ENGLI ONN AND THAT WHEN IS IK NOT REALLY I HIPS GOING OF IAC REALLY LIKE BALL AN<unk>
2921,AH WELL RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAD THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE,UM W FRIT NOW THE PICTURE HAS THE WAYERE 'S BOTH TACHING THE SIDE AND THE EGORSIDE OUR TATCHING BOTH OF THE BOTH THE NEGULORS UR TUCHING ACHUTHER WHEN THE PASTIVESACHING THE NEGURTIVESIDE IT WIRKS BECAUSE THERE'S A WATERE ON THE NEGUDTIVE SAT AND PSTR
2922,ONE D CELL AND IT'S NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL,UH N ONE<unk>H SNO THE LEBHOBS ARE NOT GLOING Y GOOD AND  TWO UM BUT THE TWO LIKE THE LE BHOBS ARE GLOING BRITER THANA
2923,IT WON'T GLOW,I WON'T
2924,THE CIRCUITS ABOUT A FALSE CIRCUIT,IT SERKET'S ABOUT

2929,WHAT PICTURE,WHAT PICCERE
2930,WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAVE THAT WHAT,WHENE THE NEGURIVE SIDE ON THE NEGURIVE SIDE IS ANLY THE POSIVESIDE ORE WAN I HAVE THE WAT
2931,IF WIRES BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE WHICH SHOULD MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,IT FLOSE BECAUSE T ONE OF THE WACHEER OND THE POSETSIDE ONE THE WAHEON<unk>I I MAKE IN IT A CAOMPLEAT SEURKET

2935,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN REPIAT THA
2936,HI MORNIE,BYE AN
2937,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THERE IS NOTHING THERE IS NO WIRE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE IS ONLY WIRE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE'S TO MUCH SUCTEG  THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NOW WHYE IT'S CING THE POSITIVESIDE THERE'S ONLY WAYE SUCHING HE NEGURTIVE
2938,THERE ARE LIKE BULBS ARE GLOW,THE E HOBS ARE G
2939,THEY LONG GLOW POSSIBLY,THEY WON'T GLOW POSIBLY
2940,IT REFLECTED BY IT WILL GET MAY BE IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND MORE D CELL TO YOU GET FIT IN THIS,I I FECT IT BY IT WILL GET MAY BE IL GET BRIDER ANBRIDER THND MORE DETALS  YOU GET FIT IN THE

2958,YOU SEE COLOR,IUE COLOR
2959,AT FIRST THE LIGHT WAS OFF BUT WHEN THE GUY TURNED IT ON IT UM LIKE AT FIRST IT WAS DARK AND YOU COULDN'T REALLY SEE THAT MUCH COLOR BUT THEN WHEN HE TURNED IT ON YOU COULD SEE A LOT OF THE COLOR,AT FIRST IT WAS OF WHEN THE KY TURNDUM AT FIRST I WAS AND YOU COUDN'T REALLY SEE THAT MUCH COLOR THEN WHEN Y<unk>YOU CUD SEE A LOT OF THE COLOR
2960,THE GUY THE GUY SEES HIMSELF IN COLOR BECAUSE THE LIGHT BEHIND HIM IS,THE KIE THE GI IS SOFN COLOR BECAUSE THY LIKTHE BA HIND THE
2961,THE LIGHT IS BEING REFLECTED UM TOO MANY TIMES FOR THE LIGHT TO TRAVEL AND THE LIGHT IS LOSING SOME MOST OF IT'S ENERGY AND THEN BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE STAR THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MORE,JELY ITS BEEING REFACTED UM TWO MANY TIMES FOR THE L TO TRAVOL AND THE LIGTE IS LUSING SOME MOSTOEDERGY AND BY THE TIME I GETS THE STAR UH THERE 'S NO THERE'S NO MORE
2962,REFLECTING LIGHT OFF OF THE MIRROR IT'S WE USE TO REFLECT TO REFLECT LIGHT OFF OF IT AND THEN AND THEN TO MAKE A REFLECTION ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING,RERFLACTING LAT OF OF THE MAR IT'S BEING  IS REFLECT T REFLACT LITE OF  AND AND MAKE REFLECTIONA L ON ASIDE THE BUILDIN
2963,BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS ENTERING THE EYE AND UM AND WE'RE SEEING AND THE GUY SEES COLORS AND IT MOSTLY IN THE LIGHT AND THE IN THE,BECAUSE THE LITE IS ENTERING HEEY AND UHUM ININGAND I SEE T'S COLORS TY IN THE LIKE AND UH IN THE WHITE
2964,COAL ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE WIND TURBINE AND THE SOLAR CELL THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE FOSSIL FUELS AND YOU CAN'T RENEW THEM VERY EASILY,S ANDE COLE ARE DIFRENT FROM THE WINTER BINE AND THE SOR SO THEYRE DIFERENT BECAUSE OF THAT THERE NO THERE PASTLE FELDE AND YOU CANT RENEW THEM VERY EASALY

2970,A NONRENEWABLE ENERGY YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONCE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE COAL AND THE GASOLINE YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONCE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE COAL AND THE GASOLINE YOU CAN ONLY USE THOSE ONCE BECAUSE THEY'RE A ONE TIME USE AND THEN ALSO UM THAT YOU'D HAVE TO GET MORE UM YOU'D HAVE TO GET MORE TO TO USE IT,NONEWL ANERGY YOU CAN ONLY YOUSE A WONCE LIKE FOR INSTENC THE CL AND THE GASILINE YOUCAN ONLY JYUSE THOSE ONCS UM BECAUSE THERE A ONE TIME IS AND THE NSTLE UM THAN YOUD HAVE TO GET MORE UM YOUD HAVE TO GET MORE TO TO UI
2971,WE HAVE BEEN EXPLORING CIRCUIT,WE HAVE ENE EXPORING SURKET
2972,SOME CAN BE RENEWABLE SOME ARE FOSSIL FUELS WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T BE RENEWABLE VERY EASILY,SOME CAN BE RENEWBALL SOMMER FUSO HN THAT THEY CAN'T BE NEW BALLAS
2973,WE USED MOST OF IT UP SO NOW WE HAVE TO GO INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEAS LIKE THE AND THE AND THE DEAD SEA TO ACTUALLY A MORE FOSSIL FUELS LIKE UH GAS LIKE GASOLINE AND,WE USE MOST O IT OP SO NOW WE HAVE TO GO INTO THE MIDL OF SEAS LIKE THE MEDEITARIN IN THE GREAT AND H DEDCEA TO ACTULY KA A MORE FASTLE FOLES LIKE GASLIKE GASILINE AND
2974,HEAT,IT
2975,WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR,WHY YEAR
2976,BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING UP THE MOUNTAIN AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME,BECAUSE SHE 'S WHOCKING OF THE MOUEN ANDINGAT
2977,BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED TO KEEP US WARM AND OTHER THINGS WARM BUT THEN YET AGAIN WE CAN ALSO DO A LOT OF OTHER STUFF WITH IT LIKE MAKE A CAR RUN OR LIKE KEEP OUR BODIES RUNNING,BECAUSE WE IT CAN BE US TO KEEP US WIARM AND OTHER THINGS WAM BUT THEN YET AGAIN WE CAN ALSO DO A LOTOF OTHERSOF WITH IT LIKE MAKE A CAR RUN OR LIKE CEEP OUR BODYS RUNNING
2978,BYE,
2979,BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND THEN DISTRIBUTE IT INTO,BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLECT ENERGY AND ENDERS TRIBEAUTED  IN TO
2980,BECAUSE IT HAS OXYGEN TO KEEP RUNNING SO THAT YOU CAN DO SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT TO GIVE ENERGY TO YOURSELF AND CREATE HEAT,BECAUSE ITH HAVE OXUGUN TO CEP RUNNING SO THAT YOU CAN DO SO THAT YOU CAN YUSE IT TO GIVE ENERGY TO YOURSELF AND CHREAT HIT
2981,I SEE WOOD A GAS CAN APPLES AND A,I SEE WHOUT IN APPLES AND  KA

2988,THE WICK AND THE WAX,THE WEEK IN THE WAXE
2989,ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF UM BECAUSE IF YOU BURN COAL AND GAS THEY BOTH COLLECT THEY BOTH US REALLY,DIFERENT BECAUSE UH UM BECAUSE IF YOU BIRN COL AND YES THEY BOTH COLLECT SMALL THEY BOTH UH REALLY
2990,YEAH YEAH WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE BURNING CANDLE IS THAT IT CAN BURN YOU AND ALSO THAT IT IS GETTING OFF ENERGY RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ALL AROUND IT YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT YEAH,UH YH WAT I'S IMPORTNT ABOUT THE BARNING CANDL IS THAT IT COUD BARN YOU AND ALSO HA IT IS SKIPING OF HEDNERGJY NOW AND IT'S ALL AROUND IT YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT YEH
2991,THEY BOTH TAKE THAT THEY BOTH TAKE RENEWABLE SOURCES THINGS FUELS AND THEN THEY CONDUCT THOSE AND THEY MAKE THOSE INTO INTO UM INTO ELECTRICITY,BOTH TAKE THAT THEY BOTH TAKE RENEWBLL DSOUR SORSESE THINGS AND THEND THEY CANDUCT THOSE AND THEY MAKE THOSE ININTO UM INTO ALLECTRICII
2992,UM THAT THEY WOULD PRODUCE SMOG WHICH IS BAD FOR US AND THAT IF WE BREATHE IT IN WE WE HAVE WE HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF GETTING UH CANCER OR HAVING TO HAVE,ON THETTA WOULD PREDOUS SMALL UH WHICH ITS BAD FOR US AND THAT IF WE BREEATHE IIN WE WE WE HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF GETING KANCERE OR HAVEING TOHAVE SE

3001,IT'S GONNA STAY DARKER,IT'S CAN STAY<unk>
3002,BLUE BALL REFLECTS BLUE LIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE BECAUSE IT ABSORBS EVERY OTHER COLOR IN THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR BLUE LIGHT AND IT REFLECTS BLUE LIGHT AS WITH THE SAME AS THE YELLOW BALL EXCEPT YELLOW BALL REFLECTS UM ABSORBS EVERY COLOR IN THE RAINBOW EXCEPT,BLUBALL REFLEX BLUELI BECAUSE THAT'S UH BECAUSE IT OBSORBS EVERY OTHER COLOR IN THE RAINBAL EXSEP FOR BLUE LH EPLEXAS WITH THE SAME AS THE YELLOWBALL EXSEPT YELWBAL REFLEXE UHUM OBSORBES EVERY COLOR IN THE RAINBAL EXSEP FR

3006,BECAUSE IT IT REFLECTS GREEN,BECAUSE IT IT X GREEN
3007,IT SHOULD GIVE OFF WHITE LIGHT,IT SHOULD GIVE OF<unk>
3008,THAT WHEN YOU TURN ON A FLASHLIGHT IN IT UM THE LIGHT IT COMES OUT WHITE AND IT DOESN'T COME OUT ANY COLORS MORE BUT WHEN YOU PUT A PRISM IN FRONT OF THE LIGHT UM A THREE UM A THREE DIMENSIONAL UM TRIANGULAR UM TRIANGULAR PRISM IN FRONT OF THE LIGHT THEN IT SPLITS THE LIGHT INTO ALL IT'S INDIVIDUAL COLORS,TH WHEN TUNON  FLUSHLIHE IN IT UM THE LITE IT COMES OUT WHITE AN IT DUSN'T COME OUT ANY COLORS MORE BUT WHEN DOYOU POUT A PRISEN IN FRINT OF THE LACKE UM UH THREE U A THREE DOMMENCIONAL UM TRENGULAR UM TRENGULAR PRIESOM IN FRUNT OF THE LACKE THAN IT'S PLITS THE LIKE INDO ALL IT'S INDEVIGJUAL COLO
3009,THEY ALL GIVE OFF A UM WHITE AURA AROUND AROUND THE LIGHT SOURCE,THEY ALL GIVE OF UM WHY ORRUN RUND THE
3010,LIGHT RAY HITTING THE BALL IT HITS A WHITE SPOT AND THAT CERTAIN WHITE SPOT IT ABSORBS THE COLOR THE WHITE LIGHT AND ALL THE COLORS IN THE WHITE LIGHT WHILE ADDS WHILE ADDS THE BLUE PARTS OF THE BALL THAT ARE FACING THE LIGHT WHEN THE LIGHT RAYS HIT THAT THAT PART OF THE THE BLUE PARTS OF THE BALL IT UH THEY BOUNCE OFF AND THEN THEY BECOME AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY BOUNCE OFF THEY BECOME BLUE BLUE LIGHT,URLY HITDING THE BALL IT IT'S A WHITE SPUT AND H SIRN WHITE BUT IT UBSORBES THE COLE THE WHIT AND ALL THE COLORS IN THE AND WHILLE AS THE WHALL IT'S THE BLUE PARTS OF THE BALL THAT ARE FZINGLY WOD WHEN THE LER IS HIT THAT THAT PART OFTTHE BLUE PARTS OF THE BALL THAY BOUND OF AND THEND THIY BECOME AN H ASSO AS THEY BONDS OF THEY BECOME BLUE BLUEE
3011,WE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE COLORS OF THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT SPECTRUM,WEVE BEN LERNING ABOUT THE COLORS OF THE LACKE OF THE LAE SPECT
3012,IT BECOMES A RAINBOW BECAUSE THE PRISM DIVIDES THE WHITE LIGHT INTO ALL THE COLORS RAIN,IT BECOMES E REINBOL BECAUSE THE PRISEN DEVIDES THE WIA IN THE ALL THE COLORS OF THEB
3013,I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON THE UM IT THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE PRISM AND THE AND THE PRISM UH CREATE UM AND THE PRISM UH DIVIDES THE COLORS IN THE IN THE LIGHT SPECTRUM,I NOTE THAT WHEN THE LATER ON THID CHINPE THRO THE PRISENMENT IN TE PRISENE  AN THE PRISEEN UH DEVIDE THE COLORS IN IN THE IN THE LIKE SPECTIOL
3014,IT UM IT RELATES TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE RED SHEET OF PLASTIC IT UM IT DIVIDES THE LIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T DIVIDE THE LIGHT INTO THE INTO THE RAINBOW IT DIVIDES LIGHT INTO A RED LIGHT,IT UM IT REALLATES TNTOCKINGBAL BECAUSE  THE RED UHSH FLASIC IT UM IT DEVIDES THE LIGTE BUT IT DOUSN'T DVIE THE LITE IN THE INTE THE RAINBALL IT DE VIDES LIGHE INTO A RED
3015,UM IF A BLUE OBJECT IS PLACED BEHIND THE FILTER THE IT APPEARS LIKE A DARKER A DARKER COLOR BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT A PIECE OF PAPER THEN IT UM THEM IT IT APPEARS RED,UM IF A BLUE OBJECTS PLAYPIHER IT PEARS LIKE A DARK A DARKER COLOR BUT THEN WHEN YOU POOT A PIZ A PAPPER THEN IT UM THEN IT IT APEARS RED
3016,I SEE THAT WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES FULLY THROUGH THE PRISM IT BECOMES A,I SEE THAT WHEN THE LIGHE SHINES FOLLY THROW THE PRISOM IT BECAUMES A RA

3049,YEAH,YEA
3050,THEN UM THE WIRES WOULDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING,UM THE WATERS WOULT REALLY DO ANYTHING
3051,JUST ONE JUST TWO PATHWAYS ARE OUT OF THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER TWO ARE CONNECTED TO THOSE TWO WIRES,JUST ONE JUST TWO PATHWAYSE ORE AT THE BATR AND THAND THE OTHER TWO ARE CONECTED TO THOSE TWO WYERS
3052,YES THE SI THE SIDES OF THE BULB BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT TO BOTH SIDES,YES HE<unk>ESIDE OF THE BALL BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT O BOTH SIDES
3053,YOU JUST ATTACH IT TO THE BATTERY AND THEN ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB GOES ON,UDJUST ATTACH IT TO THE BATERY AND THEN ATTATCH ITTO THEEBALL AND TH
3054,WHAT,WHE
3055,THEY'RE ALL MOVING IN ONE DIRECTION THEY GO UP AND CURVE TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN COME BACK AND GO TO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO BACK TO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO TO THE BATTERY AGAIN,ALL MOVE IN ONE DERECTION THEY GO UP IN CURFTBAL APBALL AND THEN COME BACK AND GO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO BACK TO THE OTHER  AND AND GO TO THE BATRY AGAIN
3056,IT MAKES THE WIRES COME FROM THE BATTERY FROM THE RIGHT END AND THEN GO RIGHT UP AND THEN MAKE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS STAY UP THERE,MAKES THE WAIERS COME FROME THE BATRY FROME THE WIDIN INS THEN GO RISE UP AND ND MAKE THE TWO VYPEALS STAY OP THERE

3066,GOOD,GIRL
3067,IT'S TWO CORDS AT EACH END OF THE BATTERY AND THEN TWO OF THE CORDS ARE GOING TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER TWO CORDS ARE GOING TO THE OTHER,TWO CORDS ARE EACH AND THE BATR AND THEN TWO OTHE CORDS ARE GOING TO ONE LACPEBALL AND AND THE OTHER TWO CORDS ARE GOING TO THEOTHER
3068,THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH,O YOU LIKE TREZLING FLOING THROW

3073,IT'S FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULBS,THLYBTS
3074,IF THERE IS MORE BATTERIES THEN THERE IS MORE LIGHT BULBS BUT THERE'S JUST ONE BATTERY SO IT'S IT'S DARKER,IF THERE'S MORE BATRES AND THERE'S MORE LI BOBS BUT THERE'S JUST ONE BATRIT'S STARK
3075,THE BATTERY IS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE WIRES ARE IN THE SQUARE SHAPE AND THEN THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ON THE SIDES,HS IN THE METDLE AND THEN THE WAYERS ARE IN THE SKWEARE SHAPE AND THE THALS AR ON THE SIDE
3076,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
3077,I WOULD CALL IT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,OOUR COL APEAROLE E SRGA
3078,UM YOU JUST PUT IT TO THE BATTERY AND CLICK THE LITTLE THING AND THEN YOU DRAG THE OTHER END TO THE LIGHT BULB,TTO THE BATR AND CICK THE LITLE THING ANDTHAN YOU DRAG THE OTHER END TO THE LYB
3079,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY WE GET A BATTERY AND THEN WIRES AND THEN WE MAKE A LIGHT BULB OR MOTOR GO,TRING ALECTIITY WE GET AFH AND THEN WYERS IND AND WE MAKE A LYPE BHOB OR MOER GO

3668,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF,I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE OND WAX FEAPOR IT MAKES DON'T CIND OF
3669,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ASORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO N IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH,IT IS C BECAUSE SO SOLPE UP AHEWATER SO IT DOUSN'T TAKE OP IT'S MUCH ROOME WHEN WI PROGROM WATER AND ON THE SOPY WATER IT HAS SOPE AN SOPE IS IN SORBP SOPE CTAKES OUT AND SO THE SOPE MAKES IT SO IT A TAKES OP MORE ROOM AND THAN IIT DOSN'T GOOT TIT HU
3670,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,ON SOM OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT SKET'S HIR UNSOME OF THE WATERS IT GET'S LOWER SOTHAT'S
3671,IT GETS BIGGER,H GIT'S BIGER
3672,THE BATTERY IT IT UM WELL IT HAS ELECTRICITY INSIDE OF IT,THE OR UH UM WHAT HASE ALECTRISIY INSIDEOI
3673,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OH WHAT WAS I GONNA CALL IT UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET,UMBRK ALL THE TIME SO PHOBBY OHUCD UMWH I WORK ALLTHE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBLY JUST A MAGNIT BUT THIT'S ONE PROBOBBLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGHNET
3674,AND YEAH THAT WHAT I THINK THAT THEY DO WITH THEM MMM HMM,AND YEAH ES I THINK WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM
3675,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED AND WITH THE MAGNETS FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL,ECAUSE WE  WE LEIRND WHITH THE MAGNITES THAT SOMETHING TO PICK ET OP HASTB IURN HASNT HAVE IURN IN THAT EO
3676,MMM HMM THEN ALSO YOU COULD USE IT AT A JUNKYARD TO MOVE STUFF AROUND,THEN LSE YOU COULD GIT IN A JUMKARD TO MOVE STUF AROUND
3677,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACES THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT'D BE PRETTY BAD,IFOR FOR KARING PLAY THANKS FOR LONG DSTNCES WOULD RUN OREALLY BAD
3678,YEP MMM HMM,YEPNS
3679,UM YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND MORE MORE TIMES,UM YOU COULD RAPPEDLY RUN MORE MORE TIMES
3680,YEAH WHICH IS AT THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET MMM HMM,YEAH CH IS AT THE HAD OF THE N
3681,UM WELL WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THAT PART MY GROUP SO,UM WLL WHE DIDN'TRALLY GET THAT PARTO MARGHREUT SO
3682,NOPE NOPE UM,NO NO UM
3683,YUP,E
3684,THE WIRE BASICALLY SO YEAH,WIERCSO YES
3685,THE ELECTROMAGNET HAS ELECTRICITY,THE LECTOUREA MAGNIT HAS A LECTTRISCITY
3686,AND OH WHAT WAS ALL THE ELSE WHAT WAS IT A UM,AN'T HO<unk>EWAS OME
3687,PROBABLY HAS IRON IN IT,POOE IURN AN
3688,UM CAUSE IT WOULD JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY LIKE GET LESS AND LESS AND LESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES MMM HMM,UM BECAUSE IT' JUST  ENEARGY I GET LES AND MYAND I' FINALY JUST ICE
3689,UM THEY SAID THAT,I V'T KNO UMLAD<unk>
3690,UM WELL WE HAD MORE THIN WIRE THAN THICK WIRE SO SO BASICALLY THE THINNER WIRE WORKED BETTER,UI'M YHD MORTHIN MORE THANI THE WIR SO IT'S PLEASE ANWARBETER
3691,UM OH LETS SEE THE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE HAVE NO CLUE YEAH ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS,UH UOH WHAT'S MORE TILY DID I THINK THE MORE HAVE NOW YEAH ENERGY OR THE MORE POURFUL WAS
3692,YOU'RE WELCOME YUP,ME WELCOME F
3693,PROBABLY YOU CAN WELL PROBABLY YOU CAN ACTIVATE IT EASY MORE EASILY YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF,UCAN <unk>EANDCTV IS MUREAN<unk>ON AN OFH
3694,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE RE MAKEING A LOT  MAGETS BUT ALSO WE 'RE TRING DIFFRENT THINGS WITH ELCTRYO MAGMETS AND SO AT'S F WE ABACE CLEASAMING
3695,NOPE,NO
3696,NOT REALLY NOPE,NOT REALLY NO
3697,WELL ELECTROMAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP SINCE THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM,LIKETMAGS JUST METL AND THIS WOR RUO WHSUBSINCE THEY WER BUT THERE'S SORT OF BRUC SORT OF OLL THAT'S WHAT I
3698,IRON,I AM
3699,YEP,
3700,TO TEST THE MORE WRAPS OH YEAH LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN WRAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN WRAPS MY GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN AND THEN FOR FIFTY WRAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS MMM HMM,S THE MORE RABS OH YAH LAST WE WE HAD TEN RABS AND WE HAD A CHAY THER SO FOR TEN RABS MY GRUP THEN I'M GOT EYERL BUT FOR TWONY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN TEN FOR FIFTY RABS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WATERS
3701,AND,ENS
3702,AS I SAID I THINK IT'S UM AS A BY IT'S CLOSER TO THE THE RIVET,I THINK IT'S UM AT'S CLOSKE IT'S CLOSER TO THEUH<unk>
3703,WHAT UM,EM
3704,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNET YOU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MMM HMM UH HUH,UH WLL YOU COULD HERE YOU SOMETHING THEN DRAP IT OVER THERE BUT WHITH A YOU JUST CEARY ARY N OU COUDN'T DRAP IT HAFE TO POOL IT OF WHITC WOULD BE U WRK WOUD'S LIKE A CALR  UH
3705,THE TO THE RIVET N AND WOULD,THA TO THE RIVER IB
3706,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETISM WELL THE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IT CAN AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET,SO I THINK I US SPEAK CLOSTERE TO THE HED OF THE MAGN  WHATCH IS THE BIGER POITUMCAS I DOSN'T HAVE TO TRAVOL AS FOR IN THE MAGHNITK CU E LERN AT THE BIGG  MAGNETAL THE MAGNNTUMASTHE T TRAVOLSE THE MAGNETISUM D SPEEAKER AND WEEKE AND WEEKER SO  BE MORE POURIFUL IF HE POULT  BY THE HED OF THE MAGNET
3707,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP WELL PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM,IT'S I THINK IT'SUMW EY USUALLY VISIT UH DOMPSTEARS TO PIC CUPBALL PLACES GARA CHIPS TO PICK UP COLURS AND THINGS IND MOVE THEM
3708,THEN WHAT ELSE COULD YOU USE IT UM,THENUM
3709,UM WELL,M
3710,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S ALL WELL IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICIS AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAG WELL I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT YEAH,THE RIVER IT'S UM IT'S E LO PORT SOMETING THAT CAN KARY LCT AND SO TIT PICKS OP THEIT'WATCH IT UH SO YEAH
3711,WORKS BETTER MMM HMM,WEERKS BETERN
3712,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVE IT MORE ENERGY ES CAUSE IT'S CLOSER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT'D BE UH HUH,UM I THINK THAT I GIVES IT MORE ENERGY S BECAUSE IT'S CLOSER AS N'T HAVETO TRAVOL ALLTHE WAY THRO THE WATER IT'S RITE THERE SOME THE MORE RAPPINGS THE MORE POURFOL THE E LECTICO MAGN WOULD BE AND THE CLOSTER TO THE HAD B MORE
3713,THEY HAVE THE METAL INSIDE OF THEM THAT TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY I THINK AND THEN THE RIVET ACTS AS A,THEY HAVE THE MEDOLE INS SA M THRANS PORT THE LECTRISITY I THINK AN THEN THE RIVE ACT AS UH
3714,I LIKE PICKING UP THINGS,<unk>THINGS
3715,NO MMM HMM,NO M
3716,WELL WHAT HAPPENED,WL WHAT HAPEND
3717,YEP MMM HMM,N
3718,NOPE JUST PICK UP LITTLE METAL THINGS,NO JUST BECAUSE <unk>THANKS
3719,FOR IT TO WORK MMM HMM,FOR IT TO WIRK
3720,PROBABLY MIGHT USE IT WELL YOU COULD USE IT FOR CLEANING ROOMS THAT WOULD BE PRETTY HANDY,HOLLY MY  IS UH  TO JUS IT FOR CLAINING ROMS HAVEPRY DY
3721,MMM HMM AND THAT MAGNET WAS JUST PICKING IT UP WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY OR BATTERIES OR WIRES,WAS JUST POOCKING UP WITHOUT ANY LIKCE TRISTIVY OR BATRES OR WAYERS
3722,NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN JUST UH HUH,NOTHING WHALD HAPEND UST
3723,MAYBE THE WIRES MAKE IT UM MAGNETISM SO MAKE IT LIKE A MAGNET SO IT CAN PICK UP THOSE WASHERS,MABIES UH WAIERS MAKE UM MAGHICTISOM SO MAKE IT LIKE A MAGNE SO CAN PICK OP THES WASHERS
3724,UM I HAVE NO CLUE,
3725,UH HUH YEP,<unk>
3726,YEAH BEFORE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PICK ANYTHING UP,YEAH BUT FOR WIN MY FIRSTSTORY MAKEILOMAGT WE AR RAPBING IT AT THE END AND I WOULDN'TANYTHING UP
3727,WE TRIED TO SEE DID IT MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE H HOW DOES IT DO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE,WE TRIYED TO SEE H MATER HOW TCK THE WAIER WAS AND HOW TIE  THE HOW TTHE MATER HOW TYE THE OYLES
3728,WE PICKED UP MORE WASHERS MMM HMM,<unk>MORE WATCHERS M
3729,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY MMM HMM,EAWE HAVE THE RIVER AND THAT'S TE THING THAT PICS UP THE WATHERS WICH WERE E COURK AND M AND THEN WE HAVE THE WATERS WHICH TRANCS PORT THE INLECTLECTRISITY AND THEN YOUHAVE THE BATRY M
3730,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD'VE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAG UM WELL A ELECTRICITY SO UM,THENI WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD HAVE EATHER EVEN MORE ROBIR OR ICOUD AVE BEEN MORE WAYER TO CARY MORE MY UMELECTICITY SO UM
3731,GOT STRONGER UH HUH,STRONGER H
3732,POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL,S THE E
3733,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,I HAVE TO ATCH ONESIDE OF IT AND WANTATE LYPEAP TO MAKE IAT LITE OP
3734,THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THERE IS ONE BATER WHAIERS AND A LYPEBOL
3735,POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE,IVE IN NEGEDIVE EAT
3736,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP,THE L BOB IS NOTINOF ALECTRISITY BECAUSE THERE NOW WYRS ATATCH TO THE TWO ENDS SORE I'S NOT RIDING OP
3737,THE CAN THE CON WHAT'S THAT,DOG CAN THE<unk>
3738,YES,ES
3739,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A M NOT MAG A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT UP,WELL WEVE IN MORNING ABOU HOW TO WAIERS ON AM <unk>I AM BATR IN ENTRYDOMIC COLYPBE BHOB H MY HOP
3740,UM SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS,SO THAT THE LECTRISITY WHEN I LIKE F YOU TAKE E IND OF THE NEGITDIVE AND POOT THE WHERE THE PASTIVE IS ON THE BOM ONFE THE LYOBALL ITL SOC YOUR FINGERS
3741,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE,OULD TATCH THE WYERS TO EATH SIDE ORE THAT THE PASETIVE IN EAGY GOWS OUT ONESIDE IN AN THA NEGUTIVE ANERGI COMES OU FROM THE BOBE AND GOS BACK IN TO EDSIDE
3742,WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL AND ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB,WYIERS ARE EABLE TO TAKE ENAGY FROM THE DSIL AND A TDATCTO THE VYPEBAB
3743,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCKED MY FINGER,I ATATCH TO WYIERS TO BOTH IN IN E ATATCHTO BOTH TO THE RIDER IS IN B THE FIRST TIME I TATCH BOTH THE BOTA REALLY SHOCK MY FINGER
3744,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,BAL AS YOU SAD THING ABOUT THE SURKEL IT'S RITE BECAUSE H THE SNG ARMS ARE ATATCH TO THE WIERS AND AT A CLOSCE SURKEY
3745,GOOD,WEN
3746,WHICH END IS ON THE POSITIVE AND WHICH END'S ON THE NEGATIVE,WHICHINS OM THE PASETIVE AND MUSCHINSE ON THE NEGATIVE

3751,THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF,THE BOB SHOS YOU F YOURE DOING IT RIDE WITH THE WAIERS IN THE BATRY BECASE IF YOU'RENOT DOING IT  IN MY SHOC YOURSELF
3752,THE GREEN AREAS BY OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE UM D CELL AND ON ONE SIDE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S THAT ONE UM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT'S SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND KNOW WHICH ONE WHICH SIDE SWITCHED,HE GREEN ARIEAS CLOSE OF THE EALLEPTISITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE MSEL AND ON ONE SIDE ON UA POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S UA ONE UM THING THAT STICS OUT AAT SO THAT YOU CAN ATATCH ONE MAE THE ONE E AND NOTHWHITCH SID WITCH
3753,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE UM,THE ALECTISITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGITIVE GING OP THRO THE CANDAUING ARMES IN COMING RIDBE BACKAE INTEL THE
3754,IT LETS THE WIRES GET ENERGY SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE LIGHT IT CAN UM LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES,UH WHECH THE WATERS K ENARGY SO THAT WANT ITD ATATCHES TO THE WHY IT CAN UM<unk>BECAUSE OF ALL THE POUR THAT'S GOING THOE THE WIERS
3755,THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WIRES IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE D CELL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE IT WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE,THERE ISN'T A PATH THRO THE EALECTRICI ALECTRISITY TO GO THRO OR THRO OR THE LIGBOB IS INT THERE FAU JUST A TATCH TOTO WHAILLERS IT WILL IT WILL NOT WARK THE THSL WILL RUN OUT OF INAGY BECAUSE NON OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABL TO ATATCH BACK TO THE UM POSETERSIDE  KEP GOING TO THE NEGUATIVE IF POSETERE SO THET IT BACK O PEACH SIDE
3756,IT IS RIGHT AND THE REST OF THEM ARE NOT,I IS RI IN THEREST OTHE MON
3757,WELL THE BATTERY'S A D CELL AND IT HAS POG POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE LIGHT BULB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIRE,WH THE BEATR IS A SOL N HAS PA<unk>POSETIVE AND NEGETTIVE AND H WHY BOB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIER
3758,THE CONDUCTING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM AND TO THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES IT LIGHTS UP,CANDOUCTING MS ARE ATATCH TO THE BOMENT THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU AT THATCH THE WIYERS I LITES OUP
3759,IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST CIRCUIT THOUGH THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL COMING BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT,IT'S THE SANETHING HA HAPPEND IN THE LAS<unk>THE THE ALECTRISITY IS STEL COMING BUT YOU CAN NOT SEE THAT
3760,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO UM THEY'RE TRYING TO UM GET ATTRACTED AND YOU CAN MOVE THE BOTTOM ONE THE TOP ONE WILL MOVE TOO,WELL THE TWO MANUNGS ARE TRING TO UM THERE TRIN TO UMGE ATTRACTIVE AND YOU CAN MOVE THE BOTOM AND THE TROPOANO MOVE TO
3761,AND ON THE THICK AND ON THE THICK PIECE OF ON THE THICK STACK IT IT CANNOT ATTACH TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GET TO THE TOP,AND O<unk><unk>IT IT CAN OT ATATCH TO THTHE MAG<unk>BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPPER AND THE MAGHNETICOR<unk> CAN I GET AT THE THOP
3762,THE MAGNET IN THE MAGNET IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE PAPERCLIP THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GO THROUGH ALL THE PIECES OF PAPER TO TRY TO GET THE TO TRY TO GET THE PAPERCLIP,THE MAGUTHE MAGM IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE PAPPERTHAT THE MAGHNATICCAN NOT GO THRO ALL THE PIEES OF PAPPER TO TRY O GET THE TO TRY TO GET THE PAPPER CLIF
3763,WHEN YOU DROPPED THE MAGNET AND IT WENT UNDER THE TABLE YOU MOVED THE TOP YOU MOVED THE BOTTOM MAGNET S AND IT AND IT MOVED THE TOP MAGNET AROUND THE TABLE,WHIEN YOU DRAP THE MAWENT UNDER THE TABLE YOU MOVE ONTHOP YOU MOVE THE BOTMAGTS AN  AND O MOVETHE CAANAROUND THE TABLE
3764,YES,YES
3765,THE THICK STACK IS TOO THICK FOR THE MAGNET TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERCLIP AND THE THIN STACK IS ABLE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT CAN GO THROUGH,HE<unk>STUCK IS TOO FIC FOR THE MAGNT TO BE ABLE TO PICK OP THE PAPPER CLIP ANDUK IS ABLEBECAUSE IT'SHA MAGHNEIC FHORSE IT CAN GO THROW
3766,LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM,LERNING ABOUT MAGNETISOM
3767,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS REPEL EACH BECAUSE ONE HAS UM ONE SIDE OF THE MAGNET THAT DOESN'T WANT TO STICK TO THE OTHER SO IT'S CALLED REPELLING,WEL THE TWO MAGNRELL EACHOTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS UM ONESIDE IS TA MAGUMET THAT IS'WAT STIC TO THEY OTHER SORT COLORE
3768,ONE S ONE UM STACK OF PAPER HAS IS TOO THICK SO THAT THE MAGNET FORCE CANNOT PICK UP CANNOT KEEP THE PAPERCLIP ON AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THIN SO THAT IT CAN KEEP THE PAPERCLIP ON,ONE ONE UM STOCK  PAPPER HAS IS TWO TFICK SO THAT THE MAGFORCANICANH CEEPS A PAPPER CLIP ON AND THE OTHER ON IS<unk>SO THAT CAN KEP THE PAPPER CLIPE ON
3769,THE TWO THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER THROUGH THE PLANK OF WOOD,THE TWO THE TWO MANTYTS ARE TRING TO GET TO GEATHER THRO THE FLAINK OF WATER

3779,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS,WIETH IN MRORNING ABOU CONDOCTTERES AND ANZLATERS
3780,BECAUSE A WIRE IS LIKE A CONDUCER BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON LIKE A NAIL OR PAPER CLIP SO THAT IT CAN CONDUCT ELECTRICITY,BECAUSE WHY IT'S LIKE THE GA CANI DO SO BECAUSE IT IT'S MADE OT OF ION I CA NELW OR PAPPER COBE SO VAT I CAN CANDUCT ELECTHURY
3781,WHEN THE STRAW IS TRYING TO DID WHAT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT'S STILL OPEN,WHEN THE STRA IS TRING TO DO BUT THE CONDOCTER DYS IT DOSN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLOSCE SURKE IT'S STIL OPPEN
3782,IRON,IAM
3783,WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK,WELL THE MATERLE THAT MIX THE CONDOCTUR A JUST MAD AD OT OF PLAYING METLE IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU POUT THE IURN IN IT WILL WRK
3784,IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH AND IT'S CLOSED AND YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR AND ATTACH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH THE SWITCH WILL START UM THE SWITCH WILL START WORKING AND THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB WILL GO ON,IF YOU HAVE A SWH IN IT CLOSCE P A CANDOUCTER AN ATATCH ITTO THE OTHERSIDE THE SWICH THE SWICH WIL STAR UM THE SWICH LSTARE WIRKING AND THE MOER OR TYPE BOB WILL GO ON
3785,GOOD,GID
3786,A NAIL CAN MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE L SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTOR S,<unk> COULD MAKE THE MOR<unk>YOU ATACH IT TO THE WAITER AND THEN TO THE SWICH IT WILL MAKE THE MOTER
3787,ALL THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METAL,HO CONDOCTERES ARE MAD FROM METOLE
3788,THEY'RE COVERED WITH PLASTIC,THEYRE COVORD WITH PLASTICS
3789,WHEN THE NAIL TOUCHES THE CONDUCTOR WELL WHEN THE NAIL IS THE CONDUCTOR AND IT TOUCHES THE SWITCH IN THE END OF THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND,WHEN THE NALE TUCHES THKNG DOCTER  THE NALLE CKING DOCTOR AND ITTUCHES UH SWIPH AND UH AND THE WATER MAKES THE MOTER SPING EAROUND
3790,THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS,THERE IS ONESAL AND TWO BALLS
3791,I THINK WE HAVE PARALLELS BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE IT ISN'T AS DIM AS WELL IT'S NOT AS DIM AS ONE CIRCUIT BUT IT'S AS IT'S LIGHTER THAN THAT CIRCUIT BUT IT'S THE SAME CIRCUIT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS,I THINK WE HAVE PERLELLS BECAUSE IN OR HOUSE ISN'T ASE DAM AS WELL IT'S NICE D ONE SURKE B IT S IT'S LATERE THE NATSUREKBUT THE SAM SURKET SO I'M NOT SR HOWE THAT WORKS
3792,I SEE ON THE LEFT THERE'S A NON PARALLEL AND I SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE IS,I SEE  THE WAT THERE IS AHEN I ERIDE THERE I
3793,YES,YES
3794,IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONES THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL,IT HAS TO LIKE BOS IN ONE BATERY THE OTHER ONTS WITPEDS HAVE TWO LIE BOBS ON ONEBATR BUT THERE NOT HEAR A LO
3795,GOES BACK IN THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,PACK IN THE TEL ON THE OSTEIVESIDE AND THEN IT COMES THRO THE POSETOUTSIDE AND GO'S BACK DOWN TO THE NEGUITIVE FROM A PIZTAL OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3796,WELL THAT THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB REPRESENTS THE TWO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IT'S IN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT UM AND HOW IT WORKS,WLL THAT H ARY REPPRESENTS THE TWO LINESE IND AND THE LIKEBALL PRISENT THT O THE WHIPE BALL BECAUSE IF YOU SCHROL OVER THERE I 'S IN ONE END IN AT THATCHES IKE IN THE UM SKHEMATIC DRI AND SO THAT THE YOU CA ACALY SEE UM AND HOW WORKS
3797,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS,A IF ITR PERALAL SURKE IT'S A LOT BRITER LIKE A HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PEARILALS SURKETS
3798,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN UM A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THROW F FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES,WLL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERY THING IN UM A HOUSE HA'S ALECTERISITY AND IT'S INTERESTING TO LERN ABOUT HOW LETTRISIY THROW FLO THRO MY HOUSE IN STOIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME A I OPEND  MY SURCALTE BOXE N MY DAD SHOD ME A PLACE IN A WALL WHERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING IN I GOT TO SEE AL THE WYERS

3810,I SEE,I SEE
3811,IT IS GOING THROUGH ONE END OF THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING BULBS UP AGAIN AND THEN GOING AND THEN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,IT IS GOING THO WINE AND OF THE<unk>RIDING OP THE BALL AND IN COMBING BACK THRO THE DISEL RHIDING BOBS OP AGAIN ANDI GO IN JUST REPEADING AL OVER AN OVER AN OVER AGAIN
3812,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE,L<unk>WAMING THRO THE NEGITIVE THRO THE LYPBE HOBS IN DOUN INTE THE POSTETAF
3813,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE D CELL FLOW THROUGH THROW THROUGH ONE HI ONE LIGHT BULB LIGHTED UP AND THEN COME BACK TO THE D CELL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND COME BACK TO THE D CELL,THE WIERS ARE WENING ONE WIER IS LETING THE <unk>FLO THRO THROW THRO ONE HONE YPEBA BIDED UP IN NCMEBAC<unk>THEN THE OTHER ENERGJY OF GO THRO P THE OTHER LYPE BHALB AND COME BACK TO THE
3814,I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I SEE A AROLEOWK
3815,HELLO MARNIE,HELIVE MARNI
3816,THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINED,THEY ARE JUST TWO L SURKETS COMFINDE
3817,HELLO,HELLO
3818,BYE,BYE
3819,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL COMING OUT OF THE OTHER END LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST GOING THROUGH A THIN A THIN WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB THEN GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL AND REPEATING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN,THAT IT IS GOING THRO THE SEL COMING ATHE OTHER AND LIDING OT THE LIYBALL WHATCH E ELECTRISITY IS ACTUALY JUST TORING THRO OUT A I WHIER AND ALEGYBALL THEN GOING BACK THO THE SEL AND REPEATING AT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3820,THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PATH NO TWO TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY,THE PEARALLL SURKETS HAVE ONLY ONE AT NO TWO TWO PASTH WAYS ETCH B BAOB HAS ONE PATH WAY
3821,THE D CELL IS LETTING ENERGY THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY,THESAIL ISIS FLEDING HIERGY THRO BOTH WATERS SO THAT IT LET BOTH FLEYBALL LYDE OP WITH THE SAME  MOUNT ENEURGY
3822,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT THAN THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS,THERE IS ONE PATH WAY FOR EATCH WHYPBALE SO THAT W<unk>MORE THAN OTHER SURKETS BECAUSE THEY SHLY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG SURKE WHY <unk> IT'S JUST TWO LITL SURKES
3823,M WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL CAUSE UM SINCE THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WIDTH ER THEY'RE ALL WIDER,UM THERE ARE THREE CMATERS BUT THEREEASNT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT  EMOUNTH IT'S CUSTERE WHITDER I THINK WELECAUSE UM SINSE AL THREMAERS TERE NOT ALLGO NO THTHY THE IN THE ALL DIFFERENT ANCERS I THINK THAT THERE ALL SERTNY THY THERE AL DIFR FU AND THY  LO  DIFFERENT WITH THEYE AL WHITER
3824,HI,
3825,WELL WIDENESS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE AND A CIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHER'S JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S WIDER HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FOURTH GRADE THAT IF YOU S IF THAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'LL FLOAT SO WITH THE BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH THE WIDER BOAT CUP BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOAT BETTER AND HOLD MORE PASSENGERS,UM  WHY ES IDEPSNI O HAVE UM SOM THING THAT'S  ONE FOT WHY AN SSURCLE ONE FOUT WHY AN HE OTHERE IS JUST  AN INCH I THIT TH ONE LL FLOWT BETER AND WILL HOLD MORE PASONGERS INC IT'S WI WHYDERN'T HAT'S MORE RM AN IT WL FLOWT BETER BECAUSE M WEL FOBETR BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE AM LERN IND FOURT REAT THAN  OUIF THAT THE BOUGS WALK ON WATER THEY SPRED THER WAY EVEN LY  THAT' A FLOW SO W WATS THA BIG BW IT'S WHAT THE WATER BW CUP ACHWALL OR BW THAT'S WAT L HAPPEN AND AL JUST FOT BETER N O ORE PASTONGERRS
3826,UM WAIT BOATS ARE,EM<unk>OTS
3827,L FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO SPREAD 'EM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK 'EM TO ALL ONE SIDE ELSE YOU WON'T GET THE ANSWER YOU NEED TO KIND OF SPREAD 'EM EVENLY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS UM MY PARTNER WE HAD THE SAME BOAT THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE HE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURED OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN 'EM OUT,UH FA YU NED  EVEN LY YOU CAN'T SCACKMALTO ONE KIR'S I WON'T GET THE RIE DANER YOED I IND OM SPED  EAVENLY OROUND ABOUT ECAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORK WITH PARTNERS UN MY PART WEYHATE THE SAME BAOLL T EE CY  ONE  SE THE SAME ONE HE GO DANCE OR NINE TENES BUT THEN I FIGRT I WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN ECAUSE HE DIDN' EVE N A MOUTH
3828,WELL I'D WELL I'D WELL FIRST I'D LIKE PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNIES IN THEN YOU WANT TO PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YEAH CAUSE YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK CAUSE IF IF EIGHT WITH EIGHT PENNIES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL UM IF THEY IF EIGHT PENNIES SINKS IT THEN THE RESULTS WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES,WHE I  WL FIRST I LIKE PUTTHE BOUTER CUP IN THE WATER ANDTHEN YOU WANT TO POULT PENNIS IN NHEN O WANT A'S MANY PENNIS  AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU YOU DON'T CAUNT THE WANT THAT MAKE IT SING AN NATS YOUR ANER LIKE YE ECAUSE YOUDON'T HAVE THE ANTE HAT MAKE IT SING ECAUSE IF IF IGHT WITH EIGHT PENIS IT SINGKS THEN THEN I WILL UM IVHT PENY SINS THAND E RET AUT WUILD BE SEVEN PENNIES
3829,IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE THAT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE,IT DAESN'T LOK LIKE THEET DIDN'T OK IK
3830,WELL UM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PENNIES LIKE ALL TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD KIND OF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU EVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST STAY EVEN AND AND AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER,WEWELL UM IF YOU LIKE BUTTHE PEE IS LIKE ALT ONE ONE SIDE A TAND A STARTE HIP BECAUSE THERE'S TWOO MUCH ON THE ONE PARTICCULAR SIDE B IT WOLT THIP TEDISIDE ST STAY EVENEN N AND UH TL O THE BETER
3831,UM I THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAT IT MIGHT SO THAT ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE,UM IWAL I THOT OF UM MANEY W LIE WHY THEY ARE WHI YOU GOT M I'S ON E THOS BIG CASF CUPS ANDJUST TO LITL THINGS IN THE SAMEHI CAN FEEL THEM ECAUSE ONEIS WITER AND THE OTHER CAN BE ASS WHYITDE SO  I MAYE SO THAT WONE MAY FLOW MORE
3832,UM WELL THERE ONE H ONE UM CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER S SIDE THERE'S T TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S STARTING TO TIP THAT WAY AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GONNA TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK,UM THERE ONE ONE  COP IT'S ALL SANURD SO IT'S EAVEN WE SPRED AT THE WY EVEN BUT ON TE OTHER SIDE THERE'S T TWO MANY ON THE RITE SIDES AI'SOING TO THIP THAT WAY AND IN F FEW MORES CAN I CIP COMPLEATLY AND IL ITS FILL WITH WATER AND SING
3833,YEAH IT DOESN'T LOOK,MO<unk>
3834,YO WHAT UP I'M READY TO LEARN,YOU O
3835,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HEIGHTS AND ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY WANNA TEST WHICH ONE WILL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATER,EH LOOKS LIKE THEYVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SCICES OF BLTS AND LOOKS LIKE IN  BELL HITE AN LOK LIKE I WANT A CASWHICH U ONEALALLE THE MOST PASUNGERS OR WHICH AL'STOE MOSTE WATER
3836,UM YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO ME I'M READY TO TALK,UM YOUCAN AK ME I'M REDY O TARK
3837,UM WELL,OAM T WELL
3838,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TESTING HERE,M A<unk> AS HERE
3839,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WHOEVER'S TRYING TO TEST IS SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECA SEEING UM IF A SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AND YEAH,UM Y LOOKS LIKE THE WHOE HEVER IS TRY TO TUST TO SEING IT THIT MAKES A DIFRENCE PE SEEING UM ITS TA SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGER ONE AND  YEATH
3840,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A LIKE A KIND OF WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT COULD FILL WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE'S A TON OF WAVES AND IT DID SEE IT TI IT SWIVELS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST STAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST STAY FLAT IF IT THE WATER'S CALM IT WORKS BETTER,WELL  GT WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERY WERE THE BOLK FILL WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AN IT COUD JUST HIP WAVES INDIT D'IT SWIM ROS FROM SIDE O SIDE BUTIF IT'S COM THEN IT L JUST SAY I WON'T REALLY MOVE THEM MUCH IT AL JUST  FLAT IF IT THE WATERS COMI WORK BETK
3841,UM WHEN WE MADE THE BOATS WELL WE WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW MANY PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH WATER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF THE WELL NO BUT UM IF LIKE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT,UM WHEN WIMMEAKE BOTH O WE WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOMY PENIS I CAN OLD HOVE HOW MUCH WATER R THEY WLL HOLD AND UM IF THE WELL NOW BUT UM THAK THE SYSE OF FC
3842,UM HOW H HARD,'M HOW HAR
3843,BYE,BYE
3844,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF THERE IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME JUST SEE IF IT'LL AFFECT IT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,THE VERY ABALLES O IKE  DIFRENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROL EXPEREMENTIS UM WEL FEW CHANGE THANKS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WITHES HAD MCHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF HIS A CONTROL EXPEREMENT A FEE WEKS BECAUSE YOU SL  CHANGE WANTING AT A TIME AN A FEOW CHANGE MORE THINGS ATA TIME TO SEE FEL AFECT THAN IT'S NOT A CONTROL EXPEREMENT
3845,UH LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH,UH LOOK LIKE THE TRINGTO THRY A TIMENY TIMES IT SWIMGS IN FIFTY ABOUT FIFTEEN SECENDS IT LOOKT LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE ORS IT WASN'T MUCH
3846,WELL WE HAD WE EVEN HAD A TWO HUNDRED,WERE WE ARE ILIVE TWO HUNDRID
3847,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT WELL RECORDING INFORMATION LIKE LET'S SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING A FORTY CENTIMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN ON THE GRAPH WE WE DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE LIKE A TOWER ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION,OM AGRAF IS ABOUT  REORDING O INFORMATIO IN LIKE SAY WE HAVD A THEIRTY CEN ETERS STRIN OF FORT CENE MEETERS STRAY ANDO FIFTEE AND METERS STRIN AND ON THE GRAF WE WED DO THE THERTY CENN BEDERS SDRING THEND WE COND HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOR FIVE S SEVEN LL T TWENY PR HAPS OR THIRTY AND THEND WE IKE E  TOW ALL WY APE TO THE RIT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GYIVE US THEND THAT WE HAVE AL THE INFORMATION
3848,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PER PAPER AIRPLANES AND VARIABLES THAT ARE FO UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPERCLIP AND TAPE AND IT FLIES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,UH YOU COULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VERYABAL AT E TIME ECAUSE THE JUST DEMONSTRATION TO SHOW US FO RPER PAPPR PLAYINS IN VERYABLS OND F FROM IF IT DUSN'T FLY WELL AND THEND YOU HAD A PAPPER CLIPE AND CAPE IN A FLAS BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT FMAKE IT BETER SO THAT'S WY OUL MY CHANGE ONE ATHER TIME
3849,UM VARIABLE IS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD AFFECT IT,M VERIABLL  THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE M THE VEVORIBALE WE CHANGE IT WAS THE MATH THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VERIABLL WE CHANGE LEANGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IFH OW OD OFECT IT
3850,M WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID LIKE IT UM SWUNG MORE MORE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE,UH W WAND WE OM TRIY THE STRING WLAINKTH A SHORTER STRAYING DID  AND UM SWOMNG MORE MORE AN FIFTEEN SECKENDS SO ON IN THE LONGER STRINGS THI DO GO LONGER TO SWIMMAYEREALY ONLY GOIT EAT OR NINE
3851,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT CONTROLLED,WL IT'S LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY M HAVE A CPL DIFFERENT STRINGS THEEACH DIFFRENT LANKTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LANKTH O THE STRING SO AN  MAKES AT CANTROL
3852,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SIZED OF PAPERCLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPERCLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL UM WE LITHER DIFERENT SISE PAPPER CLIPS THE WEEK ANTD THE SAME SISE OF PAPPER CIP THE ALL TIME AND UM WL WE UM IT'S VERY MUCH IT H WE CHANGE THE WY THE PEN WE CHANGE THE LAINKE THE TRAYING AND YETH IT'S VERY MUCH
3853,NO WELL THE PAPERCLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPERCLIP SIZE,M UH THE PAPPER PSICE WE CAP THAT THE SAME THE HOLL TIME AND THAT'S PERDY MUCHPWE CHANGE THE PENIS LIKE THE WET AND WE CHANGE  LANGTH TOR THE TRING SO O INE WEEK A THE SAME AS THE PAPPER ICES
3854,OKAY WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS OF THE BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT,E WORING ABOUT HELL THE PENULOM SMOTHE AND IF TUHE MAS AND TA BOB FEX IT OR IF THE LAGH O THE STRING OF<unk>
3855,UM THE WAY WE SHOWED THE RESULT IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT LIKE WELL WE HELD IT AND WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER,AND WHE WISHTHE RESALTIS OUR TEACHER TIME US SAND WE CAT WE CAPT IT PLAYING WHEN WE HELDIT EN CHESE HAD GO WE COUNTED TENI SWINGS DID AND THEE TIME DOSN'T HE STORP WHEN WAS FIFTEEN SECENDS ON THE COCK SO AT'S WE FOUND OUT OR ANSER
3856,M,E
3857,UM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME,THE MOST IMPORTTING IS I ONLY CHANGE ONE VERYBLE ANDE TIME
3858,UM WELL THIS KIND OF CONNECTS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU CAN DO TO SHOWS ALL THE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT JUST LIKE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR LIKE THE SLOPE LIKE RIGHT HERE,SO THIS IS THE SKANDESTAND IS EXACT LIKE OR PLAIN S WE HAVEN'T CHI WE I THINK WE MIYTE CHANGE UM
3859,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE,IT LOK IT LOKS LIKE T PEOPLEREXPERMENTING HOW FARE IT WAN WIL GO WITH A DIFFRENT AINGL
3860,UM YOU,AM Y<unk>
3861,WELL WE FIGURED OUT IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT,WELL WE HRI TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPOUNDS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PRSON O THE WAY BUH  START IT'S RONG CAUSE IT'S I UST TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PRSON OF TWO METERS BUT THISIS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO MEEATERS SO THIT'S CRAFT DOSN'T LOK LIKE IT'S COREACT
3862,UM THE RUBBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES GETS IT TO MOVE,UM THE<unk>IT'S IT'S THE MAINE OUR LIKTHAT'S WHAT OUR 'S THA PREPELLOR IT'S LIKE THE ANIEN IT'S UWHATIT MAKES SKATSTO MOVE
3863,THE ANGLE OF THE STRING BUT YEAH,ANGS RIN BU YEAH
3864,FOUR METERS SORRY I MEAN IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS,FOR MEATERS SORRY I MAYI  LIKE TOGOSWONE FOR MEATERS ATD FORT FIVE INDES
3865,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,UH E LOOKS LIKE REAL WAYCH TI SE HOWFU AD THE PLAINE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WHINDS AND YEAH
3866,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,UM<unk>JCOOKE W HAVE THE PREPELLOR THE ROBER ENYY WISTED T UP  IKE GO DOUN THE FISHING LIE BECAUSE UM YET M PREPELORUR AND AN TY I THE OIN PASTORNINEU TO SEE WO THE   WICH ARE THE PASNGEUS ARE PAPPER ATCLIPS AND
3867,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WL SPIING POURS A HAT'S THE MAINE POWUR O THE PLAIN WITH THOUT IT NOTTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN JUST AND SIT THERE
3868,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,HOW WREAK UR HOMANY TIMES YOU WIND IT I WOUD E HCK THE TRING ORKE WHU METERIALS YOU YUSE TO BUILD IT THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
3869,S SO,SSO
3870,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THE THE  K IT'S GOING UP WIRL AND YEAHLJUST SLITLY O MATCH UH YEAH
3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,UM THE SPIING CAN KE ORPLAIN AND THIS WSEE HOW OS CAN I GO IT LOOKSLIKEIPRTY FAR FOR MEEATERS WITH FORTY FIVE WMINDS SOW YEAH
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,YOU NEED SOMEKIMDS OF OWUR IN THIS SKACE ORCE IS THE ROBER AY AND WITCH  TWIST THE PREPELOR BUT UM ALSO NEED SOME T YLSTOHAVEA ROB THAT H FISCHING WARS TO GO IN AND WE V LIKE CHEARS SO THAT THE WAIR LIKE SLAY ON SO AIT THE WAYR RK WE CAN THAVETHE WATCH THE CHARS AND UM YEAH J CAIN'D I HAVE PAYPM TWO PAYPER CPES INTHE B I POT THE PREPEORAOM JUST TWISED THAT'S RERLY MUCH
3873,HI,HI
3874,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DE PENS  YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FOR I CAN GO WO HOW FAST REALLY TE PENDS BUT ANDI ALSO VERYBCHANGE BUT  YOU CAN DSYE WAT HOW FAST I WANTED TO GO HOW FARE IT'S ROL AR DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE
3875,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,UM WL ARECERS TOLD US TAT M  ACTUALLY ALITL MOR THN HAF WEATS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PRSSENT AND NE WE IT L E ATTHEU B CORRECT BECAUSE I TOK TWENTY FIVE SPENTS FOR UST TO GO UI'M SEVENTY FIVE PRESSENT OF TWO MEATERS BUT HERE OUL HAVE TWENTY TWO HIN FOR TWO MEATERS SO ID BE IN CORECT AND UM YEH
3876,W WELL WE HAVE A S WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN IN HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THIS S PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND THE PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE,WELL WE HAVE A WE HAVE THREE STROIS WELL E GO HEN M HERE THE PICTURE THERE 'S THE TWO THAT GO THETHAN WE HAVE TWO PAPPUR CLIPS TAYBOLD ON EACH SIDE NAND WE LT HAVE THE T PREPELLOR PZ OR ROBER BAND ZZA  IN THE BAG THAT CONNECT THE ROBER BANAND THE SE TMAKE THIS PLAIN
3877,UM ONE THING THAT AFFECT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAN AFFECT IT IS THE TYPE OF STRING IN OUR CASE WE'RE DOING FISHING WIRE BUT T IT COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING OR UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS AND THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS,UM ONETHING AFCSHO MANY PNS YOU DO OBVIOUS LY AND ANOTHER THING EFED IS THE TYPE OF STRING KAY FISHING WAR BUT YOUCAUSE DE PEND TAN TE STRING YURE USING ERE UH MANY THINGS IT COND AFCK BUT I THINK THE NOMBEROF SINS IN THE TYPE OF STRING OR N DO THE MAINE THINGS
3878,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ANGLED LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CL IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT,WEOWN I L GO FARTHER BUT IMBINFOR EXAMPL UL LIKE STREEAT OUP IT'S NOT CA I GET ANY WERE AND F YOU FYOU JSLITLY AND OLD UPI L SLOWDOWNBECAUS IT'S RUNDLIKE CLIM A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M IF YOU'RE CLIMBING AA HILL YOU CAN MORE EXSOASTIENE FOM GOING UP THE HILL TEND GOING DOWN IT
3879,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS UP WE WANT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE WO A YARD AND A HALF,WE ACTUALY WE HAVE AN CULY BUT WE WANT TO GET ORSWE WANT BUT THE GOL ST MAKE OUS MOVE YOR IN HAF
3880,UM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND,UH I NEEDN'T THINK ABOUT HOVE MANY INS WE MAKE AND WE NED HAVE CHANGE IT IF IT DOUSN'T WORK<unk>ONEDAY ANT A TIMEIN
3881,WELL THE THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE ON THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER,WL DON'T THE BOTUM WHIN ZA CAN FLY S FOR BECAUSE IT'S AMPE OP SO IT HAS HAS TO WUSE MORE OUR TO GET OP AND ONE THE THOPIL GO A LOT FIRTHER
3882,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAKE AIRPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE,WITHE IND MAKEING TIGER PLAINS ET GO ON FISHING WATER
3883,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU'LL YOU COULD CHANGE,WELL YU<unk>CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE  FISHING WATER YOU CAN CHANGE THE LANKTH O THE ROBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGERE THE MORE UR YOU CAN CHANGE THE TYPE OF FOR ELOR AND FIT LONGER WON AR SHORTER WE FTHERE'S A THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE B Y THINK THOR'S A THE MAN THANKS YOU YOU CAE CHANGE
3884,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE,IT LOOKS LIKE THER MADE A PLANG JUST LIKE US AND HLOKS LIKE IT'S GING PBET BH NATURBLOKS LIKE IT'S A PRELY GOOD PLAINE
3885,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FORTY FIVE,IT LOKS LIK O TO SWIM FORTY FIVE
3886,BYE,
3887,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GO BUMPY AND THEN IT'LL LIKE AFFECT IT AND WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEED A WELL THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOOTH LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR UH STEEP UP OR ELSE IT'LL UM THEN IT'LL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTNT EDGOS SMOUTHLY CAN'T LIKEBUMIN AND HAT'SNETO HAVE A NICE SMOTH MINE IT CAN'T BE TWO F STIP UPRILDES AT ALL UM THET IWONT MAKE IT UP IFE NO MATHOW MANY TWES YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH
3888,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS,WE JST LIKEYU IF YOU NEED  MAKE IT GO FARTHER  GIF YOU WANT  MAKE TO GO FARTHER WELL ENEOU NEED AT CHANGE THAT OBVIOUS LY IN IT SEEM LIKE CHANCE THE WINESE OR SO TAT JUST TO GET A DIFFRNT ANER AND SEE HOW DIFRFRENT IT IS
3889,WHAT,WHAT
3890,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,WEL YOU O MAKE THE PLN AND IT'S A LOT O DIFRINT THINGS
3891,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING,A MATIC ROLER ORS SOMETHING
3892,YEAH YEAH THAT'S,YEAH YES
3893,HI,HIE
3894,THERE'S ONE HUNDRED,IS INE HUNDGED
3895,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F N,SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALY BE EF
3896,YEAH,YAH
3897,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS,E OT WE ALL GO THREE WHEN WE GOT EARS
3898,A RULER YEAH,UH A ROER YEAH
3899,Y LIKE THIS,LIKE THIS
3900,YES YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY,YES YEAH THEY WOER ALL ECCALY
3901,YEAH,YEAH
3902,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING,SO THEN WE KNO ARGYOU ABOUT EVERY THING
3903,BECAUSE I WAS OUR S THE STRAWS ON OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE'S SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT,BECAUSE<unk>THESTRAS AT ARE TEAM AR SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE H THEY HAVE DIFFRENT MESGERMENTS FOR IT
3904,YEAH,YEAH
3905,WE LEARNED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM CAN,E<unk>CHICK ISTOME CAN
3906,IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THE,IT'S MESERIN DO
3907,YEAH,YEAHS
3908,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL,LIKE GS AND MAKES EVERYTHING EACKOE
3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,INE HANEARD CEN MDAIES
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SO TH WE SA SE DON'T KNOW  ROLERTH DIDN'T THE TATR ARGOW IN LEST  THAT MYT NOT BE ATOALE AR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE MATCIC SISTOME SO WE IS A MATHTICTM TO CONTACT WITH THE CUNTRY
3911,OH NO,NO
3912,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF WE'RE ONE METRIC ONE METER HIGH NO,LET US NOW WHHOW THA WY ARE I GOVE FOR ONE ATURE ONE MEADER HI NO
