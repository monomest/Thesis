1,OKAY,
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,WE AVENT REALLY N  GRAPMCH THISS YEAR
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,THE JUST SIRCULES INHEEN WE WLD TRY EVERY WONE WILD START  THER DES H MNEY SWINGS THEY DOT THE W UMR
4,YEAH,YELLOW
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,OKVER CRS YOUR ANSAR AND S YO AC YOU WDN'T OER JUST   I I JU F THE NEXT DAYYOU CN
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE'VE ATED TOO PUES I THINK THE HOL CAS WAS CON VINCETI DIDN'T MATER SURE AFTR THAT WE SRT RODO LENGHRI
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,B THEEXSPEENTI LIKE THE BEST WE WILD STARTE AA THOLY WE L SO DDNI'M NOT SURESE AN Y PANTSTSO OAT I'M NOT SOR IFIT
8,YEAH A LITTLE,ALL
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,FR WE TARTED A NOMBER LINE HORS ONTL BES A CROSS WE HAD A TEECARFRT WE STARTED FROM THE BIG  LENGTHEN THE OTHERINGS SO TEN SEVEN MEATERS I THE W PT AX SM THE W PT THE LENGTHP
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,THE FRS TIM IT WAS SORTO LIKE THAT SUTH DOW I ENT DOWN IHE WE TRYED THE NEXTAYATR WE TRYEDA SOURT OF CAMVITH S WAS THE OEBIGR WASLN
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,WE FURST TRYED TOHLD AR EST  AR EST WE WD HTHWE GST H MONE WE CUD  FIFT SECUNDS I GET ABOUT SIXTENSO WE RYONTHER SEVEN MEATERS WEE DID THERTE SEVEWE TRY TO E GO FASTER LOGR

15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,DIDN'T RALLYCHANGE
16,OKAY,
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE A SORT OF GOUGHT BIGER THE NMR AHLY IT GT MLR THE NOMBER STARTED  BITHE LE WING WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,A PY MUCH IN THE SAME PLASE EVERY ONE REALLY A START
19,OKAY,OCAN
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,R WE WE TRY TO THINK AT COULDECTHE THREE THINGS WE DID ASSTARTING PIWE SAVEN'T TRYD THE FORS YET I THINK THE O HORCES GON
21,YEAH,
22,OKAY,
23,NO,L
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,MY SISTER DINT OBODI A AOA SWG OA  YOU  STRINGSITH PAPT DIT YOUGT SORR O HAVE THE OST WINGSO THE STROAKE THEA SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SCOND YOUL HAVE TO MAKE THE THE ATRG AGR
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,KLKING A PERMENTS WITHTHEWR TRYING TO IGEROTT WE  DASTING  FIFTEEN SECANDSWE  HANG ABOUT A PANTLE ON THE ENTOFOR DESTWEAWE D SEE HO MNEY SWEINS WE CA GT FIFTEE SECANDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,HEN WE TRY TO D WE STARTED A BOTR BTER ADI DIDN'T RELLY SE HAVEING IXSPERMNTUN TL EVERY ON DIDN'T RLING
27,OKAY,SLOCKA
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAD AYE
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,TIAE ME TH MOST SIRPRISEHE YOU STARTED YOU DIDN'T REALLY ACTOOLY SWHNTHE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,LIK SEVEPEOPLE  ILEVN SME PEOPLE GUGHT THERTTYE FOURTT
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I'VE JUST STARTED TO HELP THATGES
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,THE SWRINGIS GO BTHSTARTES HE IT GOS B
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE S WE WE WACHD FOUR WE LWE WACHED AL THE AY OVER TOTNOR STICRES N LU UPO W  MAR ALL DORINGFOND LIKE THIS

41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VEN WRING WITHA COLD BUNCH OFA EXSPERMENT I TUT LIKE ANTOTHBTS A FLIRS IN THE S
42,YEAH,YELLOW
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,WE R W WE SHELD A CLASSE THAIDN'TARE

46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,I A CIND OF  DUTHE SIX THE AWT CAME OF EXSPERMANT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,IF WE HAVE A STAMPERT I YOUTHE NOTAWARK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VSOMTHING THET UTMO AN EXSPERMENT AXPERMENT ISYOUD ST SOMTHING TH YO  T YOU TRY NEW THINGS FD
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,WITH THE RE ZALTWEOURTED THEM O A GRAFFE
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,I LOOCKED LIKE THA P
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,OWE'VE JUST FINISHED ING THE SORS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WSHOH  GLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,WILL E E TLIHVE  PUT MARKS ONTH STICK SIX FIVE FOUR THREEWE WENTE FROM SIXTO ELEVATO TWONDW
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,E'L ATOLY S
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,IMNOTSURBECAUS WE TESTED WE GOUGHT A ANCAR AND ST
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,YOD HAVE TO LOK A WEAE FOUR TIMESFOUR WE GOU THE ATHWALTHE FRST T MY SING THE FRST TIME SIX ALATHE STICK WAS ALL SIX THE FRST TIME WET SECND TIME E UT HNDRED FIFTY THE THEURD TIM OR E FOUR TIME WE WE A AO THE  FOUR
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WE AL CAME UP WITH VER ALMOST E O THE O CAT SHS LIK YOU PIKO PEOPLE THREE PEOPLTHE  II WHEN THEY WONTED TO DO WE ENTERED INGAI HE ARING STICK CATS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE WACHED AL THEY HOW FV STICT  TE   WE STARTED  A E CH I IXI WENT TO SIX ON THE T S SER WE WENT TO SIXTHE
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,CLD STILAN THE EX RAXIS IS WT WE NEW ITHE RAIS WE WONTED TO FIND OUT T WEV FOUNDOW
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT TH ASO IN THE STICLESCUS WE NEW HOF WE PUT T STICKTHE NE BYAIES WAS HO HY WREEN
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,IF ONE ASUS A R NEXT NEXTA THEY WILDNT BE THE SAME BECAUS THY DON'THE SAM LOOK THE SAME SIS AL
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,E SEM STICK OL THEWA W TD STICX R APTHOLYMY TR DIDN'T A GREE WITH THES  RD VER ACTHOL GUGT IERBC WS RELLYWWEHE PEOPLE T TRY EHER BUING THE CLASS II TRY THE STICKS  TTTRY TRY HE PUSH TH STICKS ALTHEA I SIX  REALYY WE GAU H OPSE

64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,THAT WAS FARTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,ASOOIT WAS IN AOREONS FORUELER JUST FOR THE
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,PLAN LOOKED LIKE T
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,E AVE YR  FORTHE PASSNGERSAOS JUST LIKE WE PASSONGERS B RETH O PASSNGERSA ARDERWEAR TSTING THE VERRIBLYWE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T GESTRDYWE DIDN'T HAVE A MUCH TIME BE CAUS WE I
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,THE NEXT DAY WE  WE WR TRYING WEM HAF MATORSWE  HF MARCLTRYN TO SEE HOW MUCHD
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE'VE JUST JUST GA TATUM
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WEJS TR THE JUST PLAYD ROIWE GUG I  WE'V PUT ON ENO THE CHAR D AHOLTHE THETHER   T SIX TIMS O  THE LETMOTTIM THE FRSTTIM WWE GOUGHT SIXT M R ON NEXT DEAY WE ONLY GOUGHT FIFTY

76,YEAH YEAH,E
77,YEAH,YELLOW
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THEGRAS T WE  THIS VERRIBLE BOOKI SOS HOSA WOMEN WINGI PIK MR HEAD JUSTTHIS WOMEN WIS DEWING A HANDS PRING  THETDI RELLY

114,WELL I RE I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OUR BUT UH WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETER I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AMO MILLILITERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY,IOMEMBER  CH WATER WE EIN M THEM I THE FIVE MATERS I THINK NOT SUR THE WHAT WE R GOING TOD TODAY
115,YEAH CAUSE THIS IS THE Y AXIS I THINK X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE Y AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGERS,BECAUSE THIS IS THE WG THIS WILL BE THE PASTONDGER
116,UM THAT WAS WE WOULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY IN S YOU COULD JUST FLIP OVER,WE RET A  SOR WA SOURT OF CAS INSIDE EVEN WITH YOU PANWE  PT OSIDEY ASLY YOU HAVE P  RELLYACSSER BON PT AN NOTHER MAN

142,AND THEN,AR
143,YEAH,YELLOW
144,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,WE AD DIFREN SIDESSWEET SR ING LIK FIVE SEVE MATOR THREE SEVENTOR OEAOWASWE OTED TO SEE HA MUCH WATER WE CU PT IN EACH ONLI WATER FOM TH  R SRTH SRP INALTED E WE G A NOATRE
145,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OA VERIOBLOVERIOBTINKS YOU SHAS R DT T CAUMWE MA VERIOBLE THE WATER HAS TO BE STILD IT A B LIKE RUF WATERS IN CAS GROATERISIS
146,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING,WE OERD JUST LOOK LIKE THARPS
147,YEAH,YELW
148,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,S WAS AR JUITHETHE CO PASSODEY WE TOUGHT F THAT WHTE COPASEWHE DIDN'T GET HA REALLY MISROTE
149,YEAH,YELLOW
150,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,UE I TOKE  CALLRY WE DIDN'THE MAHE D SIGHS A THE E
151,BOATS I THINK WHAT LI UM,A BADS I THINK
152,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,WEV TALKE ABOUT IT YESTERDAYWEV TALKED ABOUT
153,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME,NOT SIN
154,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,WE AL MAT THER  FR OAR PASSONDERS LIKE THE STEADEROTHBRD OURA TWELLVE TWENTY SIX PASSONGERS
155,YEAH,Y
156,UM YEAH,Y
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,CASWE TRY TVTH OROLLE GLASSE TRY TO FIND WE CD  AN M CONCLUSIONHT WE REALLYTK THE PANE THREE ETER BS I THERBATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,RO
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CGT LIK THAT FAR FROM THE BOTM HEBOTEM ONLY W TO THE BOTEM WATER
160,YEAH,YEL
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,BAS ID WE OT A HAVE A EXPLENATION FO E HAPEND AFTER WARDS Y OA A FINEL COMCLUSION  CUM AMOST ALL VARBLES  E PASSONDIERES IN EA THTHAR AR FINEL COMCLUSION WIT TE THRE MEATER YOU OLTWELV TWEL ANEASE

835,THE COOKIE IS PROVIDING THE COOKIE IS PROVIDING FOOD FOR THE YEAST AND THE WATER IS MAKING IT COME ALIVE AGAIN IT WAS FROM IT'S DORMANT STAGE,XPEUSE BHEWIS PREVIDING FD FOR THE YUS IN THE WATERS MAKING A FOMETHE STAGE
836,PLANTS DON'T REALLY NEED SHELTER,GRADS DON'T REALLY THE SALTER
837,SO ONE THAT'S YELLOWISH GREEN AND THE ONE THAT WAS RED GREEN WAS IN THE LIGHT,THA YELLOWWEEM WAS IN THE DORG FD GREENLAE
838,THEY DO I THINK THEY DO CAUSE WATER IS ESSENTIAL TO ALL LIFE YES ALL LIFE,ITHINKBWATER IS I CENCR TO ALLLIFEE
839,THE SUNLIGHT WATER AND CHLOROPHYLL INSIDE THE LEAVES,TUNIE ATER IN CALOI
840,AIR IS NOT PLANTS DO NOT LIKE WIND THAT MUCH AND THEY DON'T NEED IT,A DOS NOT LIKE WNSO MUCH A EDOT EADIT
841,A BOTTLE WITH TOMATO AND A PLANT LIKE AGAIN,THE FOGTHERM WAS TOMATOE IN A PLAN
842,I SEE A CHEESEBURGER AND A PLANT THE CHEESEBURGER MEANS FOOD AND YES THE PLANT DOES NEED FOOD EXCEPT DIFFERENT SORT OF FOOD NOT LIKE THAT,ITHINKKEATE BERG INS A PLANW CHEATSE BG MES FD  THEPLAN FRENSORT
843,IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING VERY HEAVY YOU NEED TO USE KILOGRAMS,L HAD SOME THING VERY CALLAM
844,SOUNDS LIKE KILL A GRAM,SIN LIKE A GRAFD
845,COULD I HOLD IT FOR A SEC,COULD HOLDIT
846,WE HAD LIKE TWENTY PIECES AND FIVE PIECES AND TEN PIECES AND ONE PIECES,LTWENTY FIVE PASS TEN PAS
847,YEAH,
848,WITH THE PIECES,WIS
849,YES,S
850,MMM HMM WITH ROCKS WE WE UM WE HAD TEN DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THAT EACH ONE OF US MEASURED OUT A HUNDRED GRAMS IN ROCKS,WITHWE TEN DIFRENT GREOPS IN EATCH O MASER A HONDERED CRAO ROCKS
851,THEN YOU NEED TO ADD MORE TO THE ONE OR ANOTHER,S A N OTHER
852,UH SOMETIMES IN PAPER CLIPS BUT UM,SOMETIMES ON PR
853,OR A FRIDGE,VERAGE
854,AND THEN WE PUT IT ALL IN A BAG,WE PUT A OLIN
855,WHAT HAPPEN,AIC
856,WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT ON IT'LL PROBABLY TELL YOU THE ANSWER,PUOTHE
857,A STANDARD MEASUREMENT E IS LIKE THE METRIC SYSTEM IT'S ALL THE SAME EXCEPT FOR IN AMERICA,TH STANDERD IS LIKE THA MADICITM ALL THE SAME
858,JUST A SEC,U
859,YEAH,
860,I COULD TELL THEM A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,I CAN TELLATHOUSOND CAMPLERAF
861,YES YOU NEED TO HAVE A STANDARD TO DO,YOU EDN'T HAVE A STAMP
862,WELL TODAY WE HAVEN'T DONE MATH YET,WE HAVE A G MAFIEWD
863,YOU PUT THE GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY MEASURED OUT UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY LEVEL IT'LL,THE PUTA GRAM PESE ON THE OTHERSI COMPLEET COMPLEET
864,THE INK,S
865,WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS IT'S JUST,THCLASS
866,B L T,REY
867,UM WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS IS JUST BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE,WHE THE SM CLASSSJUT BACGRNOLOGE
868,BUT WE HAD GROUPS OF FOUR,WE HAD GRIEOPS FOR
869,HELLO,LLOW
870,OR A MICROWAVE,MICROWAVES
871,NOT REALLY,RALY
872,AND THEN WE PUT IT OUR HUNDRED GRAMS INTO ONE BIG BAG,WE PUT  A THNER WITHAG
873,UH A D A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS,THE PILGRM CHIF THAT WAS LIKE SIX C
874,OKAY LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A STEEL BALL JUST COMPLETELY CIRCULAR STEEL BALL AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND THEN A VASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOWL SO THE WHEN THE WATER FALLS OUT IT'LL GO INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL INTO THE WATER MOST OF THE YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WATER'S IN IT THOUGH FOR THIS TO WORK WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL IN WHEN THE WATER COMES OUT AS MUCH WATER IS STILL IN THE VASE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S IN IT BECAUSE IT PUSHES IT OUTWARD UNTIL IT'S SETTLED,YOU HAVE A STEAPCOMR VASEYOU PUTYOU PUT THE STEABL IN THE ATERYOU HAVE HAS MUCH WATERIS IN PUTTE WATERMCHTER STILL IN THE VASEBSI PUSH I SATELD
875,WHAT HAVE WE WORKED ON THIS WEEK WELL THIS WEEK THE IN THE THREE DAYS IN THIS WEEK WE'VE WORKED ON MEASUREMENT AND MASS,E WRKE DOWN THE  IN THE TREESWE RKD A MASER MENT
876,UH HUH OR LEVEL,FORLEVER
877,HOW THAT WORKS IS IT'S LIKE A PRESS,HOTHEA LIKE ARE
878,I KNOW AS IN LIKE KILL A GRAM,HD B T  CRAM
879,HOW DO I MEASURE MASS WITH THE BOWL AND THE THE UM VASE AND THE STEEL BALL OR OR ANYTHING YOU WANT LIKE AN ORANGE OR,W HVE MY MEOT WITH THE BIRS HAND DDOOR ENEY THING O LR
880,YOU HAVE TO DEPEN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON,ASERPAON I PUT
881,WE PUT IN TEN OF THOSE,WEPUT IN CENTROS
882,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED,RPEE TOOBAGS FLL OFAH
883,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,THOUSANA THOUSAND GRAND E GOS A CALOT DRAP
884,GRAMS YEAH OH I JUST THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE,OI JUST LO SA
885,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHING IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP,MAT IS THE AIASEOTHING CAES OT
886,HA IT WEIGHED LIKE TWENTY,TWENTY
887,THAT THAT WOULD BE WAIT JUST A SEC,AWIL BEU
888,SEVEN SEVEN INCHES,SEVENG
889,PROBABLY THE MASS,PO
890,AND THAT ADDED UP IN TO TWO HUNDRED,N TOH
891,WE HAD A SCALE,WE HAD A SCEL
892,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME,DEPENTING ON THE PRBL THE SAM
893,YES,YES
894,IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE MORE HEAVY,BE  HEY
895,MMM HMM AND THEN PUT THEM INTO A ONE BIG BAG AND THEN IT EQUALED ONE KILOGRAM,TTE PUT THERI ONE BIG ATH EA
896,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF A TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WHEN IT'S ON,WHO CULD I PLY THE MASRT WATER
897,NO BECAUSE ALL PA THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE IT'D BE SMALL,THER IS MANY DIFRN SIDSBECAUSE IN YOUR CASE WHALL BE SMOLLE
898,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MATH MASS IS WITH WATER O A BOWL AND A VASE,WHVE YOU WITH WATERA ND A VACE
899,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRAM PIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OUR GRAM PIECES WE MEASURE LIKE E THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE GRAM PIECES,HELP ME DI WITH A GRAM PASTESHEN WEOSING OAUR CRAM PEASENS E MAS I THI PEAS OF DS THREE RAM PESES
900,WELL THE MASS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASS THAT THESE TAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT QUARTERS OF THIS TABLE,MASSOTING LIKE MASS TAKES UP HIS PROPL ABOUTT CRR
901,YES,Y
902,SO IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SI SIX SIX FIVE GRAMS,ZR ITS PROLY ABOUT SIX SIX FIVE GRA
903,BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE RIGHT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,CAUSEVERYBOY WI BE RIT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPN
904,FALLS OUT,UT
905,NO TEN HUNDRED GRAMS,TENGAM
906,TODAY,
907,YEAH AND WE EACH MADE FIFTY GRAMS,HWE UEA FIFTY GRANDS
908,YEAH YEAH LIKE UM LET'S SAY A TOASTER,LIKE THE BIRDSIDE  TOASTER
909,ESTIMATING IS LIKE A GUESS,AHMATING ISLIKE G
910,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT,POP YUSELO
911,WE CAN USE A GRAM PIECE FOR MEASUREMENT,E CAN LOUS A GRA  PEAS FUL MESIER MENT
912,HOW I DID IT,OANTAG
913,AND THE HEAVIEST ONE WAS THE LUG NUT,THE HEVYW WAS GA
914,GRAMS,GRAWL
915,I DID THAT IN MY HOMEWORK,A N
916,E THEY HAD THIS LITTLE WHITE BAR AND THEN THIS PIECE THAT GOT POKED OUT FROM THE INSIDE OUT NOT LIKE A HOLE BUT LIKE E IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT LIKE THE INSIDE OF IT LIKE THAT'S THE REGULAR INSIDE OF IT AND THEN IT'S LIKE THAT,EARE HAVE THA SIL WI BR POPED OUPT FROM THE INSID LOOK L INSIDET LK AT
917,THEY MIGHT THINK BELIEVE ME BUT IF THEY'RE SMART THEY WOULDN'T,THE MIGT SANG LIEFMBU T
918,YES WHY THAT'S HELPFUL IS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS,BCASWHYI THE EP BOS DON'TNOT THE WHEATHERI
919,HOW MIGHT THAT HAPPEN IS BE JUST BECAUSE PHYSICS,LK THAT HAPN JUST BECASFISIX
920,WE WERE MEASURING TEMPERATURE WITH A THERMOMETER,AA TEMPETURE WITH ZIRROUDA
921,IT DOESN'T FREEZE LIKE EXACTLY THEN LIKE,YOU DOESENT AS EGZACLY
922,BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS OUR LAST DAY OF MEASUREMENT,BECAUS YESTERDAY WAS A LASTMN
923,OVER TIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE ICE STARTED TO MELT,VERTIME IT GOT HTER THE ICE STARTED TOMILL
924,THAT'S THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS,THATCS DIFRENTOMENTS
925,IS IT ALWAYS ENDS UP IN A THOUSAND,AAN ALWAYS RS OPAN THOUSAND
926,WELL I WON'T BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE AN ENTOMOLOGIST,BECUS EHOLOGYST
927,WE WE MEASURED LIKE WATER,RMASUREDD WATER
928,THEY'RE LIKE THAT,ILICKETHAT
929,BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT WITH FREEZING,BECAUSE E PEN  WITH PREIG
930,PUT IT IN A KETTLE,PUTCATO
931,METER TAPE,MOU
932,UM NOT REALLY NO BECAUSE IT'S S JUST ALL OF IT IS PHYSICS,M THR BECAUSE YO SHOUD GIST TELEVATOSICS
933,A IS THE HOTTEST B IS THE COLDEST COLD OVERWHELMS HOT,THE ARDIST SODVER AMS
934,IT STARTS TO BOIL OR FREEZE,LOYAL RAS
935,YES,YELOS
936,I'LL HOLD IT,OUHOLDER
937,CELSIUS TIME,SOAM
938,THE ICE WAS MELTING AND WHEN THE ICE MELTS THE ICE TURNS INTO COLD WATER BUT AFTER THAT WHEN THE ICE WOULD'VE MELTED TWO TIMES IT TURNS INTO C IT TURNS INTO HOT WATER,THCETHE ICEE THE ICE TURNS IN THE COLD WATERH I MELTEDTR
939,HELLO,YELOW
940,THIS IS A LINE GRAPH AND THIS I MEANS THAT THIS WAS,THIS IS A LOINGRAFFEVI MEN THIS WA
941,WE DID MEASUREMENT YESTERDAY,WE' DIDMA YES ST
942,ZERO IS LIKE THIRTY IT'S THIRTY SOMETHING DEGREES FAHRENHEIT,ZERO IS LIKE THRY THRY SMTHING
943,WELL WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE WE DID THIS EARLIER NOT YESTERDAY AND WELL A IS TWENTY DEGREES B IS LIKE TEN DEGREES AND THEN C IS OH OH LIKE TWENTY DEGREES TOO WELL A AND C A IS ACTUALLY THE THE UM ROOM TEMPERATURE ONE C IS THE HOT ONE AND B IS THE FREEZING COLD ONE,WILL  GOIN ON IN THIS PICTURE WI DID IS EROPLITEE I T BE TNAPOR TEMPTER A OT WN CAN BEATS  RETS ING COLD ER
944,WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES IT TAKES BUT IT'S TAKES LIKE THREE HUNDRED DEGREES TO GET TO BOILING POINT,ATAK LIKE THREE HONDERED D GREES THA BLIINGP
945,YEAH RULERS ACTUALLY YOU LIKE IT IT'S LIKE A YARD STICK I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED MMM,ACTHOALLY UMPLINE A YARD STICK I CAN'T RE MEMBER WHT IS L
946,THE METRIC SYSTEM FOR THE CELSIUS THE REST OF THE WORLD USES THE METRIC SYSTEM AND AMERICA USES FAHRENHEIT,THE MAOTHE WRLD YUI  ARICAMA
947,YEAH,YEL
948,IT BOILS AT A HUNDRED,LH
949,THE THE THE OL WE DID THAT IN STRAWS,REEPD THE STRAS
950,WHEN ARE WE GOING TO BE DONE,WH
951,YEAH THAT'S ZERO YEAH YES,DATCH ZERRO PAS YOU
952,AND THEN WHEN IT WHEN THIS DOT THAT'S AT TWO FOUR THAT'S LIKE AT EIGHT,EVVE EN THIS DOG THATS LIK
953,NO,OL
954,WHAT'S GOING ON IS OVER LIKE ONE ONE HOUR IT WAS A RIGHT THERE,H I OVELIK NE ATER
955,HOW OFTEN WHE DID WE DO THAT WE DID IT EVERY TEN MINUTES ACTUALLY EVERY HOUR,HO SOFFTEND WE D THATWE DIDN'T EVERY TEN MINIT
956,WHAT'S ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH,WETORN THE BOLTUMRAFFT
957,NO,
958,YES,YE
959,IT FREEZES,IS
960,WATER WITH MILLILITERS AND LITERS,ATE WITH MEL LEADERS LEADERS
961,WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS BELOW ZERO IT STARTS TO FREEZE,IT HAPEN WHENIGLZERO S
962,THOSE ARE ICE CUBES WHEN THE ICE CUBES MELT THEY'RE GONNA TURN INTO WATER AND THAT WATER'S GOING TO BE COLD WHICH IS GOING TO FILL IT UP FILL IT UP MORE WHICH,ICERU THE ICE CRUT MELTEN WATERA WATER IS GOING E COD
963,NO IT'S GONNA START WARMING UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT,ICA START IY DDN'T
964,BECAUSE IT'S VERY STRAIGHT,BECAUSE IS VERY STRAT
965,MORE,FOUR
966,THAT'S SHOWING CELSIUS,THAT SJOING
967,THOSE LOOK LIKE DICE,AKICE
968,TIME IN MINUTES,TM
969,IT WILL START TO FREEZE,WELL STARTE TH
970,WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIVE AND THEN FIFTY FIVE,WACHEDTHE DIFRENS BETWEEN THE TWO FIVE FIFTY FIVE
971,WE MEASURED WEIGHT,WHITE
972,WHAT TO WEAR,LAWAYER
973,WE ALSO MEASURED,WE ARE SO MZURD
974,THAT'S SHOWING MINUTES TOO,THAT CHEOWING MI TO
975,WITH GRAMS AND KILOGRAMS,CALGROUND
976,FIFTY,IXTY
977,YEAH,
978,YES AND WE PUT WE MEASURED THE TEMPERATURE JUST WITH THE CUP AN OF THE WATER IT COME CAME OUT NOT FOR EVERYBODY IT DIDN'T COME OUT FOR EVERYBODY AND IT WAS IT WAS ABOUT LIKE ZERO CELSIUS,WE MERED THE TEMPETUR JUST WITHTHEUP O THE WATERCA NOT  EVERY BODY DIDN'TEVERYIT WAS ZEROSUSE
979,THIS WAS TAKING A MAJOR DROP,THAE DRA
980,YES ACTUALLY,A
981,HMM COOL,HOOF
982,NOT REALLY,REALLY
983,BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE THE ICE IS MELTING,BECUSE THE ICE IS MELTED
984,NO THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT ONE YES,THISMO HI IL B AA
985,THAT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS NO ACTUALLY IT'S NOT GONNA BE FIFTY FIFTY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LESS THAN FIFTY BUT I CAN'T PINPOINT EXACTLY THE C,THATH WILL BE FIFTY ACHOL GOING B LES THEN FIFTY I  NPL IGZACLY
986,THEY ALL HAVE A TEMPERATURE,THEY ALL HAS A TEMPTURE
987,OH I MEAN ICE CUBES TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ICE AND THE WATER IN CELSIUS,I MEANU TO SEE TEMPETURE MALRING OF THE ICE  WATER
988,YES IN LITERS IN LITERS AND MILLILITERS,LEADERS IND THELELATER
989,THERE,TAR
990,YES,
991,COLDER,OL
992,OR THREE HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IN FAHRENHEIT,FOUR THREE HONDED D GREES PARNHITETHATS
993,YES IT IS,
994,E AND THEN THIS IS THREE THREE IT'S NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS LIKE EIGHTEEN AND THIS IS LIKE EIGHT,ISI THREENINAPOL U GEN THIS IS LIKE AGHE
995,IT DOESN'T FREEZE EXACTLY THEN,DUSN EAV EACLT
996,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS ONE IS LOWER THE THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS ONE'S THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY YES THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY,WHE GONG O IS THIS OR BECAUS WAS THE FERST ODATATH ABOUT TWENTY
997,WELL THEY ALWAYS USE FAHRENHEIT SO IT'S NOT CELSIUS,THAY ALWAYS YAUS FARN WS NOT
998,YES THE DEGREES OF CELSIUS YES,ESCREESBOIS
999,OR AT SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE THE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU PUT IN IT,SOINTIT DOS THE SAMTH SAME TEMPTERUON
1000,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S HA GONNA HAPPEN IS B'S ACTUALLY GONNA OVERCOME THE A,THEA MAKS SANG A  TE T IS FVE GUPON IS BIS AOL OVERUMTHE
1001,NO SH WE JUST LOOKED AT THE CLOCK,WEVE JUST LROKAA
1002,YEAH IT'S JUST MATH THAT'S IT,MTH
1003,CELSIUS,SOU
1004,CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT,SOU
1005,YEAH,Y
1006,WHAT WE DID WAS WE POURED ICE INTO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERO IT TURNED INTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE NEGATIVE FIVE CELSIUS COLDER,A WIS E PURRASO IN THE TRN FROM ZEROA TN NI FIVE
1007,ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAPH YOU HAVE CELSIUS AND THIS YOU HAVE TIME IN MINUTES,ISIDGRAFF YOU HA
1008,AND THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AND THEN MINUTES AFTER ONE M MINUTE IT W IT WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES,WO OURS HE WS THREE FOUR RON IAFTER TWO MN I WS TE THREE MNITS FOUR  FIVE SIX  SEVEN IN EIGHT MIN IVE INT TEN MINITS
1009,UH HE'S GONNA DIP IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT FRIES CIRCUITS AND THEN HE DIE,TUTAMP IN SIDEA HAPEN IF H REALLY WAS A ROBOT A  FINE CIRCUSS
1010,IT'S BEEN ON FOR A WHILE,WAL
1011,IT'S N IT'S A PRETTY SMALL LE AMOUNT SEE THIS,T A PRTY SMOLLE WNONC
1012,YEAH YEAH LIKE THIS,S
1013,TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE WE PUT TWO KILOGRAMS BAGS ON TWO KILOGRAM BRICKS ONTO IT,SEE PUT T CALLO DRAM OO CALRIBIS
1014,THEY HAVE MILLILITERS IN THEM,THE HAVML LEADERS
1015,WELL THE VIALS WELL W THE VIALS COULD DO IS THEY'D LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS,THE VOLESTHE VOLE C  LIKE SAMMNEY VILES W FILL O CUPS
1016,IT WASN'T TWO HUNDRED GRAMS BECAUSE THERE WAS FROM WATER UM I FORGOT WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE DID DO,N  NDER GROUND BECAUS  WATERI FUT WT IS CA
1017,NO,O
1018,YEAH,Y
1019,MILLILITER IS LIKE A GRAM IN LIQUID,THMILEADER IS LIKE A GRAF
1020,I THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME,ITN
1021,THE LENGTH OF SOMETHING ESTIMATING STUFF LIKE THAT,THE LENG TOS SOMTHINATIG
1022,YEAH,
1023,YEAH WE USED SOME VIALS,SCALWYDS
1024,YES IT WAS TWO HUNDRED,CATO
1025,UM NOT E NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK IS WE FILLED UH BABY DIAPER WITH WATER AND IT GOT LIKE REALLY BIG YEAH SERIOUSLY,COMPL  DOD O THING NOT VERY MUCHYU A BABI DI WITH WATER RIOUS LE
1026,MMM HMM NO NO WE USED UM ROCKS,WE YAUS STOM PROCKS
1027,IN THE METRIC SYSTEM,IAISTUM
1028,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OF LIQUID BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO IT FOR OR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE LEMONADE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OR SIMIL OR LE LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THERE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT A LEMONADE STAND AND ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THEY WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,A STAMPERD FO THEMNDO THE BECASIS LIK LEMEN EATMT WILD HAVE  STANT IPLEIOLLE SRTOO PEOPLE STAADONE GETS A BIG GLASSNDTHE OTHER TS A LT GLASSTHAT WY WE HAVE  STA

1030,IT WOULD TAKE,WDA
1031,NO IT WAS UP TO D,NOATAD
1032,NOT REALLY,REALY
1033,IT'S NOT A METER IT'S A UM SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE LITER IT'S,IS NOT SOMTHING THAT  LE
1034,WHEN WE WEIGHED STUFF IN LIQUID IN LIQUID OR WHAT SOLIDS WE USED GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAW THAT UM TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE KILOGRAM IS A THOUSAND GRAMS,HE WE WATHE STOP I LI ALEDWE GEVES CRAMS FOR N E SALTAR CAL GRAMTWO THOUSAND GRAMS FOR THET  R D
1035,WELL A LITER IS A THOUSAND,THE LEADER IS A THOUSAND
1036,YEAH MILLILITER HOW I REMEMBER THAT IS THE MILLA IS THE LITER IS THE M KING OF THE MILLILITERS,COUI RMEMBER THAT LEADER CINGWADER
1037,LIKE A SURGICAL NEEDLE,LRCHCATO
1038,WITH THE PLUNGER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON IT EACH PLUNGER FULL IS FIFTY,I HAS DIFRNT MESMENTS PLNERFULFIFTY
1039,YEAH,
1040,WELL WHAT WE DID WAS THIS,WHOED WI IS
1041,IT WAS JUST TWO HUNDRED UH NOT TWO HUNDRED LITERS TWO HUNDRED,THE LEADERTO D
1042,WELL WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH LITERS IS THE LITERS,WHU WE'VE BEN DOUWING WITH LEADERTHE LEADER
1043,HI COOPER,
1044,IT'S LIKE A HOLDING A THOUSAND REINS RAISINS IN YOUR HAND RAISINS,I LIKE HLA THOUSAND RADS  YUR
1045,YEAH,R
1046,THEN THERE'S A HUNDRED IN THAT CUP,E A T DR
1047,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOILET PLUNGER LIKE A DA LIKE A UH NEEDLE THING LIKE YEAH YEAH LIKE,PLUI IT TAKES O LIKE  TPER LIKE A DO LIKE  MAL
1048,GET IT WEIGHED AT LEAST IT WEIGHED TWO KILOGRAMS,ST ALLA LE  O CALLEGRAMS
1049,WELL IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING LIQUID GRAMS WEIGHT,INZAION WILL WE N IS WE ALIKE  WIATH RA
1050,A GRAM IS ABOUT ONE RAISIN,GRAMTH IS ABOUTO
1051,UM EXCEPT FOR THE PLUNGER NOT REALLY,AEPATERS NOT RELY
1052,THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE METRIC SYSTEM,AT HASD ITHGITM
1053,UM NO,
1054,YEAH,YEL
1055,PRETTY GOOD,G
1056,TENS,
1057,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW HOW MANY UM,ASI S HE E
1058,I FEEL HOT AIR COMING OFF OF THIS VENT,I FIELL HAACM
1059,UH A FULL DIAPER WITH ALL OF WATER,IPER WITH ALL OWATOR
1060,YEAH AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY IT'D FILL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY MMM TWO HUNDRED,WEVE SOUGHT HOW MNEY AR  AND IT WAS E Z CLEATW HNDRD
1061,SO MMM HMM,SO
1062,HMM OKAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO,THST WHILL BE EBSTAMATED NUMBER EH NUMBER TOOK TW
1063,JUST A SEC YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NINE,I'M READY SURE T IS FIN
1064,NOT A LITTLE WHILE JUST PRETTY BY YEAH,S NOT OLPRY CLOATSHE
1065,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME,ITMAD ME THINK THE YARD STICK ABECUSAR ALWAYS THE SAME
1066,MMM HMM N MMM,ABMAL
1067,WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER,THE FIRST THING WED WASSWE WENTROWND THE RM TRYING TO FIND SOMTHING   MATOR
1068,EH A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS UP AND DOWN,H HDRDDMATORPU E BEL A OPEN DOWN
1069,PROBABLY THIS OF CENTIMETER,ROATO
1070,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH,I WAS LIKE O MENEY STROAW SIGES OF YOUR DET THREA
1071,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAW ON THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAD TO TAPE THEM E TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER,IT WASRD BECAUS WE HADT A DRO ON THE OMS I MEN NOT DRWE HAD A CAUM TO GATHER IN THE RIN ORER ELO THE SAME
1072,YOU HAVE HAVE TO ESTIMATE HOW BIG YOU ARE,ME HO I  WA
1073,ES YES WE HAVE,WE HAVE
1074,NO WE HAVEN'T USED IT YET,WEHAVE A NI YET
1075,YEAH WE MADE OUR METER TAPE,HILL WE MEAT ON MATOR
1076,A CENTIMETER IS TEN METERS,OUR SENT MATOR TENH MATORS
1077,MMM HMM I WONDER WHERE THAT YELLOW BALL WENT OKAY,I WONDER WH THE YELOW BALMAND
1078,OH YEAH,GROUNL
1079,THERE WERE TEN YEAH,TA RCHEN
1080,EVERY TEN WE COLORED IT A DIFFERENT COLOR,EVERY TEN WECIS A DIFRENT CAR
1081,WHAT WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANSWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE Y WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU G IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,OU LKYOUR LEG  TRIDS EVERY THING THE GETS THE ASER GO ON  GEBECAUS I YOU DON'T GETF YOU D
1082,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING,H SRPRISE ME ABOUT TH THA  WAS EXSPECTING TO BEOREVERYTHING
1083,BUT USUALLY THEY HAVE LIKE MEASURING TAPES THERE,UHAVASANCA
1084,WHAT KINDA THINGS DID I ESTIMATE,I'M COM TO THINK
1085,OH YEAH IT WAS THE STRAW ONE,WAS THE STRAUMA
1086,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,M ME REALIS AR CABLE OTHER GLASTHEOTHER TABLES M DFNSS
1087,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,BECAUSE BERD CAN ET STARI MONP
1088,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WHLL THE ESTAMMATING LIKE THE EBSTAMATING WISSTOMATI GURONRFLE IINS LIKE A GFSE
1089,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,W SUPSERING TO HELP USLASS
1090,E IT NO I DON'T REMEMBER,DON'TRMAMBER
1091,A HAN B A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TWENTY CENTIMETERS,HADS A HANDW NOT A MEATERBU
1092,YEAH,HWA
1093,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A ME THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN A METER SORRY,TENR TEMPS
1094,NO EVERY TEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,EVERY TEN THE IS A DIFRENT CULLAR
1095,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES,WHY THAT IS IS BECAUS YO WILN'T GET ONE STAGERDMONT
1096,NO,
1097,YEAH,
1098,YEAH YARD STICK IS JUST LIKE THAT BIG AND YEAH,THE YARD STINKE IS JUST LIKE THAT BIG
1099,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT,WE'VE HAD SRA
1100,WE WE IN TODAY'S MATH STUMPER WE WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS L ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS,IN TOA MA STMAHY THE NOUMBERS RDYI WAS SEVENIT WAST ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE IN THE
1101,NO BOTH WAYS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETER OH NOT THE PERIMETER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YEAH YEAH,NYINEG WITH THREE THE OTHER WODS FORI THE OTHER WO D GS ATWAYDON'T LENGTH YET
1102,HOW MANY CENTIMETERS JUST A SEC A HUNDRED,I HON  MATEORSJU
1103,WELL H H I WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG,UIF YOUR  ING NEVER RALLYI YOUR BA ETHTM ALLYVR
1104,WELL WELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS,WITHWEWI LIKE ING ATEORS A EV MATOEORS IN EVRY THING WITH MATOR TEMELATOATORS
1105,YEAH,
1106,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS,CAMITHDIFRENT ACERES BECAUS THE DIFRNT

1119,TWO,TWO
1120,TEN,
1121,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,HIS THE LEG BETWEEN TOIONS DON'T OL  R
1122,IS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT,BECAUS YOU GAS STAWITIGTHE EROP IS THE SAMEAS YOUR WATCH IN YOUR PANTLES
1123,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REAL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTOR'S USE YEAH,THE WATER YET STDYWES WE HAD A PLUSSHER ON DOL
1124,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,D I LIKE EST ABOUTGING PLAYD WITH WATER
1125,THAT IT TAKE UP YEAH IT'S LIKE GALLONS,ATS LIKE CALLONTS
1126,MAYBE A HUNDRED,IND
1127,A HUNDRED,AHONDERAD
1128,A HUN TEN,TEN
1129,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE WILRING HCH ISOUR TEN GRU WAS ON LEADER
1130,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S ABOUT IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK,TUSABOUTA ST EVERY BODY HAS THE SAM
1131,THESE TWO AND THESE TWO ARE THE SAME,ZEI  THE SAME

1163,AND WE SQUIRT SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS ARE LIKE THAT BIG,WILL YOU SEE HOW MONY VAOLLES PUERD FIELL ST LIKE TH US IT WAS ONLY T
1164,IS TEN,T
1165,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,OL ALWAYS TS A PURFIT MATMONTAS
1166,TEN OR MAYBE MORE YEAH,N
1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,TURMWATER
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WD YOU INCSARP PICKEDUP THEAR WASHESE
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,YOU CROSMLGS HA
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,APATHETIC
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,THE MR OPE ARON THEL TICIGTS
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IS A CLOSARON THE WASHERI OPENSERT
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,VENFOU PICXEDUP THREEOOF
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,R JUST SR I RAP  AATER A ROWND
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,J TATCHED T THURNTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WHI PUT A  PICKE OUP FIFTYEN MASES BE FOURTHE ONLY PIGTUB TSME SHE IS IN SRD FIFTYEN ASES TO THT AERALA
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,HSWHIS ROUP AROUND
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,CRE OER PIC UP THE LOTEAS ARUP THE DIRT PIDTPU TNDEDPIUP T H
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,ORLAT
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,E  SIRCME IN THE OPEN CIRCUSSEVRYTN
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,S ALLBO H  SWITH VR WAGGVS
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,D ACOLOR
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,AD  BATHER FASING POSET O NEG
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,OU HAVE ANS HAPEN THI STRIG GETING  FORTO
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,U OU SING A BUTTERBOTHE GRAFFS
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WEL HAP ON THE OTER AD AET AN NOTHER PAT
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,AR AS AL THRVISIONDCA WATER
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,RDR DESCUVERY IS THE CUSION WIS NOW
1189,NO,IV
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IS JUST LOUDE THR BECAUSEEVERY SUR TURNS HA GROUNDY
1191,UM IT WILL <unk> IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,AOSCARDOD THE BEL ZUSION IS  AM RAUD
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS <unk> RIGHT,BECOMSE JUST HA ONTHE A  OUTDRY SIRC INSIDE THE SHORTPA
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,GOING ON THE IK  CIRCUS ISTHE WIS ARTH CONECTEDION
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,RRES VAT THE
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THALL BE OECTEDG
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,RVS YOU JUST PUT OE BEATER IN PU THO LIF YOU HAD TWO BATHEREASA
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT STEL ME THA AL TOY FLOWS  U MATER TH RO
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,THEARTHS EMPR BECAUS IM ELETRIT AGOLES
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,CIRSBOUTLEC GOING TH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THEAR IS EATHER THREEO O  PATHWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,NB CINDS OF CIRCUSINMYOATS
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK MARBLE   RIF YOU CAN LIKE A BAUTTER  BATTER
1203,OKAY,GR
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT <unk>,O THI  INAGY  WILL
1205,FINISH,PUNISH
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,OFRYPEOPLE
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,TH OG   YOURGANSARA TO MUCH
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINKAS WTE CONECTED I  THECASON
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,WHEN WE HAD MARBLE THLI GETS WIKER
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ISRE IS CRPE BECAUS U TH

1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,UB HORIS
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE R A STRAWN
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,ADA DOES NT MIXR
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,ASTOPA
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THEN FORCIONF THE MA AXPLASOURED VTABLS TVMCH
1249,THE MAGNET <unk> THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,MAGATMAGAIS UNDERD THE STOCKS AND YOUR JUSPEDD
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,THER  SIDE WHEN H WASHR ETS BECASBECASE THE A
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THEL SPISION MAKE  OH HA LGR
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,APENT WASH I
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,ZEVAN URI OPEAZEAR BRAESIS TFOLI THAT BECAUS  T
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,ADAR TOSRT MAK TO A ATER  THEHEPIT MAK EVON
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,OSIDAS OAH
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WATER S IN  COP INMNATS ANDOTHERSEMAGNTSL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,GRAMSFOTHUMORSE
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,THE OTHERMAR IS NOT CON ECTED  TW TH WIHA MEAGEAR
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,HE SIN AAT

1261,MAGNETISM,MATHNE
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,I GOOTH PRASPEATERSXTHE
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,BECAUS IAGOWIS MALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,MAKBW CANS STRONA Y RELLYHIANT
1265,I NEEDED THREE,DAED THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,RYI NOT LAS ONSPSR GOLD
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT SAVERE BECAUS IT LOGAR II HAS  FOPELLIP BY IT SELF IF YOU TOAKE OFF THOUR MABPNEAT AND IS HAVE TH AO MMEY THAT CAI B CING MAGNETVE
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,A IS VERU SOMTHING MET UN STICKS TOOK RAA BECUS
1269,<unk> THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,
1270,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,BAL  ONAARY HAS O PEOPLES OSTIC
1271,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,SIXPEOPLEUR LE CAN NOHT GO THROO BECASS THIXK
1272,BUT THE DIFFERENT <unk> PUSH BACK,PUT THE DIREN HORSES IN PUSH BAK
1273,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,THAR RELLA E AOS IS AVE ON MANTGHROO
1274,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,GER ISOUPA WITH A  SIN VAN
1275,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,HEBILD A MANOS REACTM HAVING THA HO SARSAR STROUG HOLDF PEPLE
1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,BRD CAN SEVABOUT THET IS MACHNATS ORE AC
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ATIN LIKE A B  ROPERON I LT WNG GET STICKHING LIKE A M
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,MAO ORA STIC
1279,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHIS   MILT SHOLDER  GLE
1280,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LURG A MAGMATTISOM
1281,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,BECAUSE RMAGMATISOME CAN OTEROLIS
1282,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GO TO MI G LAST
1283,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,ARYBECAS AL DOS SAMG ING WITH FMAGMEN
1284,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,TO OPENHE IS STICN T NR
1285,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,W DYOU MEANI THE SAME PICTURE
1286,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,WHEN SHDI ABOUT  GO POPLESTICKSS BECUS
1287,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,HAPN THED STARKO BECAUSE THE  HORSESLIKESTRANG
1288,REPEAT THAT,R
1289,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAR FROM TH BLU

1879,THAT'S WEIRD LOOKING,PATH EHERD L
1880,MMM HMM LIKE UM WE HAVE RUBBER BANDS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA DO LIKE THREE RUBBER BANDS AND THEY THINK THAT IT'LL BE IN LESS LINES FOR THE PROPELLER,WE HAVE A BINS AOND SOM PEPLE OU LIKE THREE RUBEMIDS
1881,SORRY WHAT,STARGI
1882,MAYBE IT'S CAUSE YOU WOULD GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER LIKE IF YOU DID MASS WAIT IF YOU DID LIKE RUBBER BANDS AND FORCE FOR THE FAN MAYBE IT YOU WOULDN'T GET THE SAME ANSWER AS YOU WOULD JU FOR JUST THE FAN OR JUST THE RUBBER BANDS,MABECAUS HE WILLGAER YOU DIF YOU LIKE EAMSTAMD ORS FO TH ADMABE WILG THE SAME ANRSWJUTA
1883,UM WE'VE BEEN JUST LIKE A LOT TIMES WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES HALFWAY AND HOW FAR IT GOES ALL THE WAY AND WITHOUT IT LIKE WE DID LIKE EIGHTY TWO AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY BUT IT THEN IT BOUNCED OFF THE CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THEN WE TRIED SIXTY AND THAT HAD A LITTLE BOUNCE AND THEN WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND THAT WAS PERFECT IT LIKE STOPPED RIGHT AT THE CHAIR,WE'VE BIN JUSTA LOGOF TIM WNGHOI WE DID LIKE  O BONSTOPH THE CHAR O TH THERS EVEN TRM SIXT A ILE BONS FIFTHE CHAR
1884,YEAH UM WE LIKE HOW WE MADE IT WE TOOK UM FISHING LINE THE REALLY STRONG STUFF AND UM WE DUCT TAPED IT TO A CHAIR OF FOUR METERS AND THEN WE TAPED IT TO ANOTHER CHAIR AND THEN WE ATTACHED OUR PLANE UM TO THE FISHING LINE AND UM OUR PLANE IS MADE OUT OF STRAWS LIKE DRINKING STRAWS UM AND RUBBER BANDS AND UH POPSICLE STICKS AND WHEN WE WIND IT UP UM MY GROUP ENDE MY GROUP AND I WE GOT SIXTY AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY LIKE IT GOES BY ITSELF WITHOUT US T T TOUCHING IT OTHER THAN WINDING IT AND THE IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CHAIR,WELWE TOOK A FISHING INE THERLY SAD WEDU T TO A CHAR  FOUR MEATORS A T TO AN NOTHER CHAR A WE A TATCH AR PLAYINGTISHING N  YR PLANE IS ADS LKE DRIM R VS ANDI  EDMY GOUT SIXTL GOS BI IT SEL WITHOT AET
1885,LIKE WE WE HAD TO DO WE HA WE GUESSED LIKE FOR MAYBE IF YOU HAVE FIFTEEN AND THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE IT JUST STAYED IN IT'S PLACE SO ONE REALLY BIG VARIABLE IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER FOR THE PLANE,WE HAD A WE FIFTEN ON RILLY BIG VEROBL ISV M YOUAR  THE P
1886,TO IF EVERYONE WAS DOING LIKE THE SAME VARIABLE IT WOULD TAKE A LONGER TIME TO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF EVERYBODY DID THE SAME VARIABLE AND THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES SO I GUESS IT'S UH,IFEVERY ONE IS TOING THE SAME VG ALOG TIMET IXSPEVERYBODTHE SAME
1887,THEN WE WIND IT UP AND WE TEST ALL OF OUR VARIABLES,HE WAGEDT UP  THE TST
1888,CAUSE THAT WILL EVERYBODY WANTS A DIFFERENT ANSWER,CEVERY BOEY LIE A IFN ANAR
1889,YEAH WE GET FISHING LINE AND WE DECK LIKE WE GET A PIECE OF DUCT TAPE AND WE LIKE PUT IT RIGHT HERE AND IT'S LIKE UM IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE CHAIRS TOGETHER IT SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE VERY SPREAD APART SO IT'S LIKE REALLY TIGHT AND THEN WE PUT OUR PLANE ON RIGHT UM RIGHT BEFORE WE PUT ON THE DUCT TAPE AND WE UM,FISHINGNMIT SHOULD BE LIKE CARRES TO GETHERIT SHOLD  BE VERY S STOSIHEN WE PUT AUR PLAYNS OL RI AL RIE FOURE WE PUT ON THE DGA
1890,LIKE,WHITE
1891,LIKE IF EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME ANSWER IT MIGHT'VE TAKEN A LONGER TIME TO TEST OUT THIS EXPERIMENT,IF EVERY BODY COUGH THE SAME ANCERNT AKIN A LROGPENT
1892,UH MMM CAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO ONE AT A TIME MMM A CA AND UH EACH TABLE GROUP IS A DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KINDA COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY THAT,BCAUS I THINK ARGON WI AND I EATCH TABLE GROS DFREN VEOBLES CID
1893,WELL IF YOU LIKE DO IT I GUESS IF YOU KIND OF TODAY UH WE'RE GONNA DO IT OUTSIDE UM,IF YOU LIKE TO ATIF YOU CID TO NA H BRGAN

1896,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHAIRS AND DUCT TAPED EM AND OUR WE WINED UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WAIT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASS ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES,WE'VE BEN M GETING IWE'VE GOUGHT ION FIST FLYIN CHARES  DAR WE WIMPEDUP THE PLAYNE WIT PRPATS IN RAA ADR THE ERBLES WE FOUT DOUTIS THE O OR N FAST THE PLAN GOAS
1897,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN,WHEN WE GOUGHT HAF AY WE DID THE SAME NOMER WE THOGHT  S WE HAD O CP DRYING ONLCOD JUST IGRTE NERTE
1898,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO AT THE TOP OF THE POD AND THEN ARE GONNA GO DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF GOING DOWN LIKE UM MAYBE LIKE IN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING IS AT,SOM PEOPLE I LIKE T SLOPEOM PEOPLE GO I THE TOP OF THE PA ARGO DOSTRAT SWEAR THE T CHARSWI THEY THINK THAT THEAT CAN GOUMY APINIONTHIRDOWNTHER
1899,N MMM AS LONG IT'S AS LONG A IT'S THE STRING IS TIGHT AND THE PLANE IS ON MMM HMM,AOI I THE STRENG IS TY ANDTHE PLA IS OD
1900,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE A TWENTY MAYBE LIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP,LISPECTINGT TOA LL  BI TWL FOTHSERTHE AMD IS HELPNG  PUSH
1901,BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP,ARE YOU TH LIKE WAA
1902,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,AST YOU TS
1903,YEAH,
1904,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,L BECAUS WE HAD TO FINGER OUT WAS HAFH LAY FOR THE PLAYINGOTO S THE SPANTESEERGOSHEA
1905,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,SOFR WE'VE TSTED LIKE A TO LIKE AFAY IN AL THE ASOMTIMS WE STARCHEDTHE PLANOS ASIO
1906,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,OOL HAE O DOIF IT WAS LUIRWEWE HAD A STREING VERY TITWHEN WEL FIFT THE STREN S VYT LRWE MIHT  HAVE A SPI FER
1907,SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE,SIR GESID G DIFRN ANSERT FOR YUCH WONE
1908,YEAH,Y
1909,WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY THOUGH,ORGANIZ
1910,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,I SE I WAS GOING ON T THREE WA TE Y I
1911,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,LEER CHESING ONE VERRABLE TR TE SR D MAUR GROEST HGERWITH BEING SIXYE SPIONS A ROUND
1912,A SANDWICH,SAVG
1913,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WOL LIKE MY GR R IN FRONDF ME THE DID I ONE M MEAER WEVE TD FIVE R A E WITH COMPR
1914,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YEWE DINT THAT CAA GOD EBLWEARE THE THREE INCHES AR TW RTH WE TWO THREE  FIVE INTO FIVE RE NI FIVE  OP THE CUB FIVE O PASONGERSTHE HNE ISOUR IS YOU GT OR PASN GERE D ON INTI R
1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,CAS FOR AL AL TH  O RESON A JUSTGOING LEAING  SD WE DIDN'T REALLY YFOR ALF THE IT WE RD PUINGIN THEIDLWEVE AUG ABOUT TWENTY TO PASONGERS INTH THREE EVORE OUT TWENTY SIX IN THEFIVE INO
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,OO HA THE TARYOU A THE LIFE BOATS ARE CUTETHE CAN HOLDA OUR PASSONDERES  RAGLERSTHAT WAS K
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M GOUING WITHVEONDERING WHY IT GOWS TO THE STRPN
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WIL THIS ON HOLDS FR
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T REALLY RMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,IFIL LIKE A SUPER STARI AR RADY NETHT
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,EVE JUST A FEU PANTS AR ON THE SD SEARCH GSDHAS  V A CHANTS TO STAY UP WITHTH PASSONDERSA EACLLAONDIFRENT PARTS  EAL
1922,YEAH,
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,AR  A PR TICLE  I OF  CRUSH THEING  A HE FIGER DOWMY CAWBOTS  TE R IT  THE IT WTVER THE A
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,THEE AD A E ATR N WE HAD  DME   HE FIFTHREE FOR THE FIVE WE G HE GOUT FIFTY THREEO ONTHREE
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,S E  LIFE UT LIFYD WE TOOK A PANSHRROTHE DICTONSTARTED U TO THE DTHE WE PUT IT IN YAR WATTERTHE WE PLEISED THA PANEAS WEV WE WETE  THOUGTTHT IF WE  A ONE SID ASTER
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,WE ET  ALBARTS FORUS
1927,THE HEIGHT,
1928,MAYBE,MAB
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,ICLE ASS HOW MUCHT CAN HOLD
1930,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE,I WASN'T HA YESTERDAY TOLD YOU SI THE DED SAN
1931,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,WE JUSTPLAYSED HAPANEYS IN AL DIFRNT COURTERS
1932,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,G PEL MEAT LIKE LIFE BOATS PRSON RESON I THEIRIS I LIKE THE BT CRASHISR SOM RESONS PEOPLEH PANY THERW REL PASONDGERES ITHE  WI B SE TAS BIGR
1933,YEAH,
1934,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,FOTHE THREEWEVADU WATERFIVE  PU PWHE WE HAD A SCRAGUM WEAD  SC GUM WE HAD  STIR UP ALL THET WATER SOS E TREEELEPONT WE PUT IT IN A S

1939,ONE MORE TIME,
1940,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,D WIE ORTT ROJ STIKED IN THE COURNER AND STARTED SA AS
1941,IS THIS THING ON RIGHT,O
1942,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,I THINK THE SERINIS THA IF YOUR HAVES T PANEE RED OLASH LK
1943,FIVE INCHES,FIVENJUS
1944,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN,I BAIRO LIKE SOMTHING I CAN HAO MY SOFTIEN
1945,I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER,TE HIGHER WON SNG FASTER
1946,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT,EVERY BODY MAS THE WE COULDN'T E LIKE THE OLD CAROTABSEVERY BODY JUSTSTI THER ON ITT FIVEOFFS HESOME PEOPLE O
1947,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT IS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES,THI ON HOLDS MY WATER S II ALSO DS OUR PANS WATER ALSO D  PANS
1948,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MMM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBE TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK,ONLY ON THE MELO LEADERS AS THE THRE ISEN SIX DALN  PSTIGUP TO FIFTYDRIT S OVER FIFTY  OURDOUT WE GOUH ONE HONDRED THMELADERS FOR WE ONLY FIFTY
1949,W WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THAT MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE,ET MY PARNERI ALSO YY PURNERI LO TRYNG TO PUT THE PANEI FR PLAYSING IT IN THE WATTER SV SIXASER PLAYSE FIT IN THE WATTER STARTED
1950,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UH ONE TO FIVE INCHES THAT YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND,HLING CROST ME LIKE A CUBS OF WATERCOFCPS WATER DOSN ONE FIVE I YOU C  THREVN PASONGERSPASONDERS
1951,WE THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TWO Y WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND,E O FOOT STICXS   WTHE A O LOVERTH AD O LOVEL ME IN MY CA

1959,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER,TH LENGH THE STRING CHANGES THE OLE PROSSESPUTE MAS IN THE BEGINING OF WILLY START THE B DOES NOT MATER
1960,YEAH,
1961,MMM HMM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER E WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE,FOR THE THERTEVERY BONE GOUT THE SAME WITH THE SAME MAST ITH THE SAME LENG WHEN EVERY BONEY STARTED  CHAG NUMBERLTART
1962,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YO WIL FIND YOUR LENGHBCAS EVERY BODY CAUGHT THER AWL T FIVE YOURS SILVER
1963,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHITE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO BY ONE BY ONE UM WITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE,E OUNG THE MOPH ON A SHRTO AR LIBOARD A WA LIKEWSKTW THREE FOR TETY FIVETEVE PEOPLE JUST STARTED ONE BI ONE   NINE  BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE YS T MY L EAR

1967,YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET SEVENTEEN,SEVEN TE
1968,YEAH,YEOW
1969,WELL W WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON A STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY UH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIOUS OF TIMES,WE TESTED WITH A THERPNM STRIGAND EVERY BODY JUST THER EVERY BOYD NMER OFWLVERMS
1970,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WWE DID TRY I THINK TWO DS EVERODDTE GIVE OH PANSDTT DIDN'T SEA CHANG
1971,CAN I HEAR MYS,
1972,AND THEN,
1973,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS,WYR SEL ING TH EVERY BODY IS BE SIDEI THE RASETH W ESISIONISSTHAT DOESN'T MATER LENGH FTER
1974,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TWO I THINK THREE FOUR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LINE DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND UH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE,THESG MYI SOL MY  ON THE BORD  LIME DOWN  SIRCU WE ALL WIS CMPADRSB TWO HONDERED FIFTEN   L O THE

2000,UM YES BUT UM OUR TEACHER HAD US COUNT ALL TOGETHER LIKE LIKE I HAVE SHOWN YOU THE WHOLE CYCLE,YES AR TEATIR HAS A COWT ALL T GETHER O
2001,YES,ES
2002,THAT WELL THE TWO HUN AND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KINDA JUST GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING,B TWO HD FIFTE WITH STAGL RO YH NINE I G
2003,SAY THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE AND THEN FOR TWO FIFTEEN I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD PROBABLY END UP,T AD TENT FOR YOR TWO FIF TN I'L ET UN OPE AE DOMA
2004,I GUESS IT IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TWO OR ONE TWO THREE FOUR THE THE WHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE,IEAVE EVERY BONEY WIL JOT G  THE OD THING WIDLN'T BE
2005,YEAH LIKE IF IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE WAIT IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I JUST DID ONE TWO UM THEN THE LONGER STRING WOULD MOST LIKELY GET UM THE MOST AMOUNT,AIK IF THE LONGR STREEN DI E T R   A UTN THE LONGREM WS MOST LIKELY GETA THEMOSTOUNCE
2006,CAN I HEAR MY,
2007,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,I LIKE FOURTY SEVEN MEATERS WILL DEHN T CHANGBT TENN TWETY TH LIKE FOURTETM A UDE DIFPRN
2008,YEAH,YEL
2009,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,WE HAD  WE HADWE HAD D FOURRENTER RSTWEN E FOUR SIX EME MEATORS VERY CLOHE THET FIVE Z  FOURTHREE
2010,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,TOCO ARIK ANOD D I HAV STOF PLAYNGS LIKE A CAO THR AEXSPERIMENTNGTTHIS OBJECT WIT PLING I O SIRIL ZAR
2011,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,WE O TWO VERBLESBT CUMINGT ETHE ONEUL SING CA AR IN YOUR E STICKSA H VEGET ABL
2012,CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET YOUR RESULT,BCAUSTHATS ONLY WY
2013,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,MY TEATER JUST O STTMERWHEN WE STARTED UPE SIX ER WE TWETY SEVEN MDERF WE TWENTYAPE MY MATHIS HO FARE THE STACES IN R
2014,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,ARICOBSTX IN SIXEMATORS THE WO  LKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FV SIX
2015,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAD ARATRAS RE ZOLT SEVEN  TEN ALEVEN T THERT TEONE WO THREE FOUR FIVE YOU WILL DE VIDE
2016,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,LIK AT WE HAVE STICK GO O SICX  MEATER A TLEAND OUR PUING R O LIK WE A CROUSHIN T IN TO A BOI  EEI GT IN TO A BOI MY CAGES  VELVRAND SOM PEOPLE AR DEN AR BOLGOS SOM PEOPLE AR D HO  BOLGO IN SOM PEOPLE U HO AR THE STICKYSI SOM PEOPLERS SO
2017,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,THETHE BOGTEM A SOMTIM WN ABOUT A HONDERED N FIFTY SEVEN MATOR W IS  LMENTVRING
2018,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,SAALDGER WI TESTINGTHE FOUR ALBADIS LIKE TH  AO IT ISOTHE FOUR
2019,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVEN EEN ADOS ALL T GETHERM GET YOUR ANDZAR ZEONE SEVEN FIVEST ONE THERPT ONE FIF TEPT ONE SEVEN DE
2020,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,TRYING  M AORWVER YOU DVEDRI'M NOT SUREBOUT THES CURPL THINKING AFT THESHEWLLD EK COLATERS SO AFTER THE DESTL ON THE COLATERSIRMI ATHEDS
2021,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEOPLE COS TINK HOW AR THE ILUMONO BOL GOS LI NAR DITANTSI GEIR RENTBILL SRTMBECAUS WE HAVE O IRND  I U
2022,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,MYGR I TOOK A SMOLL LLUM  BOL OF TS CRUWE TOOK A NOTHER POP STICSF  DID W  FINGER MY T NOT GO S  VEBLE R Y STACLE
2023,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOUR E  OR SIXWE DID FOUR TIMES AT WEVATEDV FOUR CAUS WE DIDN'T FOTISEZALTS
2024,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,A AFIVE IN TH PERSON HO HETHE WULD P THER HADS E G SIRA W ONE THERTYE ON FIFTEEN NEXT N SEVEN FIVE NEXT
2025,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,LBERD TOALKING ABOUT THE  THEIM LUFUL GLIKE THOS GIRLES ON THEARTHE IS AN AN SEE HA ITS OPEN DOWNTHAT HEO

2418,UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER,I'M OT TIGHT  EMBER
2419,I KNOW THAT UM CIRCUITS IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF THE LIGHT IN ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF,SCIRCUS IS WITTE MIE PS AN A HOS S IS IS NOTA PARLLSIR BECAUSW OFF
2420,WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF,CIRCUSIS AIRNIBRO CIRCUSTHYA TLSTOFF
2421,OK BYE,APUY
2422,I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF,I THINKA SW IF YOU TAKE ON OL THE OTHERTOFF
2423,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON UNTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE,I THINK HING LIKE THATCUSIF YOULL THE RW GOOUTTURN BA YOU
2424,I THINK IT COULD BE BOTH ACTUALLY,I THINK IT CAN BE ACTLY
2425,THIS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO,EON HAS ON THE OTHER TWO
2426,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BY TO OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT,SIRI THINK IS PRUTY MUCH THE SAME A THELI CLOSE TO ECHOATHERTHE WRAR TESAIFNT
2427,YES,YES
2428,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH,THE OTHERTERT PASTHWAYS FOR THE BATE F UNER BUIN ONLY ONE PATHWAYTEIRS  A SORG THE OTHER SIDIT CAN'T
2429,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL ST,ISBECUSPARBLOSWEN YOU TAK OFF YOU TURN OPTHETHE   YTNNL THE THER
2430,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT,THE WAYERES LOKED THE SAYMETHE BATTER LOOKED A LIL DIFRN
2431,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE,I SEEAONEL PAR OF LOBS IS BRIGTER THEN THE OTHER ONE EAR TWO DIFRENT CIRCUSBELEF
2432,GOOD,GOD
2433,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK,I THINKTHE WAGTER WAS IN THERIF THERT WIS ONLY A LIL MAH T LIL E
2434,NOT YET,NOTYET
2435,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY,TISO I THINKISTE N WA IF YOU TURN OLPC NOT T OTHER WAERES TUCHNG THE BATTERY TOO OTHERS TUCHNG THE LU
2436,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO FLOW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE,ONE ONLY ONEPATHWAYE BECASFOUR AR TERIS ONLY WONE PATHY THRO FROM ZERO TO THE OTHER
2437,MABE I'M NOT REALLY SURE,MAINO REALY SURE
2438,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON,W TOLKING ABOUT WER ATHRAEI THINK THIS IS THE OTHER WRE  PATH RAEIF YOU TOOK OUT THE F WN WD SG
2439,THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON,MOR THN ONSIRCUI THINKCAUS ONEP W YOU TAKE OFF ON THE OTHER  GOSTEYOU  TAKE OFF AL THE OTHER WENSL GOWS
2440,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF,WE'VE BEN WALING ON PARLEL IN OTHER CIRCUS ISI CTH
2441,UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH,THE OTHER STAS ON BECAUS THEIRS STILT A PATHWAY FOR THE UNER LOW THROT
2442,WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH,THE WA PATH HIY WAYFO THE ENERGYO GO THROTHE WAR WAS INTEE NARGY GO THRO
2443,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THING'S THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB,I THINK IT TELS ME THATIL THINKSEATE THINGS  SURROUND G AR THE RS  G THINGS WITH  LL ISINARE
2444,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE,I THINKTATIS BECAUS IS NOGT A A MINE D WERCAUSTHAT WILL BE ARTER FOR THE ENEARGYTO GET THRO JUST STRC WAER
2445,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS THE SAME UM AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY,I THINK THIS  IS  THE SAMES THE OTHER O ER OON ON OUCHBAERY
2446,YES,YES
2447,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB,IT MA B CAMING FROM THTR BECMING SRL BAK UNTO THE BATTERY
2448,YES,
2449,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KINDA THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP,THE ILLECTIY AS FNPLASEG THGN LOKES LIK A SPRING STUDIO
2450,YEP,YELLOW
2451,WELL WHAT YOU DO WOULD YOU WRAP IT A KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THEN ANOTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOULD TURN ON,YOU A CIND OF MIK A SCIRCLE A ROWNDTHEBATER YOU PUTWITH BOTH THE WATERS YOU TUCH ONE M

2465,YES IT'S A CIRCUIT,IRCUS
2466,UM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT,YOU AVTO MAKE SURE THAT WSPRFICLY OTHER WISE W A IN THE RA PLAYSEAND STAY

2476,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,I DIDN'T LA WITH THE BLUE SING DIDN'T LOOK ITH RETIGTE RBU JUST
2477,INTO THE LIGHT BULB,A
2478,E PLACE WHERE,PLAYSEWAR
2479,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WLPB ABOUT RT IF WE COULD LIH THE
2480,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,DRO TH  STARTH GOSDBELUP IN THE ILLCTIS GFROMTH ITSADTI A FMATER WOAR JU
2481,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT,THSALL THINGW YOU PU
2482,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,THROW THELB TOSIDE AND GET STARTEDGSIDE UN TLL THE BATERY IS PUOP
2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,P YOU HAVE A MIXSTURE OF WATER N MARBLE YOU HTHE WATER WIL GO THR THE SREE MARBLESAR TOO BIG THT MIXTUR
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,LLTHE DIFRENT PARTS AR SEPERATING THEU ON PIEACH PIL ONLY HAS A LI SHAPE AND  TR
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,E MEK TOO DIFRENT THINGS TOGETHERTHMOD N WATER F INIL AR HAS A VERY OUTNTROL BECASTHE WATER DREENSPSE AR SEPERATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,IT BEGAN A STUDET CIS OF THINGS WHE YO MIXTDT TO GEATHERL BECAMETHE MIXSTURANDI NO DEZL INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE IS O THE R AR ALLTTH SAO T S ALLH DIFRNT CINDS MIXT TO GETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SREEM IS VERY IN BECAUS WATER CAN GO O THE SREEMMARBLE ARE TOO BIG ASATOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,COLD WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,MGOO
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,TS HAPENING HEAR IS ALLTH DIFRENT PARTS WOF TH MIXSTUR BECAS WE E YIOL IN STED TGETHERA MIXSTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,ELUSION
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,TDLERI PERPEUS IS T SEPERATFNT CINS OF MIXTJURWILE O THIP THE WATER RUSH DOWN A STAES TH BOUTTEMN THAASO F IS VE DIFRENT CINS  MIXTYURT CSTO

2499,THE SALT WILL WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,THY DESB IN TO THE WATER
2500,GOOD BYE,GDBY
2501,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE SOI ABEL O DE ZALVE INT WATERDWHEN IT IS FINISHEDI ITEV O CRASE THE WATER
2502,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFRENS BETWEEN MIXTURSONELUSION MIXTURS N NE FULE TINR MIXT  GETHER TBE SEPERATEDAD ELUSION  ULEN  NOT ABL TO BE SEPERATED
2503,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,SALLY HAS MAY THINGS MIXSTI ONA B OF DIFRN THINGS LI AER SANPERI  JELYA NORMAL MIXTURES
2504,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,IIS PRTN BECAUS HEN YOU MIX TOO THINKS TO GTHERE CN PUSHIT THRO LIKE A COFFTHE WATER WILL STAK THE BOLTEMTHE DMTING WILL SAYIN A COFFYDOWN
2505,THEY FLOAT,LOW
2506,THEY ARE ALL MIXTURES,THYARE MIXSTURES
2507,WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE'VE BEN DURING ALO EXPERMENTS ABOUT MIXTURNLUTIONS
2508,THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP,THE WATER SNGGBTM   MARBLESTINGTO
2509,IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE,HIS CARD MIXSTURE
2510,I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE,I THINK WE BECAS EVERY THING CAN BE SEPERATED FROM ILLUSION  MIXSTURE
2511,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,ALL THE DIFRNT CINDS OF THINGS THE CHA KEEPERATBEIS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2512,EVAPORATION,VOPERATION
2513,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE CONTEMPRATION OF ILLUSIONETHER ATIGOR AKNG AWAY
2514,THEY'RE MORE DILUTED,THEY ARE MO DIELUTEDS
2515,SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER,VILLUSION  TWO FO THINGS MIXT TOGEATHER
2516,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT,THE DRCLRD IELUSIONSM WITH LES CALLAR AV LEST CGRAPEDS
2517,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY FULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE FANTASTIC,YOU DIDN'N'T  TASTE VEY VEYWETIDE SALUR  VY VY VEYPLEIIS ITH THE GRAAS
2518,UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM,HAVE MIXTURES I SILLUTIONS N LUNN H  SEPERATETH
2519,WELL TODAY WE USED UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CAN'T,A W YUSED WAT IN OREIXSPERMENT WE AL SO YOUSE TAST AND WE AL SO YOUSED
2520,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UM PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE,N WITH  GRATE HAS LITL TINE L DTAN SIRS O WITHA PURPLENWITH  PERPLE SOENIT HAS  CUTES A PEURPLETHEN THE OTHER ONAS LE UTSFPURPLE
2521,THE SOLVENT,SORVEN
2522,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE,NE MIXSTUR WITH ORPOUTER AT R SWEET ANDLY SAOUR COMPARED T ONE WITH ONLYA CUPL  GRAIVES
2523,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LESS IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX,MIXSTUR HAS FIFTY MELO MATORS OF WATERTHE FERST ONE WIISD HAS FIVE SPOONS FULLW LAST ON LY ONE SPOONFLEAA PART O THE DNMAE
2524,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNI FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAN ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WON'T,THER MN BIRSTS YOU CAN TEL E CASESKEN YOU CAN TEH LOOKAR YOU CAN OLS
2525,WEIGHT TASTE AND COLOR,WASETASTND COULLUR
2526,ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS,WOL HAS MOUR POUTER IN WOMEHAS LAST
2527,WE CAN ADD MORE WATER,WE CAN HAB MOR WATER
2528,A MIXTURE,MISTURE
2529,BYE MARNI IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO LATER,BUYING UR ES REALLY GOOD THALKING YOU T
2530,I'M GOOD,I'MGOOD
2531,I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE STUFF,I CAN TELL BI LOOKING A THE DIRR COLERD THAYHAV FOUR STF PURPLE
2532,IT WOULD TASTE LESS FLAVORFUL AND GRAPE,WI TAST FLAVELENGRA
2533,IT IS MORE DILUTED,IS AR DILUTED
2534,I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRIEND ON CRUTCHES,I'M GOODITHYB
2535,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE,ABLL HAS SEVEN FIVE MILLEADERSOF WATERHAS TEN GRAMSVOLYUM IN ANOTHER AS TWENTY GRAUM
2536,ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM,ONETHEME HAS GRAT MICX ONETHEME HAS A WATER ELUSIONWON
2537,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A THINGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD UM YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE,YOU CAN DUU MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A LITLE RAN AANDAPERATEPUTTHEM THRO A ELTER IND E STOPA
2538,ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS,ONE HAS MOR SOLUD EN WONE HAS LASST
2539,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE,ICL YO TH SO WATERIONYOU DOU NOT NOT THE DIFRENS BETWEEN AR THREE GLASSESPRP
2540,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY ONES YOU CAN'T SEE,E'VE BEN MARKING ON XTRIOILLUSIONSHAD A
2541,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SORRY WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR,YOUPUT THE ROCK IN YOU PUT A FEATHER IN LITER T NORMALAYO PUT THE ROCKA HEVIER TH YOU TKA FEATHER IS HEVIAGT
2542,YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,YOU CAN  ILLUSION IS CONCANTRATED WHE
2543,UH ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED T EST CONCNTRATED E THREE IN THE MIDLE
2544,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER,A FEATHER WAS T GRA I THE ROKI NIN MYOU PUTAA FEATHER IS LITER THE ROCKVR
2545,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE,BECAUSONE HAS FOR VOL YUD ONE HAS V U THAY BOLT HAVS SEVEN FIVE LERSATERHAS R IT WILL NAROLY
2546,YOU COULD TELL HOW CONCENTRATED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER,YOU CANH CR THE  CLRAHE ATO HAS A LA UDER IS LATER PTER
2547,BYE MARNI IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE BYE,BUYING MY NEA WAS REALLY GOOD THALKING TO YOU T
2548,YES,YES
2549,I DON'T KNOW,PNOI DON'T NOW
2550,BY DOING GRAM ADDING,BUYIG THE IGR BET O GRAND
2551,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS,IF MY PREDICTION WIT COT WITH TWENTY GRAMS WITH MOR ON WITH EN GRAMS
2552,I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED,I THINK MOST CONNR O IS ALEEST CONCNTRATED
2553,ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,ONE IS THE LIEST CONCENRATEDTWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED THREE I TH MIDLE
2554,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS,I THINK AN WITH NY GRAMP WILL WA AR BECAUSE IT HAS
2555,TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS AGAIN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS THAT'S WHAT THIS PICTURE SHOWS I'M DONE,SANT GRAM PUS TWENTY MS PUS TWENTY GMON EACLE FIFTY RANDS THATSHIS PICTRE JS
2556,THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT,TI HAS A BOGEPWITH YOU TO N
2557,A MIXTURE,MIXSTURE
2558,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES,I THINKF YO T SEPERAT YO HAPERATFO GOONG PERRIODOF TIME UN TILL THE IS SEPERATED AN  ECTATERTHE WATERERAT
2559,THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A MIXTURE,HE DESALBED IN THE WATERTHIIS IMPORTNT BECUS DAVA MIXSTURE
2560,THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS THAT THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED INTO,THE WATER IS O INGNG ONBEING DSTED
2561,A SOLVENT HELLO WHAT,FAITH T ELEPHANTSWIL YO
2562,THE MASS IS INCREASING,THEMAH IS ENCRESN
2563,I THINK IT'S A SOLUTION,CLLUTION
2564,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS,ROPERATYO COD TAKE ART WITH A SCREEM Y S AEES YOUR HANDS
2565,A MIXTURE,MICSTURE
2566,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER,THELTHIS IS VERY OORTNTBECAUS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPERAT FROME WATER
2567,I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER,I THINK HE SL WILLPHE WATER
2568,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTALS,HEN CIBRO LIGRD IEM GETING T  I MIXTD WITH WATER THEN WIL YOU  O GATHERIHIT HAPENS IS  WITH NOTHING OR CTOLO
2569,SOLUTION,SULLUTIAN
2570,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS,I NOTISTHAT WI YOU PUS YOUR THINGS TATHER YOUEVESTAS IN THE WATER DISAPEARD
2571,HERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT,SD CAN BESOLPED IN THE WATER WATER CAOT BE
2572,IT IS EVAPORATING,APERATOED
2573,YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND,YOU CANOPERAT YOU  GTOUTF MY HANDS
2574,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT,THINKS TOTHERWIL CREATE A DIFRENT WAS
2575,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WEHAVE BEN MIXSTURES IN SELUTION
2576,HERE THE FLOUR IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ONTO THE BOTTOM AND AND THE REST OF THE FLOUR STAYS ON THE TOP IN THE COFFEE FILTER,THE FLABER IS BEING ATED TO THE WATERA WHE I IS THE WATERTHE WATER GETS ORD DOWNAELTHE WATER GOWS THRITO THE BOLTERTHE FLAER STAPSTHE TOP INTHE COLFELER
2577,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,ANNT PICTURE IS WATER O WATER WATER MIXTURETH ATER FIFTY GATH FIFTEN GM SIXT FIVE
2578,A MIXTURE,MISTURE
2579,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,THE WATER ES FIFTY A FIFTEEN HEN YOU ABT CREATS N MIXTJUR ANDWAS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
2580,GOOD,G
2581,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTIONS,TIS HAPENNDIFRN THINGS AR MIXT WITH WATER IN MAKING SIELUTION
2582,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT,I YOU  OTHING IN TO A CUB SCA FOR SOME GRAMUS WI YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUBR EALELE YOU PUT AN NOTHER TING A TO THE MIXSTER YOU EARGRAMUS EALE
2583,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE,THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPERATE THEMBECAUS YOU CAN'T PIKHANDFELER DOESN'T WRK YUOPERATE
2584,THAT WATER PLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION,THA WATER P F MATERIALEILLUSION
2585,SURE MARNEY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS,WE TOKE ABOUT MIXTURES  ELUTIONSWE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURE ELUTIONS TALK ABOUT ATHEARE ALL TALKED ABOUT IN MY APINION WHE YOU TAKE WATERTHERYO  THE WATER IN YOUR  CSODS
2586,THE SALT,VESAUL
2587,THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE,EPRDNO THE WATERIT REATES A MIXSTURE
2588,ONE KIND OF GRAMS PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS GRAM TOGETHER,ONE PUS ONE CIND OF CRAM EATLGA TOEATHER
2589,THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE,THAT MEAN IT IS A MIXSTURE
2590,YOU COULD LET IT EVAPORATE,YOU CAN  VPERATES
2591,NO,NO
2592,TIME,TIME
2593,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE AND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL,VAPERATION YOU SOALIN WATER TO GTHE THE NEU U LEVE THEARFILATER WILL ZOPERATE IN TO THE AR CRISWIIL STAY
2594,I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION,STU AEDR INTO THE WATERYOU TAK THS YOU PUT TU THE FIELD AR OU YOU CAN CLER SEE THA ALLEVET GOS DOWN NOTHING COLD ILUSTIONS
2595,THE SAND AND IN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE THE SAND STAYS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YOU IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT,ASANTON WATER MIXTUR SAND CHASE THE BOUTTERME AN YOU CAN SOALT  WATER DEZS YOU CAN'T SEVE
2596,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE,I EATHER WIT TEN GRAMS AR TWENTY GRAMSI THER IX GATHER FIFTY GRAMSNDI THER IFNTSXTE OLD
2597,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT,THAT W YOU IX TWO THINGS TOTHER CREATE A BIG MATHRWAGE
2598,I KNOW THAT NOTICE THAT SALT IS BEING MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP WITH THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER,STEMIXT WITH WATERHEN TS PU SO HA COUFF FIELDRNDTHE WATER GOS DOWNTHE BOTERMIN STED OF STRYING HE TOPOF HE COUFFY FIELDRIT GOS DOWN WIH
2599,OKAY,OKAY
2600,UM CAUSE I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE,COLLIC THINKS A ARE EASIER TO YOU
2601,WELL IT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILLIMETERS CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOOR TO SOMETHING OR HOLD IT AND THEN MEASURE UP TO YOU COULD DO THAT AND STUFF,YOU CD A O MELEMATORES A TOMATORSFROTHE FOUR  SOMTHING  DONRS
2602,HOLD THE TAPE MEASURE LIKE I SAID AND THEN MAKE THEM LEAVE OFF LIKE I SAID UM AND THEN MEASURE UP FROM THERE,HTNRT M EIS THA MYOU SHOULD REALLY PAY A TENTI ON
2603,UM YOU WOULD BEGIN AT ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND THEN END AT THE OTHER SIDE,YOU ONSIDE TH TABELE THE OTHER SID
2604,IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO HEIGHT UM N SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE BY TO YOUR HEIGHT REALLY BY TO YOUR HEIGHT YEAH,ITIS VERY VERY SIMUMTIMES IT WILL BE THE SAMIT WILL BE CLOASE TO YOURR
2605,WAIST TO KNEE AND STUFF,WASE AB E STOF
2606,UM INCHES CENTIMETERS AND MILLIMETERS,EN SHES SIND EPATOS IN ELEVATORS
2607,IT'S EASIER TO MEASURE,EASIER TO MASURE
2608,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BEGIN ANYWHERE YOU REALLY WOULDN'T MEASURE,BECAUSE YOU DIDN'TA

2617,YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE LIKE UM YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE A ME METERS BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE THAN SMALLER THINGS I THINK,YO WILL PROBLY YUH LIKYEO WIL PROBLY YUTH A MEATORS BECAS THEIR EASIER TO YUN SMOALLER THINGS
2618,I DON'T KNOW,OO
2619,YOU COULD LIKE UM,O  THE OUM
2620,UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS,DON'T R E AAR
2621,UM WHAT'S THE UM YOU SHOULD GO F YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TAPE MEASURE GO TO THEIR FEET AND THEN GO UP AND MAKE THEM HOLD THEIR FINGER WHERE YOU LEFT OFF AND THEN TAKE IT OFF AND THEN UM PUT IT ON AGAIN LIKE PUT IT SO IT GOES UP AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT IS,YOU SURYO DAK THE  MISERG GO UP AND MAKE THE CODTHEUR FINGER WI YOUR LEP DOPH  OLPHPUTH DON APUIN YOU CAN SEE
2622,YOU CAN FILL THE CUP WITH WATER SINCE THE SYRINGES FILL UP TO FIFTY UM EVERY TIME YOU TAKE YOU TAKE FIFTY MILLILITERS,HE  S  THE   O T N  I
2623,TO SEE LIKE HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,OU THE SAM IK HRE
2624,YOU USE UM A GRADUATED CYLINDER TO MEASURE THE WATER LEVELS,M EG THI S THE U
2625,IT HAS MARKS ON IT THAT SAY TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY AND NINETY AND A HUNDRED MILLILITERS,DR  AR OUT SEVEN  T THRTY IY THE
2626,A LITER IS ANOTHER THING OF MEASUREMENTS,ETHE O T
2627,MILLILITERS IS A SMALL LITTLE THING AND IT TAKES A THOUSAND MILLILITERS TO FILL ONE LITER,THE  ZER  IX N THE
2628,UM MILLIMETERS ARE SMALLER THAN LITERS AND,R
2629,WHEN THE THING'S REALLY BIG LIKE OR ELSE TAKE A LONG TIME TO FILL,HE TI S L THE R SER TAKEA
2630,CHANGED BY WE WOULD PLACE UM A LITTLE MARKER IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS TO SEE UM HOW STRONG THE FLOW STILL IS WITH IT BLOCKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD,PY A LL MARCRT IN BETWEEN BETWO MAGMONTSFLO SS WITH BROFIELD
2631,WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED STICKERS AND WE PUT EM ON A GRAPH TO SHOW UM HOW MANY SPACERS THAT WE COULD USE BEFORE THE MAGNETIC FIELD BROKE,STICKERSN WE PUT ON A GRAFFA FOUR THE FIELD
2632,WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAPHING THE INFORMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AS THE MORE SPACERS THAT YOU PUT AND HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL GET,INFRMATIONCSPUT IN SOUNG THE MATIC FIELD
2633,WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD UM TWO MAGNETS ONE WAS IN A PLASTIC CUP THE OTHER WAS ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE AND WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY WASHERS WE COULD FIT INTO ANOTHER CUP,MAMETAACH THE BATTMWE SEE HOW MENEY WATHERS WE CAN FIT IN TO A NOTHER CUB
2634,UM FOR THIS EXPERIMENT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE STANDARDS,EXPERMONARNOCIHT SURE WAS IASTA
2635,YOU'RE WELCOME,ROC
2636,MMM THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT CAUSE THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU ADDED THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAD SO THE LESS WASHERS YOU CAN FIT INTO THE CUP,THAON THE AS YOU ADED TH A NATIC  WASHE F IN THE C
2637,YES IT WAS,S
2638,DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FIELD WOULD FLOW THROUGH TO KEEP IT HELD SO THAT THE BALANCE WOULDN'T BREAK,TARASS YOU PUT IN BE TWEEN THE TWO MAGNETIC FIELD WITH FL BALNTTH
2639,YES THEY DID,A
2640,WHAT WE FOUND WAS UM THE INFORMATION ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS,WENDAS A INFRATION ONE
2641,TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU PUT UM S THINGS OR IN THIS CASE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE LESS MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAS,FOLOUTTHPASRS IN BETWEEN THE FRAGMONTHE MAGMETIC IT AS
2642,WELL I FOUND OUT THAT UM WITH THE REGULAR MAGNET YOU CAN FIT TWENTY ONE WASHERS INTO THE OTHER CUP BEFORE BREAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD,WITTHE RAGLERMYO CU FIT TWENTY ON WATERS INT THE OTHERPBFOURFIELD
2643,UM NO NOT ALL OF US DID BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY COMPARE THE RESULTS THAT EACH GROUP GOT,WE DIDN'T RELLY COMPAR THE REZR
2644,YES,YES
2645,THE MAGNETIC FORCE BREAKS,MAGNETIC FO
2646,GOOD,O
2647,UM YES WE DID WE HAD A SCALE WITH A BAG OF WASHERS AND ALSO FIVE SPACERS TO USE AND OF COURSE THE MAGNETS,E A SCAPL WITH BAG OF WATERES AND ALSO FIVE ASERES EMANDO
2648,WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS RECENTLY WE WERE EXPERIMENTING WHAT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND WHAT DOESN'T,EXSPERMENTIN OTCNS ALECTRICTYS
2649,A CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE WIRES THAT GO AROUND THAT COMPLETES THE ELECTRIC FLOW SO THAT IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE,YOUV WIRES GTHE COMPLET ILLECTRK SON GONG IN A CIRCOLE
2650,RKING AND THEN WHEN YOU BY THE SWITCH IT WILL ALLOW THE UM ELECTRI,YOU CLOTHES IS WILL ALLO LACTIN
2651,WELL IT'S THE SAME AS THE LAST ONE ONLY THOUGH THEY'RE USING A MOTOR IN THIS ONE AND IT STILL HAS THE BA,THE SA LASST E R YOUSNG MOTER
2652,I THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME SORT OF PIECE OF METAL WOULD WORK LIKE A MAYBE A BLOCK OF GOLD OR IRON MIGHT WORK,I THINK SOME SORT  PEASE OF METOLE WIL WRKLIK A MA BE A BLO GOD
2653,IT TURNS AROUND THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS FLOWING THROUGH ONLY THOUGH IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S STILL COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE,TURNRON THEBATRPS FLOCM FROM THE NEGATIVSD
2654,TO ME THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND IT HEATS UP CAUSE IT CAN'T GO THROUGH AS WELL SO IT LIGHTENS UP,LOOK LIKE A PARRLRMKE THE LL THELECTIEE FLO ELEMANT EASCAUS IT CAN'T GOAS WELLN
2655,WELL WHAT THAT DOES IS CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO MAKE WHATEVER YOU'RE USING WORK,CONDUT ILECTRISOTY TO MAKE WVER YU
2656,THINK IT IS BECAUSE AND MOST ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IF IT DOESN'T FLOW FROM THE UM NEGATIVE SIDE IT MIGHT NOT WORK BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE ABOUT THAT,BT ILECTCRONTIF IT DOES N'T FLOW FROM THENGISIDNO EZACLY
2657,SWITCH IS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT SO THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE CIRCUIT IS U,RE YOU CANWHEN THE SWAGE IS OPEN THE CIRCUSWI
2658,YES,
2659,NO,
2660,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL AND IT COMPLETES THE CIRCUITS SO THAT THE MOTOR WILL WORK,THEERCS AD OF SOME SORT METOAND COMPLET CIRCUTHTH VLE WARK
2661,O IF YOU WANTED TO COMPLETE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY YOU WOULD USE SOME SORT OF C,IF YOU ONTED TO COMPLETHE FLOIM SORT
2662,WHAT IS UP WITH THEM IS THAT THEY AREN'T MADE OF ANY KIND OF IRON METAL OR STEEL SO THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WON'T FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,THE ARMANF  I I THE ELECTIC CARON W FLO THROUIT  K TH MOLDOR WARK
2663,WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS SO THAT UM THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WILL FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,THE ILLECTIK CARONTS WILL FLO THROT THE MALDY WARG
2664,FLOW THROUGH,THROU
2665,TTERY AND THE SWITCH,W
2666,THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH JUST A BASIC ONE THAT GOES AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,G AROUND A SCIRCULE TO AE THE OALDER WAR
2667,WELL THIS PICTURE IS HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD SHOW HOW A BATTERY AND THE WIRES GO TO A LIGHT BULB AND AND IT HAS A PICTURE OF A SWITCH AT THE BOTTOM BUT THAT'S NOT THE PICTURE THAT AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD USE,THIS PICTUROH AN ELETCLE ED THE RE   HAS A PICTUR SWT AT BOTTEMLECLNJUCE
2668,YOU COULD ALSO CONNECT THE WIRES TO MAKE IT WORK,WCAUL ALSO COLLECT THE WAIRES
2669,THE WAY TO GET IT TO WORK WOULD BE TO JUST TAKE THE LEVER AND MOVE IT OVER TO WHERE THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THAT PIECE OF METAL,TAK THELB UNRTE  THE WARS CONECTDW THAT PEASOF MA
2670,GOOD,
2671,UM ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF IRON WILL WORK OR ANY JUST PRETTY MUCH ANY KINDA STEEL OR METAL WILL WORK,R THING TH IS ADF IR BLIS PRTY MCH
2672,YES THAT IS THE CORRECT PICTURE,THAT ISA PICTURE
2673,YES I DO IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIAL THAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF WON'T ALLOW THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT TO FLOW,THE MATERIEL IER MAD OT WILL ALO THE ALOGICL CARONT TOE FLOW
2674,I THINK THAT MOSTLY ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL LIKE STEEL IRON GOLD GOLD IS THE ONE OF THE REALLY GOOD CONDUCTORS WILL WORK,I THINK THAT A EA THINGTHT IS GA OS SOME SORT OF D S RELLY CONDUCTER
2675,WELL A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE A CIRCUIT SO THAT A LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR OR WHATEVER YOU'RE USING WILL WORK,HE CONDOUCTER ISMTHING THAT WILL LET ALEC TRISOTY FLO  THROIT MAK A SCIRCU TH
2676,WELL TO ME THEY S IT SURPRISED ME THAT THEY WOULD USE HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD DRAW UM HOW TO MAKE A MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB RUN,I SAR PRISE ME THE THE WI YO AN ALLECTCL ESON WITH AVE MAKE A MOLDER RUN
2677,WELL IT WOULD GO FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GO THROUGH TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND KEEP FLOWING UNTIL IT COMES BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE ON THE D CELL BATTERY,FROTHT LPBS FLOWANGUNTLL IT COMS BAC TEPSO SIDE OTHATR
2678,THE PICTURE THAT I'M SEEING IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE METAL IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER UM I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT WIRE OUTLET TO MAKE IT WORK,UR ITIS OPEN BECAUS TH IS NOT TUCHING THEOTHER WAR EBLTWR

3054,WHAT,WHITE
3055,THEY'RE ALL MOVING IN ONE DIRECTION THEY GO UP AND CURVE TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN COME BACK AND GO TO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO BACK TO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO TO THE BATTERY AGAIN,MEVING ON DIRECTION THEY GO OUP AND CARTLELBA THE OTHERGO BAK TO THE THER
3056,IT MAKES THE WIRES COME FROM THE BATTERY FROM THE RIGHT END AND THEN GO RIGHT UP AND THEN MAKE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS STAY UP THERE,WULD MAKE WARES CUM FROM THE BATTERY FOM THE WITEN GO RITUPL
3057,NO CAUSE THE ONE FURTHER AWAY IS UM ISN'T MORE BRIGHT AS THE ONE UP FRONT,NOR CA TA OND FR THE ANARIT AS LA

3646,ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT DID THE SAME THING IT EXPLODED BUT THEN IT JUST TURNED INTO A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER AND SOAKED THROUGH SO IT KINDA JUST FAILED,THE DID THE SAME THING AEXPLOTED TTOA BIG OL OF WATER INR TATO JUST FIELD
3647,GOOD,GOD
3648,H WELL IT WAS MY TEACHER'S IDEA AND SHE MADE US PUT WATER FROM THINGS ONTO THE THING YEAH,GIVE MY TEATER I  DISH PT WATER FROM THINKS O THE I
3649,I DON'T KNOW,DON'TNO
3650,THERE'S A BIG GAP OF AIR,HE WAS A BIG CAHTR
3651,YEAH IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE S IT AS ON THE SOAPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS,I NO TI SOUTE WATERTHE SOLPY WATER THIS AN TALI SOUTE WATER BECAUSA DOES N'T HAVE THE SAME A
3652,THAT IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER IT STARTS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN IT STARTS GETTING ON THE WHOLE PENNY,DONT EPS ING BIGER I STARTS IN THE MIDL
3653,CORRECT,DIRECT
3654,BECAUSE IT KEEPS GETTING IT'LL KEEP GETTING HIGHER AND IT'LL SPREAD IT OUT MORE,BECAUS IT CEPS ETING THINKS LG GETING HIGHER S
3655,WELL ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT'S STAYING FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF,WON THE SOLPKY WATERIYOU HAVE THE SAME SAME NOT GOI Y STA WATER IT DOES NOT HAVE TE EN GREEDITOF S GEVES YOUNG THE SAME STU
3656,IT FLIES EVERYWHERE,LYEVERYWAR
3657,THAT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MICROSCOPE IT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER ONCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY,WHENIT GOWING  I CIS ET BIGERTHE SCI A MIERI MAKES THA PANEY LOOK BIGERTLA
3658,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN WE'RE WE WERE SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER AND SALT WATER ON THE PENNY,NG WITH WATERUT HAPEN IF YOU US SILKY WATER MA WATER IN SALL WATER
3659,OH UM WELL WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF ONCE YOU G PUT A LOT ON IT WILL START COMING OFF Y OR ELSE IT'LL START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP,WATER ON  WIL BE GETIN BIGRN SHE PUTS A LOTE ONH A SR UO MKN ATHE
3660,HAVE N WELL CAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER,ABECAUS THEY G NEXT TO EATCH OTHER DEN THEY GET BIG
3661,GOOD,GOD
3662,ON THE SALT WATER IT'S TALLE,AC
3663,ON SOMETHINGS LIKE CARPET IT WOULD PROBABLY JUST BREAK BUT ON WAX PAPER OR SOMETHING IT'LL STAY LIKE A DOME,SOMTHING LIKEIT WILL PROBLY JUSTWHAERT STAIN LIKE A JAM
3664,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFACE IT'S ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IS IT IS ON ON SOME SURFACES IT'LL JUST EXPLODE AND YEAH,I THINK ITS BECAS JUST THE CIRCUS PANDSM CIRCUS WIS WILL JUST EXPLOSEN
3665,IT GETS REALLY REALLY TALL,REALLY REALLY TO
3666,ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S HITS AND IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT TAKES OUT SOME OF THE WATER,N THE SOUY WATER IT ATS I GOS DOWNN THE POP UPS THAT MIT TAKES OFF OME THE WATER
3667,SEE YOU LATER TOO BYE,ATR
3668,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF,DN'TRELOT IF HE PUTS ON RAPAPER MAKESA
3669,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ASORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO N IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH,AER BECASU THE WATER IT DUSONT TAK UP  MA ROUM  YO PUATER ON THE SOULPY WATER IT HAS SOP IN SUPES IN ART THE SOP MIXT ITTAKS  RUDOUSNGT
3670,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,NOMTHE WNOMT WATER I GETS HIGHER SOME THE WATERS IT GETS LO
3671,IT GETS BIGGER,GETSA
3672,THE BATTERY IT IT UM WELL IT HAS ELECTRICITY INSIDE OF IT,THE FB HAS ALEC TRICOTY INSIDE
3673,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OH WHAT WAS I GONNA CALL IT UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET,L E BART ALL THE TIME SOSA JUST A MAMN S WON POBLYD OFF TO MAK IT A MADNAND
3674,AND YEAH THAT WHAT I THINK THAT THEY DO WITH THEM MMM HMM,ANDFI THIN WITHM
3675,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED AND WITH THE MAGNETS FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL,WE LRND WITH MAG SOMTHING PICOUPE IR I
3676,MMM HMM THEN ALSO YOU COULD USE IT AT A JUNKYARD TO MOVE STUFF AROUND,THEL   JUMARD MO STS AROUND
3677,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACES THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT'D BE PRETTY BAD,CULDR ARN THINGS FOR LONG DESTENSSR
3678,YEP MMM HMM,YL
3679,UM YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND MORE MORE TIMES,YOU CAULD RAPLTOM ORM
3680,YEAH WHICH IS AT THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET MMM HMM,AS NOT TA HED OF THE MAG
3681,UM WELL WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THAT PART MY GROUP SO,WEYOU DIDN' RELLY GET THAT ARR

3684,THE WIRE BASICALLY SO YEAH,IR HICLEF SAR
3685,THE ELECTROMAGNET HAS ELECTRICITY,TELEMTS ALETICY
3686,AND OH WHAT WAS ALL THE ELSE WHAT WAS IT A UM,SANDTA  WAS EL
3687,PROBABLY HAS IRON IN IT,BA
3688,UM CAUSE IT WOULD JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY LIKE GET LESS AND LESS AND LESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES MMM HMM,I'M BECAUSE I'VE JUST YAUTS AOLT THE INARGYL
3689,UM THEY SAID THAT,ABLED
3690,UM WELL WE HAD MORE THIN WIRE THAN THICK WIRE SO SO BASICALLY THE THINNER WIRE WORKED BETTER,WLL WE HAD MORTH OND  THE LE UTTER
3691,UM OH LETS SEE THE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE HAVE NO CLUE YEAH ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS,SIL YOU DILD I THINK THE  ANE CNARGY ARE  PALURFUL  WAS
3692,YOU'RE WELCOME YUP,VERYWALCUM
3693,PROBABLY YOU CAN WELL PROBABLY YOU CAN ACTIVATE IT EASY MORE EASILY YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF,YO AN AP TVATOYOU CAN ROFF
3694,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING,ZR TODAYW MAKING ALOMAG ALL SOM WEUR TRYING DOFRON'T THINGS WITH ILECTR MRAGMENTD
3695,NOPE,
3696,NOT REALLY NOPE,NOREALLY
3697,WELL ELECTROMAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP SINCE THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM,I' IL LICTER ME IS JUST EDL TES W THER SORT OF R
3698,IRON,HIR
3699,YEP,HOOF
3700,TO TEST THE MORE WRAPS OH YEAH LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN WRAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN WRAPS MY GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN AND THEN FOR FIFTY WRAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS MMM HMM,WE'VE HAD TEN RAMPS IN THERETOSO TEN GUT ZERO TWENTYENOR FIFTY RAPS WEVE GOUGHT TWENTY FIVE
3701,AND,AND
3702,AS I SAID I THINK IT'S UM AS A BY IT'S CLOSER TO THE THE RIVET,BECAS AR SID I THINKM GET CLOASERTE
3703,WHAT UM,MAL
3704,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNET YOU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MMM HMM UH HUH,OD CARR OMTHIN DROPWITH RAG MENT YOU JUST CARRI  CARRI YOU CULDN'T ST PLLDOLPLOOKE LIKE A AR
3705,THE TO THE RIVET N AND WOULD,PURSH THE RIGE
3706,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETISM WELL THE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IT CAN AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET,I THINK AS E CLOASERTO THEHADDONOT HVE  TRAV AFAT CA WEARD A BITHE TRABE  MADMATISOM GETS BEAKER IN WAER AR COULD BE MOAR POTRFUL IF YO
3707,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP WELL PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM,GLL H YOUSFL YOUS DOWN STERESO PICK OUP CARS IN THINGS CAN LH
3708,THEN WHAT ELSE COULD YOU USE IT UM,TACOL GAM
3709,UM WELL,NAL
3710,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S ALL WELL IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICIS AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAG WELL I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT YEAH,THE RVEN EATS M IT A BRD SOM THING THET CAN CARRYVLI GASAND SO TI PICKS OUP THEWASH
3711,WORKS BETTER MMM HMM,PATTER
3712,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVE IT MORE ENERGY ES CAUSE IT'S CLOSER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT'D BE UH HUH,I THINK THOUGHT IT GIVES IT ERBECAUSI CLOHER DOUS  HAVE A TRAVEL ALLTHE WAY THRO THE WATERGETS RT THERBA TINKS APAFULL THELECTROMATRCLO
3713,THEY HAVE THE METAL INSIDE OF THEM THAT TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY I THINK AND THEN THE RIVET ACTS AS A,THEY HAV A MAO INSIDEE DRANS FRTTHE LEC TICODYTHE

3725,UH HUH YEP,
3726,YEAH BEFORE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PICK ANYTHING UP,FOUR WEN WE FIRST STARTEDMEN
3727,WE TRIED TO SEE DID IT MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE H HOW DOES IT DO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE,TYODN'T MATTER HOWTIK THE WATER WASD HOW TIE
3728,WE PICKED UP MORE WASHERS MMM HMM,WEVE PKED UT MARWASHRS
3729,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY MMM HMM,THATS THE TING PICKS UP THE WASHERIDWEHVE WATERES WI TRANSPORTLECTRISOTYW AVE A BATTER

3794,IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONES THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL,W LISIN O RTHE OTHER NRAS HAS TWO LLSO D
3795,GOES BACK IN THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,A CUMS THROU THE PLST INSIDE AND GO BACKGROUNDE
3796,WELL THAT THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB REPRESENTS THE TWO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IT'S IN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT UM AND HOW IT WORKS,A REPRESENTS TH TWO LOIONES I TH LIEBOL REPRESENTS LIBOLBECAS IF YOU SCROLS R TE N MENT E TACHES LIKE IN THEATIC DA YOU CAN O SE
3797,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE HAD SO MONEY CARLES CIRCUTS
3798,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN UM A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THROW F FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES,IS ANRUSTING BECAS EVERY SING ALTIAFLOW THRO MY HOST HOME I OPEN MY SCIRCUMS BOKS Y MEA ISI GU TO SELL THE WATERS

3801,THE PARALLEL THEY ARE NOT SHARING THE ELECTRICITY WHETHER THE OTHER CIRCUIT THEY ARE SH SHARING THE ELECTRICITY,NOT CAIRRING THE ELEC TISIODY WATHE OTHER CIRCUS TA ARIN
3802,WELL SINCE OUR LIGHT ARE STILL LIT UP LIKE IN OUR DOWNSTAIRS THEY ARE REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IN ONE ROOM IT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY STARTS IN OUR HOUSE AND LIGHTS IT UP A LOT BRIGHT BRIGHTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE,AIR LT PIR DOWN SA A RELLY BM BECASWEV ON ROM W THELLECTI STA DINNER HOUCSERITER WAR ELSE
3803,THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULBS AND ETC ETC,THEBLUED ARE THE ELECTRISOTY FLOWING THRO THE WAER S
3804,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS,IT HA BENI CIRCUTS
3805,YES,PUSH
3806,YES,YES
3807,ONE IS THE BATTERY AND TWO ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,ISTATRY  O THE LIFEBOATS
3808,THAT IT IS MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THAT II MOSTLY A CIRCUS
3809,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT,THE  SIRCUS A NOT CHERING HAIING THE
3810,I SEE,I
3811,IT IS GOING THROUGH ONE END OF THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING BULBS UP AGAIN AND THEN GOING AND THEN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,IN THRO ON ANDTHE RS BECUMING U THRO TH DEI BUBSPI

3815,HELLO MARNIE,YELO
3816,THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINED,THEY ARE JUST TOOBL CIRCUS C FIND
3817,HELLO,YELLOW
3818,BYE,FIVE
3819,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL COMING OUT OF THE OTHER END LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST GOING THROUGH A THIN A THIN WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB THEN GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL AND REPEATING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN,THRO  THE ELEC TRISODY IS ACOLY JUS WAIR IN THE LAOL
3820,THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PATH NO TWO TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY,THAT PALE CIRCUS HAS ONLY TWO ASTHWAYS EACH LIEBOLL ONE PATHAY
3821,THE D CELL IS LETTING ENERGY THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY,THE DE SALL I DING IYOUR TH WIR BTH BELS L UPWI THE SAMEGY
3822,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT THAN THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS,THE WS ONE PATHWA   AVTOTHER SCIRCUS BECSAR SEIRRING THE EL IN JUST ONE BIGST T LIL CIRCUS
3823,M WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL CAUSE UM SINCE THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WIDTH ER THEY'RE ALL WIDER,U THREE SEVEN MAUTEORS BUT THREE  A A DIFENT IN THE DAUNDSICAS THEARE WITER I THINKCASARHE SEVEN MATORES AR N  ANARI THINK THAA ALE
3824,HI,
3825,WELL WIDENESS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE AND A CIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHER'S JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S WIDER HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FOURTH GRADE THAT IF YOU S IF THAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'LL FLOAT SO WITH THE BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH THE WIDER BOAT CUP BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOAT BETTER AND HOLD MORE PASSENGERS,TS MEWE HAS  MTHIN  ONE FOT  SIRR ON THE OTHER YUTHE OTHER O WILL  ATER AND WILL HOLD M PASSONGERS WTER  ATER BECASATERCUS FOUR I ZAWE ULN TH FOURSCRAP THE BOUGS A  WATERTHEER  EVEN

3830,WELL UM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PENNIES LIKE ALL TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD KIND OF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU EVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST STAY EVEN AND AND AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER,UO  N SIDE WI CI A STARBECAUS HEIRS TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PR TICULER SII WOL'T IMP TD I SIDE JUST ST E GT TER
3831,UM I THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAT IT MIGHT SO THAT ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE,I THOUGHTY THEI YOU U ON THE BIG CLASSF CUPS JUOLSIVEN THE SAME NE IT CAN SPELL LIKE AM CAUS ONE THE OTHER CAN BE WT
3832,UM WELL THERE ONE H ONE UM CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER S SIDE THERE'S T TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S STARTING TO TIP THAT WAY AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GONNA TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK,EVEN SON THE OTHERSIDR T MY ON THE RIT SIDEP THAT WAYA FEOU ARDS  COMPLEAT LELD WITH WATER
3833,YEAH IT DOESN'T LOOK,YARD
3834,YO WHAT UP I'M READY TO LEARN,'LM READY N
3835,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HEIGHTS AND ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY WANNA TEST WHICH ONE WILL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATER,LOOKES LIKE TAAF SISIELTS INLKEI LOOKES LIKE A O ON CAN HOLDS THET PASSONGERSWICH HOLDS THE R WATER
