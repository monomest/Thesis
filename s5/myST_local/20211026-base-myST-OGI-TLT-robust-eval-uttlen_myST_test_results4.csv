0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE  THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINSCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HADD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE  IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY TWO
1,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH
2,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT A JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
3,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO
4,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID  I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S SAW IF THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
5,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SORTOF THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTALE LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHEART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE ROATE ON ONE TIME IT WAS UM SLENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCHES TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
6,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SSO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGED DOWN I GUSS SOMEBODYWE JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS THEY GOT SO
7,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM UM LIKE EXACTLY WE THE WAY OUR DESK WHERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND  LIKE MOSTLY IT EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS O ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
8,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE  THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE
9,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM U P STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UH LIKE THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE IS FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
10,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SYSTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ITI WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YO WOULD TATCH THE SSTRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE II I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEM YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE ST THE PENDULUM  SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO
11,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE FLIKE WE WERE TESTING THEM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG THEM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
12,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE  IF  WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BBEBE UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO IT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOMELIKE WE KEPT HAVING THE EXPERIMENTINT UNTILL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
13,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED WAS PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
14,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH
15,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE K WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO TH WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHAT HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS  LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN
16,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORED WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH A A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF
17,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WE'VE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WE'RE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LANCHER THING AND THEN THE UNLIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
18,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WELL WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
19,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH UM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERES AND THEN FLIPPERS
20,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THEN WHEN WE WEN TE C WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MIS MARDRA DIDN'T AGREE WITH THEI
21,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW  HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
22,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT M BUT THEN MISS MO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
23,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OUT O OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRYO DO NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF
24,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,MM HMM YEAH AND THEN AWELL THEN WE TESTED IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE S PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
25,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,WELL  THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFOURE CAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY IND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WAWE ADDED ALL THOSE TO TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH
26,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,EL WE ALL CAME UP WITH R VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS IN AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
27,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X A X IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER TH WHERE THEY MEAT AND WE WALKED AND LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE  STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT
28,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAPH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STEEL BUT UM WE IT WAS THEREWAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT
29,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,UHHUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE NEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT
30,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USED AN ALUMINU BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USED LIKE A BEED OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT
31,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,MM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX WAS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTILL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MIS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEARD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY AT ME AND TRAVES ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVES TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE
32,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH  UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELLER THE POWDER FU THROUGH I GUESS
33,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HAV THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE S THE MORE SPINS UH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DIDN'T WE DID IT YESTERDAY AN WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
34,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIDED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK TWO  WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
35,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED O H LIKE TO JUST PULL IT AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIENCE MENT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST END TO USS CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE  TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW HOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO SPINS
36,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL NO OU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN SO THAT WOULD BE COOL
37,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YEUP ACTUA  LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT ALIKE MOR A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY SO THEN WE JUST SIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A L
38,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOCKIDNEST WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON  OH YEAH WE'RE  KEEPING FORTY SPINS  WE'RE JUST TRYINGT FORTY SPINS LIKET DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
39,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLAINES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS  CAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT' SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AN THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMEN DOING UH A LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TOTHE SEET AND THIS WOMEN WAS DOING A FRONT HAND SPRING OFF THE IWA SHE WAS DOING A VALT AND I DO VALT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOW
40,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU GO AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEATS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FING YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY T TESTED IT LIKE ONCE
41,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PARTED IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE  UM CROUCIDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CRUKID
42,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,OH THE ALL THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE WERE THE UM THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME
43,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO HO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING IT AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWAY SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE N ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KI I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALF WAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO  WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING ITE AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWIING SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KINDF LINK I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE
44,YEAH WE GET TO USE IT AND S CAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FANS SO AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND IT GOES IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT'S WE'RE DOING S LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHER'S UM ARM SPANS LIKE WING SPAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN SO,YEAH WE GET TO USE IT AND CAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FAN SO AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND THEN IT GOES IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT'S WE'RE DOING LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHERS UM ARMS SPANS LIKE WING SPAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN SO
45,YEAH YEAH AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE DOING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THE OUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING UM SLOPE,YEAH YEAH AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WE WERE CHEWING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THE OUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTENESS UP THE STRING UM SLOPE
46,COUNTING OR MAYBE THE PROPELLER WAS JUST IT GOT MAYBE THE RUBBER BAND WAS A LITTLE TIGHT SO IT HAD TO GET LOOSEN UP BEFORE YOU COULD DO IT I DON'T KNOW,COUNTING OR MAYBE THE PROPELLER WAS JUST IT GOT MAYBE THE RUBBER BAND WAS A LITTLE TIGHT SO IT HAD TO GET LOOSCEN UP BEFORE YOU COULD DO IT I DON'T KNOW
47,WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT LA WELL YEAH THAT WAS THE STRING UM WE SORT OF WENT THE THESE GLIDERS YOU CAN WELL THE PROPELLERS YOU CAN TWIST UP AND UM YOU JUST KEEP TWISTING IT UP UNTIL THE RUBBER BAND LIKE SORT OF TIES AROUND ITSELF AND THEN YOU LET GO ON A STRING AND IT GOES LIKE FLYING IT'S REALLY AWESOME,WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT LOT WELL YEAH THAT WAS THE STRING UM WE SORT OF WENT THE THESE GLIDERS YOU CAN WELL THE PROPELLERS YOU CAN TWISTIT UP AND UM YOU JUST KEEP TWRASCING IT UP UNTIL THE RUBBER BAND LIKE SORT OF TIES AROUND ITSELF AND THEN YOU LET GO ON THA STRING AND IT GOES LIKE FLYING IT'S REALLY AWESOME
48,THIS IS THE RUBBER BAND AND IT'S PUT ON SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TWIST IT WITH THIS THE PROPELLERS ATTACHED TO IT THERE'S THIS LITTLE HOOK AND THEN UM WELL THEN WE WROTE OUR NA OUR PLANE NAME ON IT UM THE FRONTIER GLIDER AND THEN WE SORT OF GOT A SH WE WERE IN THIS AREA AND WE PUT A CHAIR ON ONE EN WE END OF THE LOCKERS AND THEN ON THE OTHER END AND THEN WE TIED A SH WE HAD A STRING TAPED TO IT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GO ZOOM AFTER YOU LIKE TWISTED IT A LOT UM HOW MUCH YOU TWISTED IT IT W THE PROPELLERS WOULD GET GOING AND IT WOULD SPIN AROUND LIKE T ON WE WIND,THIS IS THE RUBBER BAND AND IT'S PUT ON SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TWIST IT WITH THIS THE PROPELLER IS ATTACHED TO IT THERE'S THIS LITTLE WOOK AND THEN UM WELL THEN WE ROT OUR NAME OUR PLANE NAME ON IT UM THE FRONTEAR GLIDER AND THEN WE SORT OF GOT A WE WERE IN THIS ARIA  WE PUT A CHAIR ON ONE END OF THE LACKERS AND THEN ON THE OTHER END AND THEN WE TIED A  WE HAD A STRING TAPED TO IT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GO SM AFTER YOU LIKE TWISTED IT A LOT UM HOW MUCH YOU TWISTED IT IT THE PROPELERS WOULD GET GO AND EN THEY WOULD SPIN AROUND LIKE TO UNWI WIND
49,YEAH YEAH WE ALL TRIED AND WE EACH WE DECIDED MA ME MY PARTNER KELLY AND MY PARTNER DREW UM WE ALL WE TRIED UM TO WE WERE GOING TO DO FORCE SO WE DECIDED TO USE A FAN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A FAN BECAUSE ONE FAN BATTERIES WAS DYING OUT AND ONE FAN YOU HAD TO PLUG IN AND IT ONLY HAD ONE SETTING AND LIKE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PARTICIPATING BECAUSE WE HAD TO SHARE A LINE WITH THIS THESE OTHER GR THIS OTHER GROUP SO,YEAH YEAH WE ALL TRIED AND WE EACH WE DECIDED M ME AD MY PARTNER CELLY AND MY PARTNER DREW UM WE ALL WE TRIED UM TO WE WERE GOING TO DO FORCE SO WE DECIDED TO USE A FAN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A FAN BECAUSE ONE FAN BATTERIES WAS DYING OUT AND ONE FANNY HAD TO PLUG IN AND THI ONLY HADD ONE SETTING AND LIKE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PORTICIPATING BECAUSE WE HAD TO SHARE A LINE WITH THIS THESE OTHER G THIS OTHER GROUP SO
50,UH THAT IT WOULD TAKE LONGER THE CHAIRS WERE UM CROOKED THEN IF THEY WERE STRAIGHT LIKE SO LIKE IF ONE CHAIR WAS RIGHT HERE AND ONE CHAIR WAS RIGHT HERE IT WOULD BE SORTA CROOKED BUT THEN IF ONE CH THESE CHAIRS WERE LIKE THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LESS AND THEN WE ALSO THOUGHT OF FORCE IF YOU FORCE IT OR YOU WE AND THEN THEN THE NEXT DAY WE BROUGHT IN A FAN AND IT WAS SO FUN YEAH LIKE IF WE LIKE GO LIKE F THAT OR LIKE THAT WE JUST LET GO AND SO YEAH THE FAN WELL WE COULD PICK ONE VARIABLE LIKE W TWO PEOPLE PICKED SLOPE WA UM A FEW PEOPLE PUT PASSENGERS THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS,UTHAT IT WOULD TAKE LONGER IF THE CHARS WERE UM CROKED THAN IF THEY WERE STRAIGHT LIKE SO LIKE IF ONE CHARE WAS RIGHT HERE AND ONE CHARE WAS RIGHT HERE IT WOULD BE SORT AF CROUKED BUT THEN IF ONE THESE CHAIRS WERE LIKE THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LESS AND THEN WE ALSO THOUGHT UM FORCE IF YOU FORCED IT OR YOU WE AND THEN THEN THE NEXT DAY WE BROUGHT IN A FAN AND IT WAS SO FUN YEAH LIKE IF WE LIKE GO LIKE THAT OR LIKE THAT WE JUST LIKE GO AND SO YEAH THE FAN WELL WE'D COULD PICK ONE VARIABLE LIKE W TWO PEOPLE PICKED SLOPE  UM A FEW PEOPLE PUT PASSENGERS THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS
51,YEAH OKAY AND THEN WE CALLED THAT THE S S E B CAUSE THEN THE FOURTH ONE WE CALLED IT THE S S N D CAUSE YEAH,YEAH OKAY AND THEN WE CALLED THAT THE SS S  B CAUSE THEN THE FOURTH ONE WE CALLED IT THE ESS S END D CAUSE YEAH
52,I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SAID THAT ON OUR DIRECTIONS BUT LIKE I GUESS WELL THEN THERE'S A HUGE RANGE AND STUFF,I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SAD THAT ON OUR DIRECTIONS BUT LIKE I GUESS WELL THEN THERE W'S A HUGE RAINGE AND STUFF
53,UH PROBABLY CAUSE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MEASURE RIGHT OR AND MAYBE UH I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THE BIGGER BOATS PROBABLY HAD LESS BUT NOW I'M THINKING THAT THE BIGGER BOATS HELD MORE BECAUSE,UH PROBABLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MEASURE RIGHT OR AND MAYBE UH I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THE BIGGER BOATS PROBABLY HELD LESS BUT NOW I'M THINKING THAT THE BIGGER BOATS HELD MORE BECAUSE WEIGHT
54,BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S TEN LESS I'M NOT SURE YEAH BECAUSE IT'S ONE LESS THAN THREE CENTIMETERS SO AND THEN WE DI I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY LIKE TEN AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE WALKED TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP TO TEN AND WE DREW A DOT AND THEN WE TRIED TO CONNECT A LINE A STRAIGHT LINE BUT OUR LINE SORT OF ENDED UP CURVED LIKE THAT SORT OF,BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S TEN LESS I'M NOT SURE YEAH BECAUSE IT'S BUT ONE LESS THAN THREE CENTIMETERS SO AND THEN WE DI I DON'T REMEMBER T BUT I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY LIKE TEN AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE WALKED TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP TO TENAND WE DREW A DOT AND THEN WE TRIED TO CONNECT A LINE A STRAIGHT LINE BUT OURN LINE SORT OF ENDED UP CURVE LIKE THAT SORT OF
55,YEAH UM I WAS THINKING HOW FULL THE WATER WAS BUT THAT'S SORT OF IT DOESN'T R LIKE IT WAS SORT OF A YEAH BUT IT WE REALLY COULDN'T MEASURE THAT S SO WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEN ALSO IT SAID THE PENNIES UH THEY NEED TO BE DROPPED A CERTAIN WAY SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A BOAT RIGHT HERE YOU HAD TO DROP YOUR PENNIES IN UH LIKE A TRIANGLE YOU SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR BOAT AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND LIKE YOU SORT OF JUST FILL UP LIKE SHE HAD IT ON THE OVERHEAD AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IT YOU WANNA LIKE THE PENNIES WERE BLACK ON THE OVERHEAD AND SHE DREW A CUP ON IT AND SHE PUT THE PENNIES DOWN AND SHE WANTED THE WHOLE CUP TO BE FILLED WITH BLACK THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO AIM FOR MY TEACHER,YEAH UM I WAS THINKING HOW FULL THE WATER WAS BUT THAT'S SORT OF IT DOESN'T LIKE IT WAS SORT OF A YEAH BUT IT WE COULDN'T REALLY MEASURE THAT SO SO WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEN ALSO IT SAID THE PENNIES UH THEY NEED TO BE DROPPED A CERTAIN WAY SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A BOAT RIGHT HERE YOU HAD TO DROP YOUR PENNIES IN UH LIKE A TRYIANGLE Y SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR BOAT AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND THEN DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND LIKE YOU SORT OF JUST FILL UP LIKE SHE HAD IT ON THE OVERHED AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IT YOU WANTED LIKE THE PENNIES WERE BLACK ON THE OVERHEAD AND SHE DREW A CUP ON IT AND SHE PUT THE PENNIES ON AND SHE WANTED THE WHOLE CUP TO BE FILLED WITH BLACK THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO AME FOR MY TEACHER
56,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERYONE GOT A DIFFERENT UM MILLILITER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PA NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT W NUMBERS OF MILLILITERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERY ONE GOT A DIFFERENT UM MILLILITER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PA NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF MILLILITERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW
57,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF THE GRAPH OH YEAH THANK YOU AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOAT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOAT FOUR BUT I'M AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME,NO SHE GAVE US A COPPY OFTHE OH YEAH THANK YEAH AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOAT ONE BOATE TWO AND BOATE THREE AND ALSO ABOAT FOUR BUT IM NOT TU AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME
58,WELL I RE I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OUR BUT UH WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETER I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AMO MILLILITERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY,WELL I R I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OURS BUT UH WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETERS I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE  MO A MILLILITERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY
59,YEAH CAUSE THIS IS THE Y AXIS I THINK X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE Y AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGERS,YEAH CAUSE THIS IS THE Y AX ISS I THING X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE Y AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGERS
60,UM THAT WAS WE WOULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY IN S YOU COULD JUST FLIP OVER,UM THAT WAS  WE WOULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSIT OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOU DON' WAT TA PUT ANOTHER PENNY AND  IT COULD JUST FLIP OVER
61,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS AND STUFF YEAH UH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND UH THEN,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS AND STUFF YEAH UH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND UH THEN
62,UH LESS BECAUSE THIS E IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND IT ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND,UH LESS BECAUSE THIS  IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE IT MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND I ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATE IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND
63,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N E CAUSE MY K PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FI SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE IT'S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN UP HERE YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE SS ESS AND E CAUSE MY PARTNER WAS NAITHEN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'L JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN  YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE
64,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VBOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID FIVE WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
65,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,OH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEI'R SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM I THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOUT CAN'T GET IN
66,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAPH A LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAPH A LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TOO
67,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOUGH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL AND LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS ED LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE
68,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN AND WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S E N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN WE'LD PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S ES E EN AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN WICH YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY
69,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PR YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PYEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS
70,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACTUALLY WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUARTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN SSUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUALATED CCYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURE ID AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
71,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ES SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO AFFECT THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE RUFF WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE RUFF WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
72,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DID THIS WAS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS POBB UH WE DIDN'T YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS
73,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,UM WE DIDN WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO CALLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THAT WE DID  CIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO
74,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,YEAH YEAH WE DID WE I SORT OF FORGET CAUSE WE TALKEDABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT ANTHING AN
75,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER VOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE ROT LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE IT WAS A HUGE RAIN OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
76,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE  SAME TH OUR HOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WW HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GEFIN FIND AN A A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE PUT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
77,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPD TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO
78,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YEAH IT BECAUSE TYOU WANT TO HA FFIND WE WANA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOUD DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO I IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR U OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A  UM ALL IND ALL PUM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTITWELVE PENNIES
79,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHES OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE M LESS NO  LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS LODED LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES AND I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IND THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM
80,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE AND WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEN THEN YOU SHAKE IT AND SAW THE WATER RISE,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND THEN WE SHAKED IT AND SAW THE WATER RIZE

98,WE PUT IN A JAR OF FREEZING AND OF WATER AND THEN PUT IT IN THE FREEZER AND SINCE THE LID WAS SO TIGHT THERE WASN'T ROOM FOR THE ICE TO GO OUT OF THE TOP SO IT BREAKS THE GLASS AND THEN YOU PUT THE WARM WATER BECAUSE IT WAS HOT,WE PUT A JAR OF EAN OF WATER AND THEN PUT IT IN THE FREZER AND SINCE THE LID WAS SO TIGHT THERE WAS NROOM FOR THE ICE TO GO OUT O THE TOP SO IT BREAKS THE GLASS AND THEN FOR THE WARM WATER BECAUSE IT WAS HOT
99,THE ROCK BREAKS APART AND AND FALLS OFF THE HILL AND FALLS INTO THE WATER AND THE WATER SHEDS IT INTO,THE ROCK BREAKS APART AND AND FALLS OFF THE HI AND FLOWS INTO THE WATER AND THE W PUSHES IT INTO
100,THAT THE ROCK GOT FILLED UP WITH WATER AND THEN IT FROZE AND THEN IT EXTENDED AND BROKE DOWN IT AND JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL AND MAY JUNE JULY AND NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER PASSED AND THEY,THE  ROCK GOT FILLED UP WITH WATER AND THEN IT FROSED AN IT EXPANDED AND BROKE DOWN IN JANUARY FEBRUARY  MARCH EPRLJ JULY AND NOVEMBER DECEMBER PEST AND THEY TURNED IT O BULBY
101,WHEN IT'S ACID RAIN THE RAIN FALLS IN JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY NOVEMBER TWO YEARS PAST AND IT GETS ALL MOLDY AND THEN YEAH,WHEN IT'S A SADY RAIN THE RAIN FALLS THEN GANUARY FEBRUARY AND MARCH APRIL MAY JON JULY AGUS SEPTEMBER AND NOVEMBER DECEMBER FEBRUARY MARCH APRAL MA J JULY SMER  OEMBER JST TWO YEARS PASS AND IT GETS AMAND THEN YEAH
102,BREAK INTO TWO PIECES DURING THE FREEZING THERE'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF CRACKS AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WITH ROCKS INTO ICE SO YEAH,WHEN EBREKS ITO T PIEES TH THE FREZETHERE'S ONLY A LITTLE MADE OF CRACKS AND THEN HAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT OCHECADYEAH
103,THEY PUT A BOULDER BY THIS LITTLE CONTAINER THING AND THEN THEY POURED DOWN A A LITER OF WATER AND THEN IT FELL DOWN LIKE THE AND THEN IT FELL DOWN ON THE GROUND SO IT BUILDS DEPOSITION AND THEN IT CAME DOWN AND SHOWED HOW THE DEPOSITION WORKS,THEY PUT A RULER BY THIS LITTLE CONTAINER THING AND THEN THEY POURED DOWN A LITER OF WATER AND THEN IT FELL DOWN LIKE THE AND THEN IT FELL DOWN ON THE GROUND SO THEYB A DEPOSITION AND THEN IT CAME DOWN AND SHOWED HOW THE DEPOSITION WORKS
104,THE EROSION IS LIKE AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHEN WHERE WATER FALLS DOWN LIKE AT A CREEK DEPOSITION IS LIKE LIKES,THE EROSION IS LIKE AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAN WHEN WHERE WATER FALLS DOWN LIKE AS A CREEAK DEPOSITION IS LIKE LAKS
105,THE SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE AND SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO SINCE SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE IT MIXED AROUND SOLUTION A SINCE IT WENT AT THE TOP,THE SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE SINC LUION B IS MORE DENSE SO SINCE SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE IT MIXED THA ROUND SOLUTION A SINCE IT WENT AT THE TOP
106,OH ONCE YOU BEND THERE'S LITTLE CHEMICALS INSIDE IT AND ONCE YOU BEND IT THEY BREAK AND THE LIGHT STARTS TO COME OUT,OH WONCE YOU BEND THERE'S LITTLE CHEMICALS INSIDE IT AND ONCE YOU BEND IT THEY BREAK AND LIGHT STARS TO COME OUT
107,THEY PUT BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE IN A CUP WITH NOTHING IN IT THEN THEY GRABBED A CUP OF WATER WITH FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND MIXED IT WITH THE BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THEN MADE A PREDICTION,THEY PUT BAKING SODA AND CLASROM HLORIDE AND A CUP WITH NOTHING IN IT THAN YOU THEY GRAED ACUP OF WATER WITH FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND MIXE IT WITH THE BAKING SODA AN CLASSRO CHLORIDE AND IT MADE A PREDIPTION

202,THAT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS NO ACTUALLY IT'S NOT GONNA BE FIFTY FIFTY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LESS THAN FIFTY BUT I CAN'T PINPOINT EXACTLY THE C,THAT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS  ATSOLY IT'S NOT GONTO BE FIFTY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LESS THAN FIFTY BUT I CAN'T PN POINT EXACTLY THE
203,E AND THEN THIS IS THREE THREE IT'S NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS LIKE EIGHTEEN AND THIS IS LIKE EIGHT,AND THEN THIS IS THREE THREE SIX NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS LIKE EIGHTEEN AND THIS IS LIKE EIGHT
204,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS ONE IS LOWER THE THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS ONE'S THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY YES THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS ONE IS LOWER  THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS ONE'S THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY
205,OR AT SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE THE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU PUT IN IT,OR SOME POINT IT DOES STAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE DBUT T DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU POLER DIDIT
206,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S HA GONNA HAPPEN IS B'S ACTUALLY GONNA OVERCOME THE A,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S GOINGTA HAPPEN IS B IS  ACTUALLY GONG NA OVERCOME THE A
207,WHAT WE DID WAS WE POURED ICE INTO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERO IT TURNED INTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE NEGATIVE FIVE CELSIUS COLDER,WHAT WE DID WAS WE POURED ICE INTO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERO IT TURNED INTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE NEGATIVE FIVE CELSIS COLDER
208,AND THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AND THEN MINUTES AFTER ONE M MINUTE IT W IT WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES,AND THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AND THENMINUTES AFTER ONE MINUTE ITW WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES
209,UH HE'S GONNA DIP IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT FRIES CIRCUITS AND THEN HE DIE,UH HE'S KINDA DIP IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WEALL WHATD HAPPENE IS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT' FRI CIRCUITS AND THEN HED DIE
210,WELL THE VIALS WELL W THE VIALS COULD DO IS THEY'D LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS,WELL THE VIALS WHAT THE VIALS COULD DO IS THEY'D LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS
211,UM NOT E NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK IS WE FILLED UH BABY DIAPER WITH WATER AND IT GOT LIKE REALLY BIG YEAH SERIOUSLY,UM NOT NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THOH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK IS W FILLED A BAYBE DIPE E WITH WATER AND IT GOT LIKE REALLY BIG YEAH SERIUSLY
212,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OF LIQUID BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO IT FOR OR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE LEMONADE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OR SIMIL OR LE LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THERE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT A LEMONADE STAND AND ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THEY WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OPLIQUID BECAUSE WE HA O DO IT FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE LEMANADE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OR SOMEONE OR WELL LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THERE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT A LEMANADE STAND AND ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THEY WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT
213,WHEN WE WEIGHED STUFF IN LIQUID IN LIQUID OR WHAT SOLIDS WE USED GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAW THAT UM TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE KILOGRAM IS A THOUSAND GRAMS,WHEN WE WEIGHED STUFF IN LIQUID IN LIQUID OR WHAT SOLIDS WE USED GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAW THAT UM TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE KILOGRAM IS A THOUSAND GRAMS
214,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOILET PLUNGER LIKE A DA LIKE A UH NEEDLE THING LIKE YEAH YEAH LIKE,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOILET PLUNGER LIKE A DOT LIKE A A NEEDLE THING LIKE YEAH YEAH LIKE
215,WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER,WHAT THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER
216,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH
217,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAW ON THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAD TO TAPE THEM E TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAW ON THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAD TO TAPE THEM U TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS T ONE METER
218,WHAT WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANSWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE Y WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU G IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,WHE WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING O GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU O IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT RONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHIN
219,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'VN EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING
220,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,WHAT MADE ME REALLIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THEN THE OTHER CLASS MA M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THERES AND THEY'RE  DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM
221,WE WE IN TODAY'S MATH STUMPER WE WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS L ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS,WE WE IN TODAYS MATH STUMPER WEI WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS LIK ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS
222,NO BOTH WAYS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETER OH NOT THE PERIMETER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YEAH YEAH,NO BOTH WAS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETOR OH NOT THE PMITR IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEMB LENGTH YEAH YEAH
223,WELL H H I WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG,WELL HOI UN I WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GE IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANWER WRONG
224,WELL WELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS,WELL WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS
225,IS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT,IT WAS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THIMGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT
226,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REAL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTOR'S USE YEAH,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REALL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTORS USED YEAH
227,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S ABOUT IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK
228,AND WE SQUIRT SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS ARE LIKE THAT BIG,AND WE SQSEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR USS IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS WARE LIKE THAT BIG
229,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE MO BATTERIES LIKE LIKE TH LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED  AROUND HUNDED INS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAVE TWO BATTERI
230,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM U IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T
231,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINUSED THE LINE TO SEVEN  MA T ONS UI  NOTICED  BEFORE  ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
232,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT I DISCOVERE IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAPP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT A MORE  WASHERS STICK TO IT
233,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN IT PUT A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UPI ONLY PICKED UP TEN WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE
234,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,NCEAS WAN DO THAT  PICKS UP TO THE LOWER CAUSE YOU HN PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WI WHE BUT ITO A HUNDRED WONDS I AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH
235,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,U WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE 'S NOT SUPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS  IT HAS TO BE AA I A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING
236,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE REVERSE ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES  GOES UP TO
237,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT ISN'T THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE IN H  BE TURNED AROUND AT LEAST HAVE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE AND HE POSITIVE POSITIVE SIDE  TOUCHIN EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
238,UM IT WILL IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,ITLL ITLL THE LIGHT BULBS I SHINING BRIGHT AND BREGUA OR IT'S TO LIKE TAKE THE LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT
239,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,HAT'S GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES TIS A CIRCUIT IS UWHE WHEN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CASING WIR AND TE BASING WIRE
240,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU  JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TW LIGHT BULBS ITLL IT BE DULL AND IT WON'T SHINE BRIGHT BUT IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES ITLL MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS SHINE BRIGHTER
241,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT'LL IT WILL SHITE LOWER AND LOWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT A BATTERY WITH E BATTERY YOU PUT THE
242,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHATHAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT WHA BOTH OF THE IRES HA TO BE ON A BASING THE WIRE AND ON A CASING  WIRE
243,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,UIT'S NOT USED TO THEIR COLOR CAUSE IT SAS GREEN LIME AND IT' SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
244,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S HA SAME BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
245,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,W HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE  VIOLEAT TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED
246,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAHIT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE
247,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS SE RE NTT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS WON'T I IN IT
248,THE MAGNET THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNET THE MAGNET IS  IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOURE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP AS O MAGNETISM CONNECT ED TO IT
249,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT IS  EN YOU BARLY ADD ONE SPACER BREAKS IFAL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY  TO STICK ON
250,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN AOTHER CUPS TO SEE IHOW MANY U WASHERS IT BREAK ALL THE MAGNETS FALL
251,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FIRT FORCE GOS WEAKER BECAUSE THERES THE OTHER MAGNETS MAGNETTISM AND FORCE OF THE ORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER
252,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNETS ARE STILL TOUCHING EACH OTHER
253,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES MAKES THE FORCE KIND F WEAKER AN WEAKAR AN WEAKER INSTED OF BEING STRONGER HAN USUALLY THE FORCEI
254,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,WHAT I NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ON LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER A THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER
255,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S SEPARN BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE IN BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN I MEAN THAT KIND OF THE KIND OF MAGNET IN TEMTHAT'S ALL I HAVE TOS
256,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THIS VIDIA ONCE WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL OR THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPER CLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF IT
257,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL WTH THE THIN ONE S LIKE ONE I GUESS   ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EAS CAUSE IT'S TICK IN THE T  AND THEN I IS AND THEN IT'S GOING LIKE THAT AND' KIND OF LIKE MAGNET
258,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE THICK PIECE OF PAPER IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK AND TETHINN IT CULD BECAUSE IT SO
259,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT HOW   THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UMIT'  SO WEL STRONG THAT IT COULD GO THROUGH A NAIL IN ORDER TO HOLD A PAPER CLIP
260,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,I ACTING LIKE A MAGLIKE WE AWHE YOU COD WRAP IT AROUND A ELECTRICITY AND CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH AND STILL MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING AND LIKE A METAL AND REACTS LIKE A METAL
261,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON ITISTICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN ITS NOT IT CAN NOT STICK TO THE PAPER CLP
262,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT'S BECAUSE THER MAGNETISM CAN NOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH NY BETTER GRA THE PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S
263,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET AND A NAIL AND IT'S FORT KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
264,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,I THINK IF WE BOTH CONNECT TO THE WIRES THROGH THE BASE BALL IT WOULDN'T REALLY W BECAUSE THE  PLASTIC IS HOLDING
265,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,THE DIRECTION  FLOW WHENWHE THE SWITCH T D CELL IIT CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION
266,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,WHET I NOTICED THAT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE LIGHT BULB T LIGHT  S ORDR TO LIGHT UP THE L WITH TE ENERGY
267,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATTERY HELPS TH THE WIRE  AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP LIGHT IT ON AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
268,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S IMPORTANT SO THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK  GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU P THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TA  TO GET THE MAGNET
269,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,TEWIRE  VEN HO THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S PAR OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY COK TH
270,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY ST GOS THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ICONECTALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND THE IT GOES THROUGH THE  POSITIVE SIDE THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
271,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BECAUSE IT' IRON OR STEEL O THE MAGEI S IT'S STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND IN ONTO IT TO MAKE IT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCS
272,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WELL THE CIRCUIT OF THE SWITCH AT LEAST U SOMETHING HAS TO BE PLUGED UT OF A MAGNAGNETI FORCE O THEELECTRICITY CU ALAST GO THROUG SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE
273,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,WS TO HAPPENG AT THE RIVER AND  WIRES IS IT HAS TO ATLEAST CONNECT SOMEWHERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING OD
274,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT THE WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THETHE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS
275,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE  THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT M TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE
276,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,N  WHEN IT HAS A CLOSED CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO SCONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT ILWON
277,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE DESN'T EVEN CONNECT TO ITHE WASHERS BECAUSE AHAS NO COMPELL IT TO THE WIRE C
278,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF THE WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S SWITCHED IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF OF THE THING WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S FRIX IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING
279,UM WHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THE GUY HE'S LOOKING AT HIS REFLECTION AND YOU CAN STILL SEE IN THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF HOW THE MIRROR REFLECTS,TWHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THAT GUY HES IKING REFLECTION AND YOU CAN STILL SEE ON THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE  O  REFLECTS
280,WHAT'S GOING ON IS FIRST OF THE MAGNET JUST THE ONE IS LET TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE ITS START SAME IN ABSENT,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS DOES'T WAN A LET TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEIT'S THE SAME QUADRANT AND O THE OPPOSIDE
281,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT IS SERIOUS OKAY WORKS WIRES SO AND GO GOING WHAT'S HAVE ONE WIRE AND IN THE,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT A SERIES CIRCUIT WORKS IS BYHS SUFF AND S GO UO    HAVE ONE WIRE AND HEN THE  T MAKE IT ME
282,WHAT I THINK IT GOING ON HERE SINCE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT THE THINGS IS NOT ELSE AND THE NOTICED TO BECAUSE THE FILAMENT IT WILL BE ORDER GO TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB GIVEN ENERGY,BUT I THINK IT'S GOING ON HERE SINCE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT THE THING IS NOT BA OUT IN ORDER TO PAITLL U LIGHT UP BECAUSE A FILAMENT W IT WILL BE ORDER TO GO THROUGH THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL GIVE IT ENERGY
283,WE TALKED AT AND THINGS THAT STICK TILL ON MAGNET SPILLING ABOUT IRION TELL ME ABOUT IRON AND WHY JUST THIS STICK TO REFRIGERATOR AND HOW MAGNETS ARE USED,WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CERTAN THINGS THAT STICK TO  MAGNETS WE LEARNED ABOUT IRON TELLING ME ABOUT IRON AND  WHY DOES IT STICK TO A REFRIGERATOR AND HOW MAGNETS ARE USED
284,THE BLACK ROCK EITHER GREEN ROCK BECAUSE GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT WILL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE HAS THE SAME THING NOT IN THE OCEAN THAT STICK TO MAGNET,THE BLACK ROCK ARE THE GREEN ROCK BECAUSE THE GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT WILL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE IT HAS A CERTAIN THING THAT'S IN THE OCAN THAT'S BLACK THAT STICKS TO MA
285,WELL IT BECAUSE ITS STILL LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE IS NOT ELECTRICITY TO GO RUN THROUGH EACH,WELL IT'S BECAUSE IT'S TWO LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE 'S NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO GO RUN THROUGH EACH
286,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP
287,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND FOR HAPPENS IS RUNNING CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT HELP TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND WHAT HAPPENED IS WHEN WE CONNECTED TO  BATTERIE IT HELPED MAKE THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT LIGHT  E SHININGOT
288,WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT BULBS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH HIM AND RELATED IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE LIKE,WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT THE BULBS IS THEIRE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH EM AND THEY RELEASES IT AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO THE LIGHT
289,WHAT'S GOING ON IT GONE OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH BUT STILL USING THE SAME THING BUT NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND BY THE,WHAT'S GOING ON I IT'S GOING OUT THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BUT STILL USI THE SAME THING BUT THEY MAD AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY IN ORDER TO LIGHT UP
290,WHAT I OBSERVE THE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I OBSERVED THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS CIRCUIT IS THE ENERGYS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND GOING TO BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
291,WHAT I THINK WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,WHAT I THINK WHATL HAPPEN IF YOU ADED MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS IS IT'LL LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
292,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T NOT LIGHTING WERE AND WHAT NOW ITS LIGHTING SO BRIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING WELL WHEN WELL NOW IT'S LIGHTING I SO BRIGHT BCAUSE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE
293,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB WHEN BACK OUT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB BACK UP,IT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IT'S GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK OUT THROUGH LIGHT BULB THEN BACK OUT
294,I THINK THE CIRCUIT ONE TOP BECAUSE THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND AN XC BUT LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY BRIGHT,I THINK THE SECOND ONE TOP BECAUSE THERE'S A LIGHT BULB AND I SEE BOTH OF LIGHT BULBS ARE SHINING REALLY BRIGHT
295,OH WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES THE MORE ENERGY SOME MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU CAN LIGHT UP THERE IS ENOUGH NOT YOU ELECTRICITY FOR,WHAT I NOTICED IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY THE MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU LIGHT UP THERE 'S NOT ENOUGH JUICE R OR ELECTRICITY FOR IT
296,UM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THEY WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE THEY HAD POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WOULD REPEL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD UM GO TOGETHER YES,UM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THEYR IT WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WOURED TO REPELL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD UM GO TOGETHER YES
297,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEY'LL REPEL IF IT THEY'RE LIKE NORTH AND NORTH THEY REPEL AND IF THEY'RE SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEY'LL REPELL IF THEY'RE LIKE THE NORTH AND THE'RTH THEY'LL REPELL AND IF THE'RES SOUTH A SOUREPELL
298,YEAH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT UM THEY ALL GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THERE AND DOWN AGAIN THROUGH THE WIRE,YEAH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT UM THEY'LL GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THERE AND DOWN AGAIN THROUGH THE WIRE
299,YEAH THEY'RE ATTRACTING SO THEY HOOK TOGETHER EXCEPT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY HOOK TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S UM THE TABLE IS IN FRONT OF IT,YEAH THEY'RE ATTRACTING SO THEY HOOK TOGETHER EXCEPT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY WHOOK TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S UM THE TABLE IS IN FRONT OF IT
300,UM THE WIRES ARE USED FOR CONNECTING ON THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BASE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO GIVE IT LIKE POWER,UM THE WIRES ARE USED FOR CONNECTING ON THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BASE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO GIVE IT LIKE POWER
301,UH WELL THERE IS THE FILAMENT WHICH IT GETS WARM AND IT LIGHTS UP CAUSE IT THE LIGHT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH TO LIGHT IT UP,UH WELL THERE IS THE FILAMENT WHICH IT GETS WARM AND IT LIGHTS UP CAUSE I THE LIGHT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH TO LIGHT IT UP

364,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL THOF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER OR CORNER OR CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE  THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FI FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
365,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TIOTANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TIN TANIC THE THEIR LIFE BOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UM MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CROUISEBOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRU SHIP
366,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNY WIS JUST TALL OF E SLTE WE P WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN TLIT GO TO THE SIDE
367,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS SLASH PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
368,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,UM WELL OUR CIMINIES I DON'TN PRTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW WIGHT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK
369,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIAVTY USE IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTALE UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED  THAN THREE
370,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OKAY UM WELL WAIHT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT WAS WE TOOK THE COFFE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTUNARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE SPLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I SUH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL  UH ONE SIDE IT WAS GONG NA SINK EVEN FASTER SO
371,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CREWS BILT MAYBE LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TAROBL IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT A GASS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REALL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A GOOD GILLION TIMES BIGGER SO
372,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE UM WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARDER GUN 'S ALRAIGHT UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRDER GUN I WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT W'S LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREES DOWN HEREAN DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE
373,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND
374,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANT TO PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SARETOF
375,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT
376,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT IS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES
377,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MMM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBE TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN U LIKE TEST TUBES TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING IN ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK
378,W WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THAT MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE,WE WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TH MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFOURE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE
379,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UH ONE TO FIVE INCHES THAT YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UM ONE TO FIVE INCHES  YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS AND
380,WE THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TWO Y WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND,WEI THIS IS KIND OF AN TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAINE IT YOU NOW NATUNAL TREASURE TOO  WHEN THEY'RE HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEI'RE  UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND

382,UM WELL W THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT AND THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE,UM WELL  THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT IN THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYMORE
383,WELL UM WE W FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER WAIT NO EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST,WELL UM WE WE FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER WE KNOW EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST
384,E I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO,I I THINK I DID IT RONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO
385,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECI WELL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PENDULUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND IT W AND WHAT WE UH FOUND OUT IS W NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECIDED WELL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PENDULUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND IT AND WHAT WE U FOUND OUT IS NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
386,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER
387,MMM HMM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER E WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE,MM HM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER  WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE
388,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE
389,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHITE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO BY ONE BY ONE UM WITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHIHTE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO ONE BY ONE UM WHITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE
390,YEAH UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN M UH WE DECIDED TO USE ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO,YEAH UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN  UH WE DECIDED UH TO USE ONE OF OUR STRATOAGIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TOWO
391,WELL W WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON A STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY UH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIOUS OF TIMES,W WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNIY UH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIUS OF TIMES
392,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE
393,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THAT THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS
394,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TWO I THINK THREE FOUR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LINE DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND UH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TWO I THINK THREE FOUR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LINE DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND UH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE

396,WELL I THINK THAT UM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IT TAKES UM MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH ONE CYCLE THAN UH THAN THE TWENTY TH THE MINE THE THIRTEEN INCH JUST HAS A FEW LIKE ONE TWO AND THAT WOULD BE A SWING,WELL I THINK THAT UM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IT TAKES UM MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH ONE CYCLE THAN UH THAN THE  THE TWENTY THE THE MINE THE THIRTEEN INCH JUST HAS A FW ONLY ONE TWO AND THAT WOULD BE A SWING
397,WELL ONCE WE HUNG THEM ON THE BOARD WE GOT A KINDA PACKET THING WITH THE Y AXIS WITH THE Y AXIS AND THE X EX AXIS AND IT WAS JUST WAIT,WELL ONCE WE HUNG THEM ON THE BOARD WE GOT A KIND OF PACKET THING WITH THE Y X WITH THE Y AXI AND THE X X XIS AND IT WAS JUST WAIT
398,FIFTEEN SECONDS WELL NO BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAD MORE TIME I WOULD GET MORE AND THE LENGTH THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD GET MORE SO I GUESS THE TIMING DOES NOT MATTER YOU WOULD JUST LIKE MAYBE ADD ANOTHER TWENTY TWO OR ANOTHER FIVE SWINGS,FIFTEEN SECONDS WELL NO BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAD MORE TIME I WOULD GET MORE AND THE LENGTH THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD GET MORE SO I GUESS THE TIMING DOES NOT MATTER YOU WOULD JUST LIKE MAYBE ADD ANOTHER TWENTY TWO OR ANOTHER FIVE SWINGS
399,WELL THE LONGEST ONE WE HAVE IS TWO FIFTEEN UH CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE ONLY WELL I SHOULD SAY THE VERY LONGER ONES OR EVEN THE LONG ONES DON'T GET AS MUCH AS THE SHORTER ONES,WELL THE LONGEST ONE WE HAVE IS TWO FIFTEEN UH CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE ONLY WELL I SHOULD SAY THE VERY LONGER ONES OR EVEN THE LONG ONES DON'T GET AS MUCH AS THE SHORTER ONES
400,WELL LIKE I GUESS EVERYBODY MOVED AROUND THE ROOM AND WE BASICALLY UH LIKE EVERYBODY TIED IT TO THEIR DESK EXCEPT FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BUT SINCE I HAD UH THIRTEEN I TIED MY PENCIL TO THE DESK I PUT IT AROUND RIGHT HERE AND IT JUST KEPT ON SWINGING V UM A LOT MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS,WELL LIKE I GUESS EVERYBODY MOVED AROUND THE ROOM AND WE BASICALLY UH LIKE EVERYBODY TIED IT TO THEIR DESK EXCEPT FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BUT SINCE I AD  UH THIRTEEN I TIED MY PENCIL TO THE DESK I PUT IT AROUND THE RIGHT HERE AND IT JUST KEPT ON SWINGING VER UM A LOT MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
401,WELL LIKE OUR TEACHER SAYS WE CAN'T JUST LIKE IF THIS IS OUR SWINGER AND IT WENT LIKE THIS ONE ONE SWING WOULD BE ONE SO THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE THING,WELL LIKE OUR TEACHER SAIYS WE CAN'T JUST LIKE IF THIS WAS OUR SWINGER AND IT WOULD LIKE THIS ONE ONE SWING WOULD BE ONE SO THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE THING
402,WELL IT'S LIKE OF COURSE THE PERSON WHO HAD MORE TIME WOULD GET MORE SWINGS UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND WAIT IF UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY GET THE SAME,WELL IT'S LIKE OF COURSE THE PERSON WHO HAD MORE TIME WOULD GET MORE SWINGS UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND WAIHT IF UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN OR FIFTEEN THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY GET THE SAME
403,WELL WE H WE ATTACHED A PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AT THE END OF THE PENDULUM AND I UH WE PUT THE PENNY IN THERE AND AFTER WE DID IT AFTER A FEW TIMES UM WE ALL WANTED TO TRY IT WITH UH TWO MORE PENNIES AND WE UH SOME KIDS DID IT DOWN HERE SOME KIDS WENT UP HERE BUT IT STILL ENDED UP AS ELEVEN TWELVE OR MAYBE THIRTEEN,WELL WE  WE ATTATCHED A PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AT THE END OF THE PENDULUM AND I UH WE PUT THE PENNY IN THERE AND AFTER WE DID IT AFTER A FEWO TIMES UM WE ALL WANTED TO TRY IT WITH UH TWO MORE PENNIES AND WE UH SOME KIDS DIDN'T DOWN HERE AND SOME KIDS IT DID IT UP HERE BUT IT STILL ENDERED UP AS ELEVEN TWELVE OR MAYBE THIRTEEN
404,THAT WELL THE TWO HUN AND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KINDA JUST GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING,THAT WELL THE TWO HUNDRD AND FIFTEEN WAS SDANGLING FROM HERE KIND OFS GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING
405,I GUESS IT IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TWO OR ONE TWO THREE FOUR THE THE WHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE,I GUESS IT IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TWO OR ONE TWO THREE FOUR THE THE WHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE
406,YEAH LIKE IF IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE WAIT IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I JUST DID ONE TWO UM THEN THE LONGER STRING WOULD MOST LIKELY GET UM THE MOST AMOUNT,YEAH LIKE IF IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE WAIT IF THE LONGER STRING THEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I JUST DID ONE TWO UM THEN THE LONGER STRING WOULD MOST LIKELY GET UM THE MOST AMOUNT
407,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT 'LL DEFFINITLY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
408,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,UM MM HMM WE HAD TO DO  SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WE WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS  VERY CLOSE TO THE SKIND OF SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE
409,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UM LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CANON POLE FOR LIKE WOARDS AND WHAT NOT AND UM W'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE
410,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL
411,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WE YES WE WELL UM MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED AT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GOES AS  GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT
412,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS THE POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTILL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
413,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS TESO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE
414,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,UM LIKE HOW DIT WE SAID IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KIND AF CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPITNING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLEARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IS IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW  ILREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO A UM UH
415,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,UH HUH  THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMET OF A MEASURING UM KIND OF TAPE MEASURING TAPE
416,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND UM SO WE UM OU OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW F THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR IT OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAND I GETS THAT YEAH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT
417,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO  UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUSS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN
418,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULT SO THAT'S HOW MY TEACHER DESIDED  HOW WE'RE GONGNA DO IT AND UM WHATTEVER YOU DIVIDE D BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LOTS AT THES CALCULATERS SO AFTER THE DESIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GOINGNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THISS
419,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WILL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN BID BY THIS AFTER THA
420,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK A SMAL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT  U E ALUMINUM BOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USED OUR FINGER SO WE USED HE POPSICLE STICK
421,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS
422,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,SO LIK SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO  CLOSE TO THE TAPE SO T WOULD SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS  ONE
423,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UMALUMINUM VU GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE 'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO
424,THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT UH THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT,WEN MORE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT UH THE WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT
425,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT
426,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND IN IN MORE AND MORE,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTALE THE STICK IS TOTLE SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND THEN THEN MORE AND MORE
427,THE SWIRLY THINGS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THE L BIG LINE AND THE SMALL LINE ARE IS THE BATTERY RIGHT HERE,THE SWRLI THINGS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THE  BIG LINE AND THE SMALL LI RE IS THE BATTERY
428,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT HAS ONE TWO WIRES COMING OUT TWO WIRES COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM AND TWO COMING OUT OF THE TOP,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT HAS WTWO WRS COMING OUTTWO WIRES COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM AND TWO COMING OUT OF THE TOP
429,IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T LIGHT,IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T LIGHT
430,ONE OF THEM HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT ONE HAS ONE LIGHT BULB AND IT'S REALLY BRIGHT,ONE OF THEM HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT ONE HAS ONE LIGHT BULB AND IT'S REALLY BRIGHT
431,THE SWITCH THE SWITCH'S ROLE IS TO MAKE ELECTRICITY THRO FLOW THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNET AND TO MAKE THE WASHERS STICK TO THE RIVET,THE SWITCH THE SWITCH IS RL IS TO MAKE ELECTRICITY TH FLOW THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNET AND TO MAKE THE WASHERS STICK TO THE RIVET
432,BECAUSE WHEN WE CLICKED ON SHOW FLOW THE LITTLE ELECTRICITY MAG THINGS FLEW THROUGH THE RIVET AND MADE THE MAGNET STICK,BECAUSE WHEN WE CLICKED ON SHO FLOW THE LITTLE ELECTRICITY AD THINGS FLEW THROUGH THE RIVET AND MADE THE MAGNET STICK
433,SOME T SOME MAGNETS STICK IN SOME WAYS SO IF YOU TURN THEM ON ONE SIDE THEY STICK IF YOU TURN THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY DON'T STICK,SOME TSOM MAGNETS STICK IN SOME WAYS SO IF YOU TURNTHEM ON ONE SIDE THEY STICK AND IF YOU TURN THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY DON'T STICK
434,WHEN YOU WIND IT ONE HUNDRED TIMES IT H HOLDS FIFTEEN WASHERS WHEN YOU HOLD IT TEN TIMES IT'LL PROBABLY ONLY HOLD ABOUT ONE,WHEN YOU WIND IT ONE HUNDRED TIMES IT HOLDS FIFTEEN WASHERS WHEN YOU HOLD IT TEN TIMES ITLL PROBABLY ONLY HOLD ABOUT ONE
435,THE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ONE WAY IS YOU LIST IT ONE THROUGH TEN ON THE X AXIS AND THE Y AXIS,THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ONE WAY IS YOU LIST IT ONE THROUGH TEN ON THE X AXIS AND THE Y AXIS
436,THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE THE MOTOR AND ITS MAKING THE MOTOR GOES THROUGH THE ITS MAKING MOTOR SPIN AND THEN OTHER ONE IS GOING THROUGH,THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO CONNECTING TO THE THE MOTOR AND IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR GO THROUGH THE IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES GOING THROUGH THE
437,THE D CELL HAD BEEN ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE IT MAY CONTAIN D CELL,THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN THERE SO IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND BACK INTO THE D CELL
438,ITS GIVING ENERGY THROUGH THE D CELL ACTUALLY LIKE ONE OF THEM GO AHEAD NEXT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE ACTIVITY CELL,IT'S GIVING  ENERGY THROUGH THE D CELL UP TO THE LIGHT BULB THEN WIRE NEXT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO THE D CELL
439,THAT WHEN ONE BATTERY WILL ALLOW THE OTHER ONE WE NEED ONE IS OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS COME BACK IN WILL GIVE LATER AND LATER,THAT WHEN ONE BATTERY RUNS OUT THE OTHER WILL WHEN IT RUNS OUT THE OTHER WILL COME BACK IN AND TLL GET LIGHTER AND LIGHTER
440,IT IS YOURSELF PROVIDES A BECAUSE SO THE WIRES IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE THE BATTERY IN THE INPUT ON TO THE LIGHT LATER,A D CELL PROVIDES A CIRCUIT BECAUSE SO SO THE WIRES IF IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE THE BATTERY AND THEN PUT IT ONTO THE LIGHT IT LIGHT UP
441,IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE LEFT TO MAKE A LIGHT ON THE SIDE AND MAKE GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE,IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE WALL TO MAKE IT LIGHT ON THE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE
442,ITS BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND IS WHEN IT IS OF THE LIGHT BULB,IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHENYOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON  OU UNIT OFF THE LIGHT WON'T T
443,THE SERIES CIRCUIT WILL REPLACE THAT BECAUSE ITS TRAVELLING ENERGY FROM THE PLUS AND THEN WHEN YOU GET INTO THE MINUS WILL GO THROUGH THE PLUS AND BACK TO THE SWITCH AND THEN TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO THE MINUS,THE SERIES CIRCUIT WILL WORK LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S TRAVELING ENERGY FROM THE PLUSS AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE MINUS IT'L GO THROUGH THE PLUSS AND BACK TO THE SWITCH AND THEN TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO THE MINUS
444,ITS ITS ONCE SIDE THE PLUS ARE GOING TO AROUND INTO THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE MINUS,IT'S IT'S ONE SIDE THE PLUSS ARE GOING AROUND INTO THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE MINUS
445,IT'S THE FIRST ENERGY TO THE SECOND ENERGY TO THE THIRD ENERGY AND WHEN IT BREAKS IT WILL WHEN ALSO THAN WHEN THEY PUT INTO LIGHT BULB IN IT WILL GO BACK,IT'S THE FIRST ENERGY TO THE SECOND ENERGY TO THE THIRD ENERGY AND WHEN IT BREAKS IT WILL RUN OUT SO THEN WHEN THEY PUT ANEW LIGHT BULB IN IT WILL GO BACK
446,WHEN SOUTH AND NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL ATTRACT WHENEVER NORTH AND NORTH IT WILL REPEL SOUTH AND SOUTH WILL REPEL SOUTH AND NORTH WILL ATTRACT,WHEN SOUTH AND NORTH NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL ATTRACT WHEN NORTH NORTH AND NORTH IT WILL REPELL SOUTH AND SOUTH WILL REPSOUTH AND NORTH WILL ATTRACT
447,WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECTED TO THE BLOCK THEY WON'T ATTRACTS BECAUSE AS IRON INSIDE OF IT IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON INSIDE OF,WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECT IT TO THE BLOCK IT WON'T ATTRACT BCAUSE IT HAS IRON INSIDE OF IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON INSIDE OF
448,THIS NAIL WILL ATTRACT BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND AND THE RIVER ROCK WON'T ATTRACT WHERE THE BLOCK WON'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT,IS KNIL WILL ATTRACT BCAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND AND THE RIVER ROCK WON'T ATTRACT OR THE BLOCK WON'T ATTRACT BCAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
449,IT'S IT'S MIDDLE AND INSIDE THE FRIDGE IS METAL TO AND METAL AND METAL OR IRON AND IRON WILL GO TOGETHER AND ATTRACT,IT'S IT'S METAL AND INSIDE THE FRINGE IS METAL TOO AND METAL AND METAL OR IRON AND IRON WILL GO TOGETHER AND IT WILL ATTRACT
450,I KNOW THAT UM CIRCUITS IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF THE LIGHT IN ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF,I KNOW THAT UM CIRCUITS IS WHAT I KEEP  THE UM LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF E LIGHT NOT ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF
451,WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF,WELL PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
452,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON UNTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK UNTILL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE
453,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BY TO OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM CLOSED TO EACH OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT
454,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UH THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT TH ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
455,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL ST,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE THE PARALLELS THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB  ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL STAY
456,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT
457,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PARE OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE
458,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK
459,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOINGTA TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE 'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY
460,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO FLOW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE 'S FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO THROW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE
461,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIHT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON
462,THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON,THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER  IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OFF A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON
463,UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH,UM WHEN ONE BULB BOOS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH
464,WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH,WELL UM THE WIRE IS KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH
465,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THING'S THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THINGS THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB
466,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ANY AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTELY CURVED WIRE
467,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS THE SAME UM AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS UM THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE 'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY
468,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB
469,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KINDA THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KIND OF THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP
470,WELL WHAT YOU DO WOULD YOU WRAP IT A KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THEN ANOTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOULD TURN ON,WELL WHAT YOU DO WHULD YOU'D WRAP IT A KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUSS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU'D TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THEN THEN THE OTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOULD TURN ON
471,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE OF THE NOTCHES OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE OF THE NOTCHES OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY
472,I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WAS IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T PUT IT ON THE UM BUTTON BUT UM IT IT WE IT'S GOING THROUGH A CERTAIN PARTS UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING IT GLOW COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING AROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN,I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WASN IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T FIT IT ON THE UM BUTTAN BUT UM IT IT W IT'S GOING THROUGH A CERTAN PARTS UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING IT GLOW  COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING AROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN
473,WELL HERE NO BECAUSE THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULB IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME,WELL HERE NO BECAUSE THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULB IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME
474,THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR WOULD SORT OF BE LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN,THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU ERE DRIVING THE CAR WOULD SORT OF BE LIKE A HIH WAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN
475,UM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT,UM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON TH THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON AND WHEN T'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT
476,AT THE UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM,H UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SCOCUITS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM
477,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
478,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KINDA THING AND YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO,E YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KIND OF THING AND YOU'D HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO
479,THEY ARE I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THOUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE V FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH,THEY ARE MAINLY BUBS THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THROUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY  COME THROUGH
480,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,E  I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST THA LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT
481,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
482,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,IT GOES FROM THE PLUSS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TILL IT STARTS GOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE EECRCITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BILLDS UP UNTILL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GON FROM THE PLUSS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT
483,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUSS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SI AN MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT
484,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOALL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TOO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES
485,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE INT
486,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS AN VERY IMPORTANT ROLL BECAUSE WHILLE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
487,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
488,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
489,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILLE WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOLL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
490,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN YUNEAKE PILE AND THIS IS IIMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEYR UNEC PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALL TOGETHER IT IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
491,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT IT'S PURPASE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING S  AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND  WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STUFF AND THAT AND YE
492,UH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK,THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FROUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLORSWIRL INSIDE AND I'M TAL
493,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER
494,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
495,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,THE SALAD HAS MANY THINGS MIXED INTO IT UONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEENS AND NORMAL BEENS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES
496,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN
497,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MAKES SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
498,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF OLUTION BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT
499,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
500,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY FULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE FANTASTIC,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTELY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERBLE IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE TASTETIK
501,WELL TODAY WE USED UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CAN'T,WELL TODAY WE USED U WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CA
502,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UM PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UORANGE PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE
503,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTELY SOER COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A CUPPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE
504,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LESS IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS A DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONS FULLS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH GLASS HAS ONLY ONE SPOONFULL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX
505,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNI FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAN ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WON'T,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNIE FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU COULD ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WOULDN'T
506,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE
507,ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM,ONE OF THEM HAS GREAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN
508,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A THINGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD UM YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A LITTLE THINGI AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE I HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH  JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE
509,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WAER ATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE
510,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SORRY WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN  WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR
511,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
512,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT WITH THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE
513,YOU COULD TELL HOW CONCENTRATED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER,YOU CAN TELL HOW CONSENT THEY'RE TRANTED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND THE GRAPE DRINKS MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER
514,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT  THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHE A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
515,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AN THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS
516,THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT,THANKS MARNI I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT
517,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIAD OF TIME UNTILL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES
518,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT YOU COULD LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A  YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS
519,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNIE BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER
520,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTALS,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS  WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTAL
521,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS,I NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU POUR TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISSAPPEARS
522,HERE THE FLOUR IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ONTO THE BOTTOM AND AND THE REST OF THE FLOUR STAYS ON THE TOP IN THE COFFEE FILTER,HERE THE FLOWER IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ON TO THE BOTTOM AND TEAND THE REST OF THE FLOWER STAYS IN THE TOP IN THE COFFE FILTER
523,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNIE IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAM
524,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
525,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WEIGHT THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT
526,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE
527,SURE MARNEY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS,SURE MARNI SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TIS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED OGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPPINNION TBEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIXE IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS
528,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE AND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNIE WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND TH IND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL
529,I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION,I NOTICED THAT HE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN WONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL OF IT GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCCIT BELOW THERE 'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION
530,THE SAND AND IN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE THE SAND STAYS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YOU IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT,THE SAND ANDIN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE THTHE SAND STAYS TAT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT THE IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT
531,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNEEK PILE
532,I KNOW THAT NOTICE THAT SALT IS BEING MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP WITH THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER,I NTH NOTICED THAT SALT IS BEING MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP OF THE COFFE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER
533,WELL IT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILLIMETERS CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOOR TO SOMETHING OR HOLD IT AND THEN MEASURE UP TO YOU COULD DO THAT AND STUFF,WELLIT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILLIMETERS CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOR TO SOMETHING OR WHOLD IT AND THEN MEASURE UP TO YOU COULD DO THAT AND STUFF
534,HOLD THE TAPE MEASURE LIKE I SAID AND THEN MAKE THEM LEAVE OFF LIKE I SAID UM AND THEN MEASURE UP FROM THERE,WHAT'S IMPORTANT MARNIE IS THAT UM YOU SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTIONWHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU SHOULD UM
535,IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO HEIGHT UM N SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE BY TO YOUR HEIGHT REALLY BY TO YOUR HEIGHT YEAH,IT'S VERY VERY SYMILAR TO HEIGT UM AN SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE CLOE TO YOUR HEIGT REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR HEIGHT YEAH
536,IF YOU WANTED TO MEASURE HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SOMETHING IS YOU COULD USE YOUR PINKIE TO COUNT IT OUT WHAT'S UP WITH THAT,IF YOU WANTED TO MEASURE HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SOMETHING IS YOU COULD USE YOUR PINKI TO COUNT IT OUT WHAT'S UP WITH THAT
537,ONE END OF THE TABLE AND THEN END AT THE OTHER BUT I SHOULD HOLD MY PLACE SO I DON'T FORGET WHERE I WAS,IT SHOWS ME I SHOULD BEGIN AT UM
538,YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE LIKE UM YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE A ME METERS BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE THAN SMALLER THINGS I THINK,YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE LIKE UM YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE A MMETERS BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE THAN SMALLER THINGS I THINK
539,UM WHAT'S THE UM YOU SHOULD GO F YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TAPE MEASURE GO TO THEIR FEET AND THEN GO UP AND MAKE THEM HOLD THEIR FINGER WHERE YOU LEFT OFF AND THEN TAKE IT OFF AND THEN UM PUT IT ON AGAIN LIKE PUT IT SO IT GOES UP AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT IS,UM LET'S TUM YOU SHOULD GO YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TAPE MEASURE GO TO THEIR FEET AND THEN GO UP AND MAKE THEM HOLD THEIR FINGER WHERE YOU'RE LEFT OFF AND THEN TAKE IT OFF AND THEN UM PUT IT ON AGAIN LIKE PUT IT SO IT GOES UP AND THEN YOU COAN SEE WHERE IT IS

742,BIOSPHERES ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE BIOSPHERE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR,BIOSPHERE 'S ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE BIOSPHERE CAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOR
743,PEOPLE ANIMALS TRY TO EAT THEM AND WHEN THEY EAT BACTERIA IT GETS INTO HERBIVORE AND IT HAS A POISON GET,PEOPLE ANIMALS TRY TO EAT THEM AND WHEN THEY EAT BACTERIA IT GETS INTO TE NEOR AND AND HAS A POISONGE
744,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE CAUSE WHEN THEY HAVE IN THE DIRT THEY ARE EATING THROUGH IT AND NATURE BUT IN THIS CASE THEY'RE IN A BALL AND THEY'RE EATING THE DEAD THE SCRAP,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE CAUSE WHEN THEY HAVE SO IN THE DIRT THEY ARE EATING THROUGH IT IN NATURE BUT IN THIS CASE THEY'RE IN A BOTTLE AND THEY'RE EATING THE DA THE SCRAP
745,I NOTICED THAT UM SOME THINGS IT WOULD SOAK THROUGH AND SOME THINGS IT SHOULD JUST SAY THE SAME AND THEN LOOK LIKE A WATER CROP,I NOTICED THAT  SOMETHINGS IT WOULD SOKE THROUGH AND SOMETHING I SH JUST SAY THE SAME AND LOOK LIKE A WATER DROP
746,ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT DID THE SAME THING IT EXPLODED BUT THEN IT JUST TURNED INTO A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER AND SOAKED THROUGH SO IT KINDA JUST FAILED,ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT DID THE SAME THING A EXPLODED BUT THEN IT JUST TURNED INTO A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER AND SOKED THROUGH SO IT KIND OF JUST FAILED
747,YEAH IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE S IT AS ON THE SOAPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS,YEAH IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE IT AS ON THE SPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS
748,WELL ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT'S STAYING FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF,WELL ON THE SOPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT'S STAYING FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAPE IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF
749,THAT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MICROSCOPE IT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER ONCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY,THAT WHEN YOURE WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND THEN IT S KIND OF LIKE A MCROSCOPE IT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER ONCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY
750,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN WE'RE WE WERE SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER AND SALT WATER ON THE PENNY,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN  WERE SEING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER AND SALT WATER ON THE PENNY
751,OH UM WELL WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF ONCE YOU G PUT A LOT ON IT WILL START COMING OFF Y OR ELSE IT'LL START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP,OH UM WELL WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF  ONCE YOU PUT A LOT ON IT WILL START COMING OFF  OR IT WILL START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP
752,HAVE N WELL CAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER,HAVE WELL CAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGR AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER
753,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFACE IT'S ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IS IT IS ON ON SOME SURFACES IT'LL JUST EXPLODE AND YEAH,WE I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFACE IT'S ON IT DEPENDS WHAT ISIT IS ON ON SOME SURFACES IT'LL JUST EXPLODE AND YEAH
754,ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S HITS AND IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT TAKES OUT SOME OF THE WATER,ON THE SOPY WATER IT HITS AND IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT TAKES DOWN SOME OF THE WATER
755,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DUM KIND OF
756,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ASORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO N IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUTON WATER AND ON THE SOPY WATER IT HAS SOPE AND SOPE DOESN'T ABSORB SOPE C TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOPE MAKES IT SO IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH
757,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S THAT HAPPENS
758,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OH WHAT WAS I GONNA CALL IT UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABY BE OUH WHAT WAS THE RE CALLED UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET
759,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED AND WITH THE MAGNETS FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED WITH THE MAGNETS THAT FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL
760,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACES THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT'D BE PRETTY BAD,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLAC THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT W'RE RETTY BAD
761,UM CAUSE IT WOULD JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY LIKE GET LESS AND LESS AND LESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES MMM HMM,UM BECAUSE THIT'D JUST USES UP ALL THE ENERGY LIKE GET LESS AND LESS AND HALESS AND THEN FINALLY IT JUST DIES M HMM
762,UM OH LETS SEE THE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE HAVE NO CLUE YEAH ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS,UM OH LET'S SEE MORE TIGHTELY YOU DID IT I THINK THE MORE I HAVE NO CLUE  YEAH Y ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS
763,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING
764,WELL ELECTROMAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP SINCE THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM,WELL ELECTROMAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SUBSTANCE THEY WERE BUT THEY'RE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT I CALLEM
765,TO TEST THE MORE WRAPS OH YEAH LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN WRAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN WRAPS MY GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN AND THEN FOR FIFTY WRAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS MMM HMM,TO TEST THE MORE WRAPS OH YEAH LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN WRAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHARTE THAT SO FOR TEN WRAPS MIGHT GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN AND THEN FOR FIFTY WRAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS MM HMM
766,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNET YOU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MMM HMM UH HUH,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH THE MAGNET YOU WOULD JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOUD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MM HMM UH HUH
767,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETISM WELL THE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IT CAN AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOASER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO CAUSE THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETWELL THE MAGNET UNET UM THAT IT GE AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET
768,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP WELL PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMSTERS TO PICK UP LE PLACES GARBON HIPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM
769,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S ALL WELL IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICIS AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAG WELL I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT YEAH,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S A  BU SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAGN WELL  I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT'S YEAH
770,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVE IT MORE ENERGY ES CAUSE IT'S CLOSER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT'D BE UH HUH,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY CAUSE IT'S CLOSER T DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT WULD BE MH HMM
771,YEAH BEFORE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PICK ANYTHING UP,YEAH BEFORE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PIKE ANYTHING UP
772,WE TRIED TO SEE DID IT MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE H HOW DOES IT DO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE,WE TRIED TO SEE DIDN'T MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT THE HOW DOESN'T D MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE
773,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY MMM HMM,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE EELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERYM HMM
774,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD'VE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAG UM WELL A ELECTRICITY SO UM,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD HAVE EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAG UM WELL I ELECTRICITY SO UM
775,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,I HAVE TO ATTATCH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
776,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IS NOT LIGHTING UP
777,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A M NOT MAG A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT UP,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A MNOT A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT UP
778,UM SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS,SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT WILL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS
779,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE
780,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCKED MY FINGER,I ATTATCHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN IATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT ARIAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTOUCHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM IT REALLY SHOCKED MY FINGER
781,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE CRONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
782,THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT F IF WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE AND POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM,THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE AND POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM
783,CELLS ARE NINE NINE ARE NINE VOLT BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB M LIGHT UP,CELLS ARE NIN NOT ARE NINE BUL BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
784,THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF,THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
785,THE GREEN AREAS BY OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE UM D CELL AND ON ONE SIDE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S THAT ONE UM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT'S SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND KNOW WHICH ONE WHICH SIDE SWITCHED,THE GREEN ARIAS CLOSE OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE UM D CELL AND ON ONE SIDE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S THAT ONE UM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND KNOW WHICH ONE WHICH SIDE SWITCH
786,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE UM,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CRONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE UM
787,IT LETS THE WIRES GET ENERGY SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE LIGHT IT CAN UM LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES,IT LETS THE WIRES GET ENERGY SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE LIGHT IT CAN UM LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES
788,THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WIRES IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE D CELL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE IT WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE,IF THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY THROUGH THE ELECTRICIY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHT BULB IS IN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WIRES IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE D CELL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE IT WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE

824,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT THAN THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT WIDER THAN THIS ITS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS
825,M WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL CAUSE UM SINCE THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WIDTH ER THEY'RE ALL WIDER,UM WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL BECAUSE UM SINCE THY'REALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GONNA TTHE'RE THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTIN THY THEY'RE ALL DIFFEFERENT U THEY ALL HAV A DIFFERENT WITH OR THEY'RE ALL WIDER
826,WELL WIDENESS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE AND A CIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHER'S JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S WIDER HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FOURTH GRADE THAT IF YOU S IF THAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'LL FLOAT SO WITH THE BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH THE WIDER BOAT CUP BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOAT BETTER AND HOLD MORE PASSENGERS,UM WELL WINES IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE IN A  AS CICIRCULE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHER S JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTOTHER ONE WILL FLOT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S T'S WIDER AND HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOT BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL  IT'LL FLOT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FORTH GRADE THAT IF YOU SIF THAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'L FLOAT SO IL WITH THE BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH E WIDER BO CUP WE MORE BOA THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOT BETTER AND HOLD MORE PASSENGERSERS
827,L FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO SPREAD 'EM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK 'EM TO ALL ONE SIDE ELSE YOU WON'T GET THE ANSWER YOU NEED TO KIND OF SPREAD 'EM EVENLY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS UM MY PARTNER WE HAD THE SAME BOAT THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE HE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURED OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN 'EM OUT,WELL FIRSTOF LL YOU NED TO SPREAD THEM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK EM ALL TO ONE SIDE RLSE YOU WON'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER YOU NEED TO KIND OF SPREAD THEM EVENLY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS UM MY PARTNER WE HAD THE SAME BOATTHE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE WHE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURED IT WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN AM OUNT
828,WELL I'D WELL I'D WELL FIRST I'D LIKE PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNIES IN THEN YOU WANT TO PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YEAH CAUSE YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK CAUSE IF IF EIGHT WITH EIGHT PENNIES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL UM IF THEY IF EIGHT PENNIES SINKS IT THEN THE RESULTS WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES,WELL I'D WELL I'D WELL FIRST I'D LIKE PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNIES IN ANDTHEN YOU ANTO PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU DT YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK AND THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YEAH CAUSE YOU DON'T OUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK CECAUSE IF IF EIGHT IF WITH EIGHT PENNES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL UM IF LIKE IF EIGHT PENNIES SINKS I THEN THE RESULT WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES
829,WELL UM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PENNIES LIKE ALL TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD KIND OF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU EVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST STAY EVEN AND AND AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER,WWELL UM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE P PENNIES LIKE ALL TO  ONE SIDE I WULD KIND AF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU EAVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST STAY EVENVN AND AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER
830,UM I THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAT IT MIGHT SO THAT ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE,UM I  WELL I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAIT MIGHT SO THE OTHER ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE
831,UM WELL THERE ONE H ONE UM CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER S SIDE THERE'S T TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S STARTING TO TIP THAT WAY AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GONNA TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK,UM WELL THRE ONE PE ONE UM CUP IT'S ALL SENTERED SO IT'S EVEN LY SPREAD THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE'S TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S TRING TO TIP THAT WAY AND AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GONNA TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK
832,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HEIGHTS AND ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY WANNA TEST WHICH ONE WILL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATER,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE AN ABOUT HEIGHT AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WAN A TEST WHICH C  ONE WILL WHOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATER
833,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WHOEVER'S TRYING TO TEST IS SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECA SEEING UM IF A SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AND YEAH,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WHOEVER IS TRYING TO TEST IS SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECAUS SEEING UM IF THE SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AN YEAH
834,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A LIKE A KIND OF WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT COULD FILL WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE'S A TON OF WAVES AND IT DID SEE IT TI IT SWIVELS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST STAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST STAY FLAT IF IT THE WATER'S CALM IT WORKS BETTER,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE LIKE A TON OF WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT COULD FILLED WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE IS A TON OF WAVES AND IT H'S ITIT I SWIVELS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST STAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST STAY FLAT AND IF IT THE WATER'S CALM IT IT WORKS BETTER
835,UM WHEN WE MADE THE BOATS WELL WE WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW MANY PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH WATER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF THE WELL NO BUT UM IF LIKE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT,UM WHEN WE MADE THE BOATS WELL WEWE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOWMANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD OR HOW HOW MUCH WATER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF TA  WELL NOW BUT UM IF LIKE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT
836,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF THERE IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME JUST SEE IF IT'LL AFFECT IT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM AND A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A UM SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF IT WAS A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU  CAUSE YOU SOUD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME TO SE IF ITW'L AFECT IT AT'S NOT A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT
837,UH LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH,U LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH
