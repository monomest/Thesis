/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BE TO BEING EATEN

/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY

/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,AS AT FUTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS

/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME

/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
/srv/scratch/z5160268/2020_TasteofResearch/CU_Kids_Corpus/spk-05-062/story/spk-05-062-story.wav,BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
