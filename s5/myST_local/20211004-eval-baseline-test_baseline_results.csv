0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ANL THE WAY TO TWENTY TWO
1,OKAY,AQUE
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,AH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONGRAFTS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPERCLIPSE AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERY ONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HITE THEIR DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEA YEA
4,YEAH,YEA
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,OH PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE A SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE A LENGTH OF THE STRING
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,AH PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE SAW IT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENTS I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YAH A LITTLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEACHER AND WE SO AM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG N THE SMALLEST AND WE ROTE ON ONE TIME IT WAS A LENGTH IN THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE A TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE IAM NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THER LENGTH EN THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SSO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN BECAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY E JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY SAND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS WINGS THAT GOT SO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM OM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESK WERE AT OUR DSK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND THEN ON THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE ON I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT SENEMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT SENIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,AUNT YAUIJ STID GRAFFING TO YESTERDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,AH YES I HAVE ACTUALLY
14,MATH,MARCHING
15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,AQUE
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND TEIT GOT SMALLER AN SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE THE LEAST WINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,IM YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED
19,OKAY,
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WILL YA AT FIRST WE TRWE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD EFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS AM LENGTH AM A STARTING POINT AND THEN AM A IF LIKE THE FORCE SAID THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE HIS FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
21,YEAH,HERE
22,OKAY,
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO IM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP IN A PENNY AND YOU ATTACHED THE STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN I'M THE I I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THE YOU'E GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST WINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN I'M TO MAKE THE THE PENDULUM SWING LAST SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOULL HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YES WE'SED IN PENDULENCE SO LIKE UMWE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BUT BE U BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOMELIKE WE KEPT HAVING THO EXPERIMENT UNTIL EVERY ONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,AGAIN
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YET THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISES PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YEA LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEA
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UN WE WWE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO AN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICKWETS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER WENT TO WHAT HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS IKE THAT SORT OF SO WENT UP INSTEAD UPDOWN
34,UM WE,AMWE
35,WE WERE USING,WE WERE USING
36,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE WE TESTED WITH A DIFFERENT THING IN STUFF
37,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP,AH YEF WE DID THE TESTS WITH THAT GROUPE
38,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES IM WERE HOW FAR OR I HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSHED DOWN THE IM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN FLINKY EDES THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN IM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
39,YEAH,YE
40,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,IN TO GRAPHIT SO YOU KNOW WELL A WELL SI YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED IN WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AM A WHOLE BUNCH OF ADIFFERENT AM EXPERIMENTS IN STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOUTS AME A SOM WHAT ELSE WE DID A FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS
42,YEAH,YA
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THAN WHEN WE WEN THE CUT WHEN WE SHALL THE CLASS HOW TO DO ITSO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MODOR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE
44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOUT HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,I'M JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WE BETTINBUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED OUR DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORKING A CORKING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,THERE A AM THE'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YA IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY TO NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED INSTA
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,AMWE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRASS
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WART WE SHOWED TO THE HOLE CLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,YE AND THEN AFT WELL THEN WE TESTED WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,WELL ACTUALLY THERE IS MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TO ANTED TO
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SURE ECAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER IN STUFF BUTT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFOR ECAUSE WE MADE A RECORING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ASER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY AND WIT SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CAIN IMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT A FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THATS WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHAT WE ADDED ALL THOSE TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YE
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WE ALL CAME UP WITH SPIRI VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS STIN AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW ON HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE EXAXES AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE WHIE AXESS WHEL THE WHI AXES IS RIGHT HERE THE EXCESS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED AND LET SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE WHIE AXES THERE WAS E WELL AND THEN THERE WAS THE COW LONG THE HOW FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR I WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOK
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAFT  DON'T KNOW WHAN IT TO CALLED STILL BUT OM WE IT WAS THERE AS AN EX AXIS IN A WIAXIS THE EX AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE WIAXIS WAS WHIT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND NOU
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE WYAXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALLUMIN BALL IN THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAT OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WAG THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEYTHEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL THA
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,AND THEN WELL SO SEND SIXES ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTILL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT AN MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RI BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE AN WE GOT THE STICK AND WHEN SHE CHOSE TO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO AN I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LO AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAV IS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY INTO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT OPPOSITE
63,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WAS IT ONE OF THEM SO
64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,TAT WAS FURTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,U IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH SUM ER IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS OR THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FOR THROT WAGGA
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,WE MADE PLAINS THAT LOOKED LIKE DE
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HADE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPSE JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLATE SO I BEG TO HAVE THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER ITS GOING TO GET THAN BORE THE MORE SPENCE OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TO DAY WE DIDN'T WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD SCIENCE AND THEN PEAN THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YA AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TREATED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK A TUSE WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALF WEYMARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE JUST JUST GUESS TWHAT NUMBER
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YAN THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIENCE MEANT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST AND TO US CAUSE THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT A SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO PETE SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO
71,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN NO THAT WOULD BE COOL
72,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETE FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOUR METERS,WHICH IS A HUNDRED SEDEMETER FOUR HUNDRED TENMETERS IS FORTY
73,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,T ACT LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT ELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY OH
74,YEAH,B
75,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YA WERE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE OR NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WWERE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WERE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ONOH YAW WE'RES KEEPING FORTY SPINS  WE'RE JUST TRYING FORTY SPINS THIS THE REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
76,YEAH YEAH,YE  YE
77,YEAH,YE
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLANS CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY THAT I WANT THE SWINGERS CAUSE WE HAVE THIS VARIABLE'S BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS A A WOMAN DOING  A LIKE I PICKED AHEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPERING OFF THE WHO SHE WAS DOING A BAULT AND I DO WALT LIKE I TAKE DMASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IS REALLY FUN THOUGH
79,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GOSAID LIKE AH YA FOR METERS
80,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN AS LIKE SO YOU GO ROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETET AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOU THING YET ONE TO LIKE YE AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY TESTED IT LIKE ONCE
81,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PARTED FROM THE BOTTOM IT WULD JUST SO THAT WAS SLOPE A ONE WAS UMWAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MABBY THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED
82,I DON'T KNOW,IR ES
83,OH YOU'RE WELCOME OKAY,EO QA H
84,HELLO,CLOUD
85,YEAH YEAH,YE YE
86,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,OH THE AH THER AR FLINGERS THE FLFERS AND THE WE BEEARE THERE A THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AS SOUND
87,YEP,HE
88,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO HO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING IT AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWAY SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE N ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KI I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE,YE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALF WAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO WHWE TRIED TO DO A WE WERE WEERE JUST HASTING ATE AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE OM SWAT SPINSE AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AN WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KINDHING I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAY BE
89,GLIDER THE PROPELLER THING,GLIDER TE PROPELLER THING
90,YEAH WE GET TO USE IT AND S CAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FANS SO AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND IT GOES IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT'S WE'RE DOING S LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHER'S UM ARM SPANS LIKE WING SPAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN SO,YA WE GET TO USE IT AND CASE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FAN SO AND NOW WARGRANA TRI THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND A GA IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT A IT WE'RE DOING LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHERS ON ARMED  SPANS LIKE WINGS PAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN EN WITH THE FAN
91,YEAH YEAH AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE DOING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THE OUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING UM SLOPE,E AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE TOING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THAT OUR VARIABLES WERE AM LIKE TIGHTNESS OP THE STRING ON SLOPE

121,UH LESS BECAUSE THIS E IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND IT ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND,AH LESS BECAUSE THIS ITS SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS IN THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED FIVE MELLED LEADERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER NA ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLE LEADERS OF WATER AND TA'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND
122,AND THEN PASSENGERS,AND THEN PASSENGERS
123,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N E CAUSE MY K PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FI SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE IT'S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN UP HERE YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE,AND THEN SO AN WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S AND E CAUS MIKE PARTNER WAS NATON SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE SENTIMADE OR ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LI I DON'T REMEMBER ALL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WITH SEVENTY FA SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE STRAIGHT HERE WAS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN OFWE YES AND THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE
124,YEAH,YE
125,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID A WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VOTES AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF VOTES LIKE IDID A FIVE THAT WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
126,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY UM IT WAS JU THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY ONCE WOULD  UM THERE WAS JUST THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I NO
127,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,O O K SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TO DAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN
128,NO,HE NEP
129,OH YOU CAN HAVE IT,OH YOU CAN HAVE IT
130,YEAH CAUSE LIKE,YA CUSLIK
131,YEAH,YAIR
132,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAPH A LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO,AH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAFE LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFFTALE
133,IT WAS LIKE A PAGE WE GOT,OS LIKE A PAGE WE GOT
134,LIKE PROBABLY,LIKE PROBABLY
135,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOUGH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL AND LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE,AH YAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAFFIT WAS CALLED THO BUT WE LIKE WWITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL LIKE ON THE GRAFT WE GRAFT WITH  LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE THE SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MELILADERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY A PASSENGERS I GOT SO YES WA SHER
136,WE PUT EM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN THEY WERE OUR PASSENGERS,WE PUT HIM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN NO WITHOUT THEY WERE OUR PASSENGERS
137,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE USO NA YOU
138,YEAH,YET
139,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN AND WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S E N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY,AY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND  WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE AS AS THE EN AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENT A METR BEAT WE GOT A HUNDRED FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN I WAS OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN WAS  YA LIKE ARMOIT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PALASI
140,YEAH,
141,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PR YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS,WELL YOU HAVE BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS ON MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE YOU AT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTION
142,AND THEN,AND THEN WHY DID YOU PIGE LOURS
143,YEAH,YES
144,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE BOATS WE STERTALY MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS A ECBLE LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTOETERS AND THEN A WE DID THAT BECAUSE A WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A CYRANGE INTO IT AND THEN SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SARANGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRATULATED EN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURE AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
145,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH OH O KAY THAT O CA THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING NEW SO A WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO A TO EFFECT THAT EFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND PUT IT IN BECAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOE THE END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
146,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING
147,YEAH,YES
148,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DID THIS WAS OUR TWO SAID AN METER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PAF A WE DIDN'T RELI TO TO TREASON YAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS
149,YEAH,HERE
150,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,ABN WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO CALLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR AH YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO
151,BOATS I THINK WHAT LI UM,ROUT I THINK WHAT I AM
152,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,WE A HA WE DID WE LIKE I SORT OF FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THEREAS WE TALKD ABOT A LATIN OT THING AND
153,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME,BUT THEY'RE NOT SAME
154,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE SANMETER ROATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOATNUMER THREE AND LIKE THER IT WAS A HUGE RAIN OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
155,YEAH,
156,UM YEAH,UN YE
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,AMBECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE SAINT  ORHOLL CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOMEAN GE FUNFINDIN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DAND FOR TO THE PENNIES AND LIKE WIT THE THREE SENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,YE PROUD OFTE YES YER
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTM WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME SO
160,YEAH,HE
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YA E BECAUSE DO YOU WANT TO FIND WE WANT TO HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR YOUR EXPERIEMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOUOD DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANT TO KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO AN END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN AR OR THAR OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A AM ALL IN ALL AM MO A A THREE SENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLVED TWELVE SEND TWELVE PENNIES
162,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME SE'S OVER THERE YE UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD THE LESS NO LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TO DAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS LOVED LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENT A METER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES AND I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN THAN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM
163,I DON'T KNOW,LEDONO
164,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE SATURATED SOLUTION SOMETHING LIKE THAT NO THE START OVER,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRIM TO LEFT UP THE THE SAID RED O SOMETHING NOTHER START
165,IT SATURATES,ITS TET YOR FITS
166,IT RISES,IT RISES
167,GOOD,GOOD
168,I DON'T KNOW,I DED NOT
169,YOU POURED THE SALT AND IT GOES TO THE BOTTOM THEN YOU SHAKE IT AND IT DISSOLVES,ME FOR THE SULG ID NA GO THE BOTTOM AND YO SHADIN OURSELVES
170,I DON'T KNOW,BUTTER THAN I
171,THERE'S WATER IN THE BOTTLE AND YOU PUT THE SALT IN THE WATER TIL IT'S,THERE IS O WATER IN THE BOTTLE IN TE EN YOU GE READY AHIL NOW MY ONCE BUT THE SAU IN THE WATER UNTILL IT RIGHT OUT WHY OW NO I
172,WE PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER AND MIXED IT UP UNTIL IT WAS SAT,WE PUT THIS SOUNT INTO THE WAND MIXED IT UP UNTIL IT WAS SET
173,UM,A
174,THE WATER IS SATURATING,THE WATER SATURAED
175,THING,THING
176,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE AND WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEN THEN YOU SHAKE IT AND SAW THE WATER RISE,AND WE BUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE AN WE PUT ONE SPOON ASALT INTO T E FIFTY MILLE EATERS OF WATER  THEN WE SHAKED IT AND SALEMN WATER RISE
177,IT TAKES LONGER FOR THE EPSOM SALT TO DISSOLVE,ME IT TAKES LONGER FOR THE ABSENCE OUGHT TO DISSOLVE
178,AND SIX SPOONS OF SUGAR IT MAKES THE WATER SATURATED,AT SIX SPOONS OF SUGAR IT MAKES THEM WATER CETERATE
179,SOMETHING,O A SOMETHING
180,THERE'S SALT,ISHSALT
181,GOOD,THA
182,THE THE SALT SOLUTION WEIGHTS SEVENTEEN GRAMS MORE THAN THE THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER,THE THE SULT SUBLUTION WAGHES SEVENTEEN GRAMS MORE THAN THE THEN THE FIFTEE MILLE LEADERS OF WATER
183,BY ADDING,BY ADDING FOOL
184,THERE'S FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION AND THERE IS FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF THE SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE,THERE'S FIFTY MILL LEADERS OF SALT SALUTION AND THERE IS FIFTY MILL LEADERS OF WATER IN THE FIFTY MILL LEADERS OF THE SALT SALUTION WAYSMORE
185,I HAVE NO IDEA,HAVE AN IDEA
186,I'M NOT SURE,I'M NOT SURE
187,I DON'T KNOW WHAT,AND TE OUT TO SPEAKEEA DRY PT O IS NOT SOM I DUNNO I WHAT

195,NOT SURE,I'M NOT SURE
196,I HAVE NO IDEA,I'VE NO IDEA
197,THE CITRIC ACID CITRIC ACID AND EPSOM SALT ARE BEING MIXED INTO THE WATER,THE SETRI ACID SACI ACID AND THE ESPIN SALT ARE BEING MIXED INTO THE WATER
198,THAT IT TELLS US WHAT'S IN IT,THAT IT TELLS THAT WID IN IT
199,IT TOOK FOUR SCOOPS FROM THE SALT TO SATURATE THE WATER AND IT TOOK THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT TO SATURATE THE OTHER,IT TOOK FOUR SKINS FROM THE SATRIC SAL TO SATURATE THE WATER AND TORK THREE COOPS OF SBEEN SOUGHT TO SATURATE THE OTHER

865,WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS IT'S JUST,WE DIDN'T DO THE SAN CLASS ATS TRIS
866,B L T,V L T
867,UM WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS IS JUST BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE,WAITED ITO THE SO CLASS THIS WAS JUST BACK OUR KNOWLEDGE
868,BUT WE HAD GROUPS OF FOUR,BUT WE HAD GROUPS OF FOUR
869,HELLO,HELO
870,OR A MICROWAVE,OR A MICER WAY
871,NOT REALLY,NOT REALLY
872,AND THEN WE PUT IT OUR HUNDRED GRAMS INTO ONE BIG BAG,AND THEN WE PUTED OUR HUNDRED GAME IT ONE BIG BAG
873,UH A D A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS,AH A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRIMS
874,OKAY LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A STEEL BALL JUST COMPLETELY CIRCULAR STEEL BALL AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND THEN A VASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOWL SO THE WHEN THE WATER FALLS OUT IT'LL GO INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL INTO THE WATER MOST OF THE YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WATER'S IN IT THOUGH FOR THIS TO WORK WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL IN WHEN THE WATER COMES OUT AS MUCH WATER IS STILL IN THE VASE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S IN IT BECAUSE IT PUSHES IT OUTWARD UNTIL IT'S SETTLED,O CAT LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A STEEL BALL JUST COMPLETELY CIRCULAR STEEL BALL AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND THEN A VASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOL SO WHEN THE WATER FALLS OUT  GO INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL INTO THE WATER MOST YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WATER IS EN IT THE FOR THIS TO WORK WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL IN UT WHEN THE WATER COMES OUT AS MUCH WATER IS STELL IN THE VASE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S IN IT BECAUSE IT PUSHES IT OUTWARD UNTIL IT'S SETTLED
875,WHAT HAVE WE WORKED ON THIS WEEK WELL THIS WEEK THE IN THE THREE DAYS IN THIS WEEK WE'VE WORKED ON MEASUREMENT AND MASS,WHAT HAVE WE WORKED ON THIS WEEK WELL THIS WEEK THE IN THE THREE DAYS IN THIS WEEK WE'VE WORKED ON MEASUREMENT AND MASS
876,UH HUH OR LEVEL,POOR LEVEL
877,HOW THAT WORKS IS IT'S LIKE A PRESS,HOW THAT WORKS IS ITS LIKE A PRESS
878,I KNOW AS IN LIKE KILL A GRAM,I KNOW TO SUNLY KILL E A GRAM
879,HOW DO I MEASURE MASS WITH THE BOWL AND THE THE UM VASE AND THE STEEL BALL OR OR ANYTHING YOU WANT LIKE AN ORANGE OR,I MEASURE MASS WITH THE BALL IN THUM TUM THESE IN THE STEEL WALL OR OR ANYTHING YOU ANT LIKE AN ORINGER
880,YOU HAVE TO DEPEN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON,YOU HAVE TO DEPEND IN DEPEND ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON
881,WE PUT IN TEN OF THOSE,WE PUT IN TEN OF THOSE
882,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED
883,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQULES A KILDRIM
884,GRAMS YEAH OH I JUST THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE,GRAHAMS YE OH I JUST SUC YOU MEAN THE
885,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHING IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP,I SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHIN TIS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP
886,HA IT WEIGHED LIKE TWENTY,IT WAIGHED LIKE TWENTY
887,THAT THAT WOULD BE WAIT JUST A SEC,THAT THAT WOULD BE WAGES TO C
888,SEVEN SEVEN INCHES,SEVEN SEVEN INCHES
889,PROBABLY THE MASS,PROBABLY THE MASK
890,AND THAT ADDED UP IN TO TWO HUNDRED,AND THAT I OUNTED UP IN TO TWO HUNDRED
891,WE HAD A SCALE,WE HAD A SCALE
892,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME
893,YES,YES
894,IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE MORE HEAVY,IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE MORE HEAVY
895,MMM HMM AND THEN PUT THEM INTO A ONE BIG BAG AND THEN IT EQUALED ONE KILOGRAM,AND THEN PUT THEM INTO ONE BIG BAG NEVER EQUALED ONE KILLED THEM
896,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF A TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WHEN IT'S ON,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NIGHT WHEN IT WAS ON
897,NO BECAUSE ALL PA THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE IT'D BE SMALL,NO BECAUSE OU PAE THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPSE BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE SHOULD BE SMALL
898,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MATH MASS IS WITH WATER O A BOWL AND A VASE,HOW DO YOU MEAS YOURE MOUTH MASS IS WITH WATER A BOWL AND A VASE
899,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRAM PIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OUR GRAM PIECES WE MEASURE LIKE E THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE GRAM PIECES,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRANDPIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OUR GRANDPIECES WE MEASURE LIKE THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE RANDPIECES
900,WELL THE MASS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASS THAT THESE TAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT QUARTERS OF THIS TABLE,WELL THE MASS OF SOMETHINGIS LIKE THE MASS THAT THIS TAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT QUARTERS OF THIS TABLE
901,YES,YES
902,SO IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SI SIX SIX FIVE GRAMS,SO IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SIX SIX SIX FIVE GRAMS
903,BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE RIGHT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE RIGHT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
904,FALLS OUT,FALLS OUT
905,NO TEN HUNDRED GRAMS,NO TEN HUNDRED GRAMS
906,TODAY,TO DAY
907,YEAH AND WE EACH MADE FIFTY GRAMS,YE AND WEAT YOU TO MADE FIFTY GRAMS
908,YEAH YEAH LIKE UM LET'S SAY A TOASTER,YE YE LIKE EM LET SAY A TOAST ER
909,ESTIMATING IS LIKE A GUESS,ESTIMATING IS LIKE GUESS
910,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT
911,WE CAN USE A GRAM PIECE FOR MEASUREMENT,YOU CAN USE A GRAN PIECE FOR MEASUREMENT
912,HOW I DID IT,HOW I DID DID
913,AND THE HEAVIEST ONE WAS THE LUG NUT,AND THE HEAVIEST ONE WAS THE LUGNUT
914,GRAMS,GRAHAMS
915,I DID THAT IN MY HOMEWORK,I DID THAT IN MY HOMEWICK
916,E THEY HAD THIS LITTLE WHITE BAR AND THEN THIS PIECE THAT GOT POKED OUT FROM THE INSIDE OUT NOT LIKE A HOLE BUT LIKE E IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT LIKE THE INSIDE OF IT LIKE THAT'S THE REGULAR INSIDE OF IT AND THEN IT'S LIKE THAT,THERE HE HAD THIS LITTLE WHITE BAR AND THEN THIS PIECE THAT GOT POKED OUT FROM THE INSIDE OUT NOT LIKE A HOLE BUT LIKE IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT LIKE THE INSIDE OF IT LIKE THAT THE REGULAR INSIDE OF IT ANTHAT IT'S LIKE THAT
917,THEY MIGHT THINK BELIEVE ME BUT IF THEY'RE SMART THEY WOULDN'T,THEY MIGHT SING BELIEVE ME BUT IF THERE'S MART THEY WOULDN'T
918,YES WHY THAT'S HELPFUL IS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS,YES IWAS WHY LET'S HELP US TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS
919,HOW MIGHT THAT HAPPEN IS BE JUST BECAUSE PHYSICS,HOW MIGHT THAT HAPPEN ITS BE JUST BECAUSE PHYSICS
920,WE WERE MEASURING TEMPERATURE WITH A THERMOMETER,WERE MASRING TEMPERATURE WITH TH THERMOMETER
921,IT DOESN'T FREEZE LIKE EXACTLY THEN LIKE,IT DOESN'T FREEZE LIKE EXACTLY THEN LIKE
922,BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS OUR LAST DAY OF MEASUREMENT,BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS OUR LAST DAY OF MITERMENT
923,OVER TIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE ICE STARTED TO MELT,OVERTIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE EYES STARTED TO MELT
924,THAT'S THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS,THAT'S THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS
925,IS IT ALWAYS ENDS UP IN A THOUSAND,IS IT ALWAYS ENDS UP IN A THOUSAND
926,WELL I WON'T BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE AN ENTOMOLOGIST,WELL I WON'T BECAUSE I OMY AN ATEMOLOGIST
927,WE WE MEASURED LIKE WATER,WE WE MEASURED LIKE WATER
928,THEY'RE LIKE THAT,THEY'RE LIKE THAT
929,BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT WITH FREEZING,BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING I WITH FREEZINGG
930,PUT IT IN A KETTLE,PUT IN A CATTLE
931,METER TAPE,MEDOR TA
932,UM NOT REALLY NO BECAUSE IT'S S JUST ALL OF IT IS PHYSICS,I' NOT REALIAN NO BECAUSE IT'S JUST ALL  ITIS PHYSICS
933,A IS THE HOTTEST B IS THE COLDEST COLD OVERWHELMS HOT,A IS THE HOTTEST BES THE COLDEST COLD OVER WALMS HOT

935,YES,YES
936,I'LL HOLD IT,I'LL HOLD IT
937,CELSIUS TIME,SALSER TIME
938,THE ICE WAS MELTING AND WHEN THE ICE MELTS THE ICE TURNS INTO COLD WATER BUT AFTER THAT WHEN THE ICE WOULD'VE MELTED TWO TIMES IT TURNS INTO C IT TURNS INTO HOT WATER,THE ICE WAS MELTING AND WHEN THE ICE MELTS THE ICE TURNS INTO COLD WATER BUT AFTER THAT WHEN THE ICE WOULD HAVE MELTED TWO TIMES IT TURNS INTO IT TURNS INTO HOT WATER
939,HELLO,HELLO
940,THIS IS A LINE GRAPH AND THIS I MEANS THAT THIS WAS,THIS IS A LIN GRAPH AND VIS IT I MEANS THAT THIS WAS

997,WELL THEY ALWAYS USE FAHRENHEIT SO IT'S NOT CELSIUS,WELL THEY ALWAYS USE FERENHEITS O IT'S NOT SELSIEST
998,YES THE DEGREES OF CELSIUS YES,YES THE DEGREES OF SELSIES YES
999,OR AT SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE THE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU PUT IN IT,OR SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICY PLURDICED
1000,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S HA GONNA HAPPEN IS B'S ACTUALLY GONNA OVERCOME THE A,THER MAXSING A AN B WHICH IS FIVE CELIS AN THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREE SELCIES IN WHAT'S OUT GOING TO HAPPEN IS B IS ACTUALLY NO OVERCOME THE A
1001,NO SH WE JUST LOOKED AT THE CLOCK,NO S WE JUST LOOKED AT THE COCK

1003,CELSIUS,ELSIE
1004,CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT,SELSIEST AND FARENITE
1005,YEAH,YE
1006,WHAT WE DID WAS WE POURED ICE INTO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERO IT TURNED INTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE NEGATIVE FIVE CELSIUS COLDER,WHAT HE DID WAS E PORD ICE IN TO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERA TURNEINTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE AND I GET UT FIVE SIL SIX COLDER
1007,ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAPH YOU HAVE CELSIUS AND THIS YOU HAVE TIME IN MINUTES,ON THIS SIDE OTEGRAPH YE HAVE SELSIUS AND THIS YE HAVE TIME AND MINUTE
1008,AND THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AND THEN MINUTES AFTER ONE M MINUTE IT W IT WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES,AN THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AN THE DMINUTES AFTER ONE MINUTE IT WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES
1009,UH HE'S GONNA DIP IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT FRIES CIRCUITS AND THEN HE DIE,ND HE DIN A DIP IT INSIGHT OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WORD HAPPEN AS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT FRIED CIRCUIS AND THEN HE DIED
1010,IT'S BEEN ON FOR A WHILE,IT'S BEEN ON FOR A WHILE
1011,IT'S N IT'S A PRETTY SMALL LE AMOUNT SEE THIS,IT'S IT'S A PRETTY SMALL WHY I'M OUT  SEE THIS
1012,YEAH YEAH LIKE THIS,YE Y LIKE THIS
1013,TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE WE PUT TWO KILOGRAMS BAGS ON TWO KILOGRAM BRICKS ONTO IT,TWO THOUSAND BUT BECAUSE WE PUT TWO KILAGRAM BAGS LAT TWO KILGRAN BRICKS ONTO
1014,THEY HAVE MILLILITERS IN THEM,THEY HAVE MILL LEADERS IN THE
1015,WELL THE VIALS WELL W THE VIALS COULD DO IS THEY'D LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS,WELL THE VIALS WHAT THE VIALS COULD DO IS DAYE LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS
1016,IT WASN'T TWO HUNDRED GRAMS BECAUSE THERE WAS FROM WATER UM I FORGOT WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE DID DO,LISM TWO UNDERGROUNDS BECAUSE IT WAS RAY FROM WATER ON I FORGET WHAT IS CALLED BUT WE DID DO
1017,NO,HES NOUT
1018,YEAH,
1019,MILLILITER IS LIKE A GRAM IN LIQUID,MILL LEADERS LIKE A GRAHAM IN LAQUIS

1022,YEAH,
1023,YEAH WE USED SOME VIALS,YAWLY YOU SOME BLILES
1024,YES IT WAS TWO HUNDRED,YES YEAS CUR
1025,UM NOT E NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK IS WE FILLED UH BABY DIAPER WITH WATER AND IT GOT LIKE REALLY BIG YEAH SERIOUSLY,IM NOT NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THHOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK AS WE FILLED A BABY DIPRIRL WITH WATER AND I GOTLY GRILLY BIG YES SERIOUSLY
1026,MMM HMM NO NO WE USED UM ROCKS,NO NO WE USED UM ROTS
1027,IN THE METRIC SYSTEM,IN THE NATHING SYSTEM
1028,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OF LIQUID BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO IT FOR OR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE LEMONADE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OR SIMIL OR LE LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THERE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT A LEMONADE STAND AND ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THEY WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MATERAN O I IN  I  DO IT FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUAD BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE LEMONATE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STAND IN MEASUREMENT OR SOMEWAT OR LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THEE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT ELEMONADE STAND AND THE ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THA WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT

1030,IT WOULD TAKE,IT WOULD TAKE
1031,NO IT WAS UP TO D,NO OSUP TO DEE
1032,NOT REALLY,NOT REALLY
1033,IT'S NOT A METER IT'S A UM SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE LITER IT'S,ITS NOT A METER ITSAY U SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE GLETERANCE
1034,WHEN WE WEIGHED STUFF IN LIQUID IN LIQUID OR WHAT SOLIDS WE USED GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAW THAT UM TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE KILOGRAM IS A THOUSAND GRAMS,WHEN WE WASTE STUFF AND LIQUID PIPLY QUITTER WAT SOLID WE USE GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAWS THAT ON TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS FOR THE MEANS THAT OULN KILIGRAM MISSUS SOUSFOM GRAMS
1035,WELL A LITER IS A THOUSAND,WHILE A LEADER IS A SOUSE AND
1036,YEAH MILLILITER HOW I REMEMBER THAT IS THE MILLA IS THE LITER IS THE M KING OF THE MILLILITERS,GAMILLA LEADER HOW I REMEMBER THAT IS THE MILL IS THE LEADER IS THE KING O THE MILLO LEADERS
1037,LIKE A SURGICAL NEEDLE,LIKE A CERGICAL NEEDLE
1038,WITH THE PLUNGER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON IT EACH PLUNGER FULL IS FIFTY,WITH A PLUNDER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON EACH PLUNDERFUL IS FIFTY
1039,YEAH,
1040,WELL WHAT WE DID WAS THIS,WELL WHAT WE DID WAS THIS
1041,IT WAS JUST TWO HUNDRED UH NOT TWO HUNDRED LITERS TWO HUNDRED,IT AS TWO HUNDRED AND NOT TWO HUNDRED LEADERS TWO HUNDRED
1042,WELL WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH LITERS IS THE LITERS,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH THE LEADERS IS THE LEADERS
1043,HI COOPER,ACUPER
1044,IT'S LIKE A HOLDING A THOUSAND REINS RAISINS IN YOUR HAND RAISINS,IT'S LIKE HOLDING A THOUSAND RAINS RAGASES IN HER HAND RAISINS
1045,YEAH,NEAR
1046,THEN THERE'S A HUNDRED IN THAT CUP,THEN TEAR THE SAMTING
1047,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOILET PLUNGER LIKE A DA LIKE A UH NEEDLE THING LIKE YEAH YEAH LIKE,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOIL IT PLUNGER LIKE A DOT LIKE A A NEEDLE THING LIKE SYE YA LIKE
1048,GET IT WEIGHED AT LEAST IT WEIGHED TWO KILOGRAMS,WAT AT LEAST IT WAT TWO KILEGRAMS
1049,WELL IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING LIQUID GRAMS WEIGHT,WHILE IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING WIKUID BRAM WAIT
1050,A GRAM IS ABOUT ONE RAISIN,AGRAM IS ABOUT ONE REASON
1051,UM EXCEPT FOR THE PLUNGER NOT REALLY,AM EXCEPT FOR THE PLUNGER NOT REALLY
1052,THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE METRIC SYSTEM,THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE METRIC SYSTEM
1053,UM NO,AN NO
1054,YEAH,
1055,PRETTY GOOD,PRETTY GOOD
1056,TENS,AN
1057,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW HOW MANY UM,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW AT HELM MANY OM
1058,I FEEL HOT AIR COMING OFF OF THIS VENT,I FEEL HOT AIR COMING OF FOR THIS VENT
1059,UH A FULL DIAPER WITH ALL OF WATER,A A FOOL BIPE WITH ALL OF WATER
1060,YEAH AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY IT'D FILL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY MMM TWO HUNDRED,YE AND IWE SAW HOW MANY IT TIVLOPED TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED
1061,SO MMM HMM,SO MER
1062,HMM OKAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO,HUM I'L CET WHILE WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO
1063,JUST A SEC YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NINE,DRETETA SICK YAM PRETTY SURE IT'S MINE
1064,NOT A LITTLE WHILE JUST PRETTY BY YEAH,NOT A LITTLE WHILE JUST PRETTY CLOSE
1065,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
1066,MMM HMM N MMM,AAH
1067,WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER,WHAT THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MAJORMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A MEATER
1068,EH A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS UP AND DOWN,E A HUNDRED SANAMETRS THAT WAS ABOUT THAT UP AND DOWN
1069,PROBABLY THIS OF CENTIMETER,PROBABLY THIS OF SANEMEDE
1070,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE IN MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH
1071,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAW ON THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAD TO TAPE THEM E TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER,WELL IT WASN'T THE HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO A DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAWN THE NUMBERS BUT T WE HAD TO TAPE LUM AND TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADTED IN THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER
1072,YOU HAVE HAVE TO ESTIMATE HOW BIG YOU ARE,YOU HAVE TO ETIMATE HOW BIG YOU ARE
1073,ES YES WE HAVE,AS YES WE HAVE
1074,NO WE HAVEN'T USED IT YET,NO HE HASN'T USED IT YET
1075,YEAH WE MADE OUR METER TAPE,A WE MADE OUR METER TAPE
1076,A CENTIMETER IS TEN METERS,I SEND TO METERS TEN METERS
1077,MMM HMM I WONDER WHERE THAT YELLOW BALL WENT OKAY,E I WONDER WHERE THAT YELLOW BALL WENT WHY OUC
1078,OH YEAH,A GAM
1079,THERE WERE TEN YEAH,THERE WERE TEN GAP
1080,EVERY TEN WE COLORED IT A DIFFERENT COLOR,EVERY TEN WE COLORED ID A DIFFERENT COLOR
1081,WHAT WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANSWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE Y WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU G IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,WHET WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW IT AND SIR WHEN YOU'RE LIKE WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IBECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU IF YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT YOU NOTHER YOU GOT I WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIN'T DO
1082,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING
1083,BUT USUALLY THEY HAVE LIKE MEASURING TAPES THERE,BUT USUALLYDAY YO HAV LIKE MEASURING TAPESER
1084,WHAT KINDA THINGS DID I ESTIMATE,WHAT I TO THINK TAT I ASKED TO ME
1085,OH YEAH IT WAS THE STRAW ONE,ALL TE OUT IT WAS THE STRAW ONE
1086,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE AS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OLARS AN THE OTHER GLASS MADE NON AT THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS IN THEIR DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM
1087,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYIG MEASUREMENT AMOUNTS TO HIM
1088,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WHILE THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FALL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS
1089,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MASS TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MASTH CLASS

1094,NO EVERY TEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,NO EVERY TAIN IT WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR
1095,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MY INSTRUMENT YES LI RAT PIECS OF DUST
1096,NO,NOW
1097,YEAH,OR
1098,YEAH YARD STICK IS JUST LIKE THAT BIG AND YEAH,YA A YARDSTICK IS JUST LIKE THAT BIG AND
1099,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE WE HAD TO MEASURE IT
1100,WE WE IN TODAY'S MATH STUMPER WE WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS L ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS,E WE IN TO DAY'S MAST STUMPER WA WE TO E SAID AK THE MADE E SAID ASKE THE MAD WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS LET ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS
1101,NO BOTH WAYS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETER OH NOT THE PERIMETER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YEAH YEAH,NO BOTH UT MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND LEN PEREMETER I NOT THE PERMER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YET I DON'T REMEMBER LENGTH YET YET
1102,HOW MANY CENTIMETERS JUST A SEC A HUNDRED,HOW MANY SENT TOMETERS JUST THE SEC A HUNDRED
1103,WELL H H I WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG,WELL I WEN IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU ARE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG
1104,WELL WELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS,WHAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS ON SANIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS
1105,YEAH,GAN
1106,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT CIE STRAWS
1107,WAIT NINE,WAY NINE
1108,JUST A LITTLE SLEEVE,FOLY
1109,THOSE MARKS WERE FOR A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,THOSE MARKS WERE FOR OF STANDARD MEASUREMENT
1110,A THOUSAND,A THOUSAND
1111,A HUN A HUNDRED YEAH AND THAT EQUALS A THOUSAND MMM HMM,HUND HUNDRED YAYA AND DATY QOLLS A TOUSAN AND THE SICK AS O THOUSAND S
1112,OKAY,OKIN
1113,THOUSAND,THOUSAND
1114,NO A HUNDRED MILLILITERS,NO A HUNDRED NOBEN LEADERS
1115,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LITER TEN OF THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUALS ONE LITER,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LEADER TUNER THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES IT GOES ONE LEADER
1116,WE HAD A LOT OF WATER INTO IT,HE HAD A LOT OF WATER INTO IT
1117,A HUNDRED MILLILITERS,A HUNDRED MEMELEDERS MILL
1118,WELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER WE HAD,WHELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGAR CONTENER WE HAD
1119,TWO,TILL
1120,TEN,HAND
1121,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,IT'S THE LENGH BETWEEN TWO OCHANS I DON'T I DON'T ONLY REMEMBER BULYA
1122,IS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT,ITWAS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STAND OR MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE OURPEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL GUI THAT
1123,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REAL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTOR'S USE YEAH,EU WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER  OT LIGREEL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTORS USE O WIT ISSRYA
1124,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING A PLAY WITH THE WATER
1125,THAT IT TAKE UP YEAH IT'S LIKE GALLONS,DET IT TAKE CURTYES I GALLANT
1126,MAYBE A HUNDRED,MAY BE HUNDE
1127,A HUNDRED,I'LL BE RIGHT THROUGH A HUNDRED
1128,A HUN TEN,OHTE
1129,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE WERE MASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LEADER
1130,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S ABOUT IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE AT WOULDN'T WORK
1131,THESE TWO AND THESE TWO ARE THE SAME,THESE TWO AND THESE TOWARD THE SAME
1132,UH WHAT THE BECAUSE OF THE METRIC SYSTEM,AH WHAT THE MECOUSILMETRIC SYSTEM
1133,NOT A THOUSAND GRAMS YEAH A THOUSAND MILLILITERS,MODESELFS FOM THE GRND A THOUSAND YELLOW YES ASAN NOBI

1150,AND BY OUT,CLOTHE OUT
1151,YES,YES
1152,YOU'RE MEASURING THE WEIGHT OF IT,EMATURING WEIGHT OF IT
1153,DOESN'T LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE A SPOON NO,TOS NOT PRERY RO HOWNESS BOON IS THAT YOUR BIG NO
1154,WELL UM WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE,WELL I WHAT I LIKE MENTIONING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE
1155,LITER,LEADER

1158,A THOUSAND,A THOUSAND
1159,SOME DID SOME DIDN'T,SOME DAY IN PLUMDAY
1160,BECUE WHY I LIKE THE SCALE,P WHILE LIKE THE SKILL
1161,NO MILLILITERS,NO MILLOW EATERS
1162,MMM HMM A HUNDRED,IRTAKE TO MAKE TO FILL UP THIS  A HUNDRED
1163,AND WE SQUIRT SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS ARE LIKE THAT BIG,AND WE S SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNDER COULD FAIL IN STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TOO BECAUSE THE VIOLES ARE LIKE THAT
1164,IS TEN,IS TEN
1165,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
1166,TEN OR MAYBE MORE YEAH,ANIT MAY BE LOSYOU
1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,SHERMEN OF WHET WATER OR WHAT
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASE SOME MOR BATTERYIS AM LAKE LAKE THIR LAKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUNUNDE WINTS IT PICKED UP THE DEWASHESKT TWO BATTER
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,WHER AWENIR CHRISTMAR THE LITA HAS MORE THERES OFOR
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,AVREPEAT THAT AGAIN
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MARE Y RAPID AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENAGY GETS FORCED
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSE URGRE UM AN T IT CONNECTS THE WASHER STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TOOK IT IT DOES
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINESSED THE LINE TO SEVEN O ME TO TEN ONES UM I'D JO SET BEFORE ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT ISCOVERS WHEN I PUT HER A WRAPPIN WORE OF THE WIRE ROUND IT A EAT A MORM A WASHER STICK TO IT
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,AM AS ITS ATTACHED TO THIRTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN I PUTA HUNDRED WINDS ON  PICKED UP THE TIN WASHES BEB BEFORE THEY ONLY PICKED UP I PICKED P TON WASHES INSTEAD OF FISTIN WASHERS TO A ADDING UP A FIVE MORE
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,HE LIES WRAPED AROUND ER A RIVET
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,AM INCREASE WHEN I DESI A PICKED UP TO LOWER AS ONNOT PUT ER UP THE THIRTY I PICKED UP AT THE SWAIT A OPENING BUT IT TO HUNDRED WINS I HAD THESE PICKED UP THIRTY WASH
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,I ALREADY RELATES HI
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,WHAT THE PRAYIN IS THERE'S ASK MUST BE ANY OPEN CIRCUNS AH A IT HAS TO BE I AIS CLOSER TO EVERYTHN
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO DECAILS WORK WITH THE AVERSE WEN DECELL AND HOW MUCH ENEGY IT GIVES ER GOES UP TO
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,YO ACCOMPLISHE THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE ROUND THE RIT
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU ARE ON MAKER LEK TREMOR THE STROMERS AD MAR BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TONEGATIVE
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THE MORE AM MIND YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENED AT THE STRENGTH IS ITS GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT IS YOUNG ABOUT A METLOGRAPH IS UMNUMBERS
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WILL HAPPEN ON THE OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BADDER E   MY FONDS
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,BUT AMAN HAS TO FILL THROUGH A VASIN WIRE AN ECASING WAY
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,E A WE NOT HEARD OUT DISCOVERY IS THEREOF CISTEN MIV NOW PLUMMING A PRO AT A RIHT BOD THE ELDOM OF MY JINING WITHDRE VERY BREATH
1189,NO,OR IN ENIGT ARIZATA
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT ISN'T TECITY ISN'T FLUING THROUGH BECAUSE AND WE SO TURNED AROUND AN  ANDREWS HAT TO HAV E MOCKET AM IN THE POSITE PLASLET A PAN TOUCHING CHEBEN AND NOT A TURRAT MAKE THE RIFLE LIFE
1191,UM IT WILL IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,AM IT'LL A ONS AS ITTLE THE LIKEULGUN SHOULDBE BRIT AND BRECULATED ARIGE TACK MIKT TA ELIT AN A BURNATA
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS RIGHT,BELIVEREN BECAUSE EM IF WE JUST HAD WHEN IT IN AN ACCUSTODABLE VIMO AND TE SITTING ONTHE PONS A I TE HARLD A HEL THAT AN INSIDE IT STRING TO NITER
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES THUS THE CIRCUIT IS ON WHAT WHEN THE WISE ARE CONNECTED TO THE DESAILD BATTY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CASONWHERE AND THE BASING
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,BOT MIES LETE THE A O QUEN REPITETI IN
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEY'LL BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I OBSERVE IS WHEN YOU A JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TO LIGHT WABS IT'LL LITTLE BE DULL AND A RO SHIBRIH BUT IF YOU HAD TWO BATTERIES IT'LL ONLY TO LIPTLUP SHAN BRIGHTER
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ANDRER THE MATTER THE RUM THAT AM LIHTBAL
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S AN PARTEND BECAUSE AM ELECTRICIICLES THROU
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A SIRCUT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONCE A PATWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING SANTICIATING BOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIPLE
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT IT WILL SHAT LOWER AND LOWER AND NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH THE BATTERY PUT THE
1203,OKAY,GREY
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT,AN LET IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT FOR BE CUT ENER HE MIGHT ITOUT
1205,FINISH,FINISH
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,HALF ANERY PEOPLE OF  NOT WOR
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,WHO YOU MENT OE LONPON  A GRE ON WITH ONE PACTIN HEAD BY A USNT NO HO ER I CAME DOWN AND LOKAN EERA AE JSAPE E BET SIDE  O E I I WONLE OK E DON SUCH ALASH IN HER CASES
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS O HAPPENED IS H WISE NEEY TO BE CONNECTED TO THE GESAL BATTERY AND IT WHAT BUTHOFLIERS HAS TO BE ON A PASION WAR AND ON OCCASIONAL WAR
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,WHEN WE ADMIRABLES THE LIGHT GETS GET WEAKER MECCER
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ALSO ELIIS CREVICASM FOR THE C
1211,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO,BECAUSE SIT'S THATS THE COLORDS USED TO
1212,IT IT TURNS INTO THE,A WOD CHANTINTY AT THE ROOM I
1213,COLORS,COLORS ISEY
1214,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED BU MOST BE RED
1215,UM CHANGING COLOR,UM AN CHANING COLOR
1216,UM IT WILL TURN DARK,AM A LITTLE TENDER
1217,CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS,HE A CHANGED E SONE GODRS ALONG E FILMT
1218,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,AN IT'S NO USE TO THE COLOR CAS IT IS WRENLIME IN ITS COSTPY GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
1219,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,HIT OF THE PRISON IS CRANGENAC COLOR
1220,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,I ULD TUN WELL HAVE HER IN FOR INE CORNER TLAT JUST NOW
1221,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FORTWO PERSON
1222,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,ITS OTEN BECAUSE ISPRT REFLECTING OFTEN TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND ITIFFER BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
1223,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIKE POMBACHING OFF OF OBJECTS TE BOSO COLOR BLUE
1224,SEVEN SIX,THEN SEVEN TOKS
1225,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,WOR I HOWEVEFLEX OFF TO MAKE THESE KINDOF COLORS LIKE A TVIOLETA PURPLE TO BTE GRAIN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TREAD
1226,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,THE I MUST REFLET I AVE RALLY WHILE
1227,THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR,THE REFLECTOR VASUSED HER TO MIXING NECOLA
1228,TURNS INTO,OUN MY ERY CHANGE ON TUBLE ON NAROFA RING
1229,UM STRUCTURE OF A LIGHT,U E ILS OF STACAGER O
1230,A RED,THE RED
1231,UM IT'S REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE OR THE,NO E W AM ATS REFLECTING OFFICE A BLUE I EORATERA PER
1232,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF ALIGHT GREEN HAND ON ORANGE BOOK TI YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT
1233,BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME COLOR,JUS THAT SAME COLOR
1234,TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,TURNE TDO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
1235,YES THE REFLECTION THE COLOR,YES THE REFLECTION MAID THE COLOR
1236,UM THE LIGHT LITTLE REFLECTS OFF THE LIGHT,IT WAS IU ONY ATE YE O TOT OT YOR EM E E O FEMAN SOMTHING OUT OF THERE AND FLAT TOF TOB AN
1237,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OF
1238,SIX COLOR,HE WAS AL
1239,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COLORS REFLECT OFFIN AC HAGES IN COLOR
1240,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SO EOS AND ON MON CIRCUT AND TA E DISA
1241,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,OM WHA HAPPENS TO YOU TANS DARK GRAIN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CARD ITS WHITE IT DOES NOT RETURN SPLUE
1242,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT,THEHAGI
1243,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,ON NAT UM I'LL ONE SPEAS HER TIKNIGHT UH AN I RESSHERS TO BREAK
1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,ANBYIT'S MORSE
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FOREST WAS THE STRONG ENOUGH
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,BUT IT DOESSA MIXET O FIS A WEAKER
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNETISA NEWSPAPER ETOF THE CLIPISUM TOP AND ROSEDER
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MACHANIST WAS YOUR NASSIPAS TO HAVE IN THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNITMONK MANTIKEN
1249,THE MAGNET THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,SOMTHE MACNION I ME THE MACNE IS ONRABLE ON  IS UNDERD THICSTAK AND AN YOUR DISMITIN A MAGAAN PITICACASNA MATESOM CONNECTED TO
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN IT ISETRED WHEN WASH EBER ETS FA BECAS OVE  BECAUSE OFTHE SPEACER
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORSTAN THE SPECIES MADE TO FORCE TE LITTLE BED WEAKER
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WOUT I OBTERVE HAPPENI IS I COUD INTEND PRESSING THE WASHERS GOIN
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT IS VANUBARELY AT ONE SPACER BREAKISTIFUL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM IS NOT RARYS TTISTICON
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,OR WHAT A JUDGEMENT MAKEES TE A MATTER MAKES THE UM A MOUNT TOLLER AND THAT HELPS AT MAKES IT EVEN
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LOFE SIDE IS TO NAIT
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS AND ONE CUP AND  WE PUTMACK MAGNETS AND AOTHER CUPS O SEE IT OM HOW MANY OM WASHERS A BREAK OF THE MAGNETS FALL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE PETISUSE TO MAKE IT TO SOME OF TLY IS HORSTENOUGH
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FIRS FOR SCOLS WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MACNATS NACNET TISM A FORCE OF THE WORSE IS NOT CONNECTED TOH WHIC MAKUSA WEAKER
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,THER SPREADING UPON HER
1260,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M CHANK WHEN I GOT UP E TO HI MAK WASHES IT CAN GO UP TO THE EBROKE CAL
1261,MAGNETISM,MAGNECTISM
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,BUT GOING ON HERE FOM VENY PRESSPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THO MACNICET TOLLAR BUT THE RAGNICS AS THE TATCHING COTHER
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,BECAUSE BIGGER DEINI GOS SMALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES A A MIXED OPRESS KIND OF WEAKER RECURAY CONSIDER BING STRUNKER HAN USUALLY THOUGH FOC
1265,I NEEDED THREE,I NEDED THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,BRI NOTICE IS WEN ITS TO LESS THAN ONE'S TO LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AN THE MAGOMICA HOLLD THE PAPER
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT SEVERING BECAUSE IT'S LONGERAN I HAS MORE FOREST BOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET AND DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METTL AN A MUMMIN THAT KIND OF UM AH THE KIND OF A MAGNET IN EM  THAT'S ALL I HAVE
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE SADESS VIANE WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON TE MAGNET AND STICK INTO A PAPERCLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF IT
1269,THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,NOWS A KINLI
1270,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL BUT THE THIN ONE IS LIKE SO ONE I GUESS LERAN ONLY HAVE ONE PAPERS TO WIT EAS BECAUSE SIT'S THICK INE  NOW WELL A  A NAN I START O MICIMENT GOING LIKE THAT AND A KINDING LIKE MY
1271,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING O TO THICK PECEPEAPER IS THE FOREST AT THE BLOW CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IS SO THICK AND THE THIN NCHEAT BEGINS IT SO
1272,BUT THE DIFFERENT PUSH BACK,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AN MODY PUSHED BACK
1273,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TE MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNEMMICTURE THROUGH AN AGISTIRELLY RELLY NE ARCIT DON AT THIS POICE PLEASE
1274,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,PORMET IS A THAT THAT WIT THAT ASIGN THINGS TO
1275,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WE'VE LEARNED BOU HOW MAGNET'S REACT I'M HAVI KIT THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO OM I SO AL STRONG THAT KICKA THROU ANEOL IN ORDER TO HOLD THE PAPER
1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,BUT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT TE ANY TERM THE MAGNET ON A REACT LI
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISN'T A ACTING LIKE A MAGD A HLIKE WHAT A WIDE CORAPPID AROUND ELECTRICITAN CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH AND STO MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL ON REAXE LIKE A METAL
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,WHEN IT IS TO MAKE  ONIX TICK TO THE PAPY CLUB BET WHEN ITS NOT I CANNOT STICK TO THE PA
1279,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,IN WHAT A O ALONE LOO IS ITE MOCTE ISUALDE TO VICICOPENNANER
1280,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LEARNING ABOUT MAGNEISM
1281,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SORT SNUGGLING THROUGH NAPRGRATER AM PAPER CLIPPOTET
1282,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE JUST SEE THE SAMETHING YOURIS REAMY LAST NIGHT
1283,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,O MOR A SPOSPISURING MEA MONVY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNENT THE AON THE PAPERCLUCK
1284,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,LITTLE SOMPINY IS IT STUCKIN TO AN AIR AND ITCANNAT GOOD TAPER I
1285,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE
1286,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,WEN TO THEREG NATURE OPT HEE ADOTHER TAPE ON AN THE MATET STICK BERE BECAUSE OF TA MAGONET SCONNUCTIN UNHOLDIN
1287,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,BUT IS HAPPENING AS THE FOR SAID CN STILL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNET FORCE IS SO LIKE IT SO STRONG
1288,REPEAT THAT,REPEATED AGAINSLEA
1289,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MARGNANS WERE FROM THE NAIL AND VIS THE NAIL OU LOSES ITS MAGNETIS
1290,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP,THAT'S GOING ON HERAS THE MEAD AND A PIECE OF PAPERCLIP
1291,LEARNNG ABOUT MAGNETISM,INOTPRAY
1292,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER,THE MAGNET AND THE PIPECUR CANNOT REPIED EACH OTHER
1293,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,I SEE IS A MAGNET AND A NAIL AND ITS FIRST KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
1294,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD A PAPERCLEB PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
1295,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT ATRAINES IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETIS
1296,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING ISTE MAGNITISM PRESSES OFF AND BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS MAGINATED
1297,THE FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,TH FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER O MAKE IT MOVE UNDERSTUFF
1298,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET,IT CAN'T BE CAUSE ON THE THE MIGJA JATAM FOI
1299,THE LIGHT BULBS ALL OF THEIR ELECTRICITY AND,LIGHTBULBS ARE ALL O BELL ELECTRICITY AAND
1300,OKAY,PA
1301,A D CELL BATTERIES AND,LADY SHALLBATTER IS
1302,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL AIR HELP LIGHT IT UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY THE
1303,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS NOT OF ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND LET THE LIGHT FALL
1304,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,IN IFFIN WOT CONNECTED THE WISE ORDER THE BASALON IT WHAT IT REALLY WAD BECOMES THI AS TE GIZWOD
1305,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE ARK TAT YOU SHALL BETTERY WIRS AND A LIGHT
1306,BUT I NOTICE IS SOME IMPORTANT THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT,BUT I NOIS VUSION TO CERTEMPITES THER I WISE CANNOT
1307,THE ELECTRICITY FLOW,THE LECGICITY FOR
1308,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,WIC AS THE DIRECTION OF ROW AND IT RITIS RICHISTER DESAL IED IT CHANGES TO THE NEGATIR SIDE AND DEPOSIT OF SLAVIS GOINGS EVRY DIRECTION
1309,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING ADD OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE,OT THERE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SI
1310,WITH THE AT THE SAME WIRE AND YOU,IF I THEMS COSE EIGT BUT BECAUSE IT'S BU A TECHEMIA AN WOTOI
1311,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHEN IT WHATEVER HAVE YOU JUST RIGED YOU IS DIRECTS THE SAME
1312,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHET A WIRE DOESEN A CIRCUITS HELP MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BETTERY
1313,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,ANWHA A ONE RIDE IS HIDDEN THROUGH THE POSSE WIR ON IS GITTING TO THE BASE MYER
1314,WIRES IN IT CIRCUIT CARRY,WHY IS IN AS CIRCUIT CARRY
1315,OKAY BUT,OUQU BY
1316,THE COMPONENT NEED TO BE RIGHT,THE CAPERN PEPOMATICLOW AR
1317,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY IF BATTERY GIVING IT IT'S,ELECTRICITY FLILLS HIGH THE BATTERY GIVING IT ITS ENERGY PISSURE BY T
1318,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,BUT I NOTICE THAT I DIDT AA GID ITH E LIGHT BOLD A RIGHT TO INSORTER TO LIGHT UF THE MIGHT THE BANAGE
1319,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT TO SHED UP ASED ITS GOING THROUGH BULLS UNFEAUTFUL MYERS ENINTO THE LIGHT
1320,WHERE IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE D CELL WIRES,WHERE THE ELECTRICITY ROWS BETE TE TISA IS PE MOTE VIL WIRS
1321,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW THAT IS GOT,BETTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND NOW BETTERIS GO
1322,ELECTRICITY,THE BLOOD OUTTERS AND A
1323,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A CIRCUIT CLYING ROUND AND ROUND THE LAKE IWIT THE ELECTRICITY
1324,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE,I HAVE BEEN LEANING IN VAIN TOM
1325,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITIES FLELLING THROUGH TEPOSITIVE SID  THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1326,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,LAY BOK TO BE RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
1327,WHEN YOU PUT THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING TO,WHEN YE FLIP THEDICON INSTEAD OF BOINT
1328,ON THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH,ALL THE ENERGY IS GOING THR
1329,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATRY HELPS WITH THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BALL TO HAVE LIGHTED ON AND TREALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
1330,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S EPARTANTS OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK CURGLE THROUGH THE FROM BECAUSE IF YOU PUED THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET EP TO GET THE MAT
1331,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,GOCIRCIS IMPORTING BAT CIRCUITIN HOW ITS OM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
1332,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,THEWIRE THE RIVER TO THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT FO THE OM ELECTRICITY AND E ENERGY COOK UP THE
1333,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,W E ATERNED MAGNETIC I BE CARE ON O PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRISH
1334,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,ON THE ELECTRICITY STOES GOES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORSE OF THE FORESIRC HAPPIN CONNECTIVIT WITH ALL THE WACHES CONNECT AND TE THE GILLS TH TEPOSIT OPSIDE THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVES
1335,WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT,WE LEARNT ABOW A YOUR OPOSER GEIN  AM  TO GE FAC PI AN IO WA
1336,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BUGAS IT IRON OR STEEL SHE DE MARITE TO SUBMIT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND N N ONTO IT TO MAKE IT EMIT TO GET THE MAGNETIC WARS
1337,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,ON  THE WATCHERS WON'T STICK TO IT AN TIL THE UP WHERER IS  ON CLOSE
1338,SMALL,AH SIR
1339,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WILE THE CIRCUT OF SPITCH AT LEAST AS SOMETHING HAS TO BE PLUGGED OF A MAN NECK LEK FOR SOLVE ELECTRICIRICAL IS CO THROUSUPTEY THROUGH ANOTHER WILE
1340,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,MASTER HAPPIN AT THE RIVER AND T E WIRE SAY SOM HE ASKED TO AT LEAST CONNECT SOMEWHAROR AT LEAST TO SOMETHING
1341,A RIVET,OOR RATHER
1342,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WELL WHEN IT ALL BE IDETEM A WASHESTOT STICK TO THE THEE THE MEDALTINNAN ON IT CLOSER IT TIX
1343,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWAGE AND THEN SGOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MET BY THE COURSE
1344,SCIENCE,SINT
1345,WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS IN,O WHAT THAT RELATES HISPRCI SER I
1346,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,BENSIT WHEN IT HAS A CLOSER ONON THE MAGNETIC FORCES ABLE TO A WHAT CONECT GET THE WASHERS SAY AND THE WASHERS WELL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT OPENED IT OPEN
1347,THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,THAT IS ALL AU BOUP T IS SOMAR A MAGNAGNETIC FORCE
1348,IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE,AH IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
1349,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT,A CLEREPUTER
1350,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,BAT THAS BEEN ITS AN OPEN CIRCU THE MAGNETIC FORCE SEM CONNECT WITH THE WATHERS BECAUSEITIT HAS NOACOMPEL IT TO THE WIRE
1351,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF THE WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S SWITCHED IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS AFTTER THING WHEN IT'S PUSHE OUTWARD ON LETTHING STICK SOP WHEN IT'S FIXED IN IT STICKS SOMETHING
1352,REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,IT BE THAT AGAINT
1353,IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S LIKE A SAND,IT ALL THO SICIT SAND
1354,UM THE ROLE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SO,INANARROLE OF ANELECTURAL MAGNETIS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SAVIR
1355,AH,
1356,WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SO THE ENERGY IT GOES,I HAD BEEN TO EAS TO SO THE HE ENERGY ICAUSE
1357,UM WHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THE GUY HE'S LOOKING AT HIS REFLECTION AND YOU CAN STILL SEE IN THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF HOW THE MIRROR REFLECTS,E ANORNIN UM  WHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THA GEY HEIS A GISPLECTIONS AND YOU STILL SEE NOW ON THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF ON AR HOW REFLEX
1358,UH THE,AH THE REFLESH
1359,SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL,WAS THE SHES REFLECTIN IN THA SOMLIKE TON EEURN NOBOVY MAMERA AN IT SHELS  ON THE WALK
1360,THE LIGHT IT ON THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE,SOME WI ITIN TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE LIGHT REFLEX OFF THE CAT
1361,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION,HEM BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OF THE MIRROR WHICH GIVES HIM SO EMA TOSEIE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
1362,IT'LL EVENTUALLY HIT THE STAR RIGHT HERE,A GARREL A ATURY HEAD BIRNS STAR EGUR R
1363,NO,FER NEMANNIG
1364,SOMETIMES IT HURT,N SOMETIMES GET HER E E
1365,IT BOUNCES OFF IT REFLECTS TO ANOTHER THING,IT BOUNTES OFF AHEN REFLECTS THROUG ANOTHER THINK
1366,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT UM REFLECTIONS THERE ARE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE IT SHINE BRIGHTER,BY HOW THEY GIVEN THEM REFLECTIONS AT OUR GROW THE WORTHER ABLE TO SEE TE SHAN PRATER
1367,AND IT IS,BR II ESS
1368,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND IT'S SETTING TO THE STAR,OWHAT IS HAPPENING IS THOUGH AND THE LIGH IS REFLECTING OF DIFFERENT MERISAN AT SETTING TO HE STAR IS NSAN SNAP M
1369,THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT BULB,THE LIGHT AT THE LABOV ARM CONTRATED TO HER HUMAN EYE
1370,REFLECTION,REFLECTION
1371,REFLECTION,REFLECTIONOF
1372,THE GUY HE FLICK THE SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHT,THE GIHY FLICTERS WHICH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
1373,LIKE A MIRROR CAUSE SOMETIMES REFLECT IT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,LIKE O MA A SOMETIME REFLECT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOM LIKE TA
1374,WHAT I KNOW IS UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULB LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IT ONE,WHAT I KNOW THESE THE UNCERTAIN LIBULBS LIE BRED AIR AND AND FOCUS HAD ONCE BOUGHT
1375,THEY BOUNCE OFF IT REFLECT TO OTHER STUFF,AN THEY BAN OF AN REFLECT AT A TO OTHER THAFT
1376,REPEAT THAT AGAIN,OF RUPIDAKIN
1377,THE PENCIL IS IN A CUP OF WATER,A BONT OF HIS YONA CUPON WATER
1378,WHETHER REFLECTIVE HOW IT REACTS,BY THE REFLECTIVE HOW IT REACTED
1379,REFLECTION,REFLECTONN
1380,IF ITS AND IN CONNECTS IF THIS HE DOES IN AND THEN A DOES EITHER,IF ITS AN AN ASSAR CONNECTS IF ITS ESTINES IT DOESN'T IN IF IT EMENON IT DOES IT EITHER
1381,WHAT'S GOING ON IS FIRST OF THE MAGNET JUST THE ONE IS LET TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE ITS START SAME IN ABSENT,OIT GOING ON IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET OSM WON I LET TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE ITS NETICE IT'S THE ASAME QUADRON ANOTHER OPS
1382,REFLECTIONS BY IF WE PUT MAGNET UNDER IT THEN,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I THOG SHE'S TRYING TO FIND HER WAY AGAINST THE NORTH OR SOUTH
1383,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IS SECOND PART OF IT,I THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE S CERTAIN PART OF
1384,THE FORCE AND MAGNETISM IS NOT GOOD STICK TOGETHER,BUT THE FORCE OF THE MEGNETISM IS NOT GONLETIT STICK TOGETHER
1385,I THINK WHAT IS ALL ABOUT IS SHE TRYING THE FINAL WAY I GUESS NORTH OR SOUTH,A THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUADRONS IN THE EARTH
1386,WHAT IS SIMILAR IS THIS SIDES TO CONNECT,WHAT A SIMILAR IS A THE SIDES TO CONNECT
1387,I SEE TO MAG,I SPEEK TO MY
1388,GREAT,GRAY
1389,WOW ATTRACT AND NEST ATTRACT AND IN AND,WELL ASANAN ATTRACK AND ANES A TRACK AND A MAN AN ATENANO
1390,SORRY ABOVE MAGNETISMS,ARE INFENY ABOUT MAGNETISMS
1391,NOT,AFFECTIONS BY IF YOU PUT A MAGNET UNDER IT THEN YOU SPINN IT IT A PINTY THING WORKEEP SPINNING AN SPINNING
1392,I THINK IT WOULD NOT CONNECT BECAUSE THE SAME QUADRANT,I THINK YOUR WU NUT CONNECT BECAUSE IF THE SAME QUADRON
1393,THE CONNECTED SERIES BECAUSE A,NO CONNECTED O SERI SIR I N I NOT CAUS O
1394,THANK YOU I HAVE LOTS FINE,THANK YOU I HAD LOTS
1395,WHAT HAPPENED THE ELECTRICITY JUST,LET HAVE EVIN A GREAT FENDER AN TESONS NOAST FOR MURDERN OTOSAPLY ORIN
1396,WHAT HAVE GIVING IN THE WEEKS,AR AN APICULAE
1397,BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY FINE WHICH IS REPEAT THAT THAT REPEAT,FIRST WE LET TILE DIN AN TINUA TEES REHAUGATIC EMPERN IN E RE
1398,WHAT YOU THING MORE THAN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB WENT OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECT,ONEY OR I NOT A ANQUITHEAD WITH IS CONTINU A HUNEMATTER  FOLLIN THE MIDDLE  BA INDE IE LAPE BRINKED OUT AND THER WAST TILTI NEC TE RECOGNIZIN A HEA THROW THE ETE
1399,BEESLY WIRE THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDLE THING,IT WAS NOW LAD UP BBECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MEDDL THING
1400,THIS PICTURE ARE,HIS PICTURES O
1401,IT'S GOING WOW A IS THE FILAMENT THE AND OUT,TOI REY A THE HEAD OF THE MEMORY THROT A LAWYER IN WRENT OUT
1402,LAST YEARLY MEANS THAT ELECTRICITY WHAT GO OTHER ONE IS ELECTRICITY THAT EASY,LAST IONNE E MEAN IN SAD TO MAKE A LECTITU TO MY THROUGOUT ATER MY OSPE ONHIN IN FIL AN O OFF IF TOTIN ME THAT NEW
1403,IS THERE IS NO LIGHT,WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE IS NO LIGHT
1404,THINK IT'S,THINK IT
1405,THE WIRE THE ELECTRICITY THOSE THAT'S GOING IS BECAUSE AN LIGHT BULB OF OUT,THE REASON WHY THE LEXUSY AVE CLOSE TOP SCOING IT'S  BECAUSE YO ANTETER I BOBURNT OUT
1406,WHAT I THINK MORE HAPPENS IS ELECTRICITY GOES STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND LIGHT BULB IS STOP STOP LIGHTING UP,WHUT I THINK BOHARGAN AME IT THE ARECTACITYWL BO STOP LYING THRI AND  LIKE BULPESELL STOP LIGHTING UP
1407,HAPPENS IS AND THE FILM WAS GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND WHAT IS ACTION,RABIN W THE WENT REPEATY AND THE FIRAMENT WILL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN INTO THE INTEREST
1408,IT MAY BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE A CONNECT INTO LINE THE,IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BAS THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE EVENINGS ITALITE UP IN ONLYRY DO THAT
1409,WHAT THAT MIGHT BE AND WOULD THAT CONFUSE,NOT ENOUGH TO TON ORWA MAD MI IA IANGER YOU YELLOW NO I DO NOT WITHET AT INTRIN
1410,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT IS SERIOUS OKAY WORKS WIRES SO AND GO GOING WHAT'S HAVE ONE WIRE AND IN THE,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS TOOK AT OR TIS BIESS A AND GO O SOOVER STAP OW AN R W YOU HAVE ONE WIRING AN THE OGERAT CONMIDDENT MEMN
1411,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THAT IS NO LIKE I MEAN,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS THIS BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN ELECTYTE TR
1412,HE REASON LIKE THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEM FINAL RECHARGE IN THE WIRE LIKE ITS,THE REASON WHY COT THAT IS BARNEY ITS BECAUSE LEM IS FINALLY TURCING THE WIRELECT AND SUPPOSE
1413,WHAT I THINK IT GOING ON HERE SINCE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT THE THINGS IS NOT ELSE AND THE NOTICED TO BECAUSE THE FILAMENT IT WILL BE ORDER GO TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB GIVEN ENERGY,BUT I THINK IT'S GOING ON HERE SINCE TOO LIHTBULBS I'M NOT THEIN IS RABBERY AUT IN NODE S PLANTIN ARITL TI A LIGHT UP BECAUSE A FILLIMENT WHO IT WILL BE ON INORDEN'T TO GO THROUGH THE LETTER LIKE UL FIC ETEN ENEGE
1414,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THERE REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH DIFFERENT NEW ONE,FOR THIS BEING SHOWN HE HAS TE REPLACE AD BETTERY WITH HE DIFFERENT NEW ONE
1415,I WILL CHECKS BY LIGHT BULBS I GUESS TWO OR ONE LIGHT BULB AND MORE LIGHTUP WORK,THE WULTEST UC A PECUNIAR TIN IS DEFIED LY OVSN AND I GUESS TO WERE WAN MY HELD AND ASMAMUMULINA BOAR AT OI VALIN
1416,WHAT WE NOT DIFFERENCED BUT LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY HE WAS SWITCH SIDE,WWHAT LEA AT TE TIN O I NA ROLING AND YOU DIIN TO SAY IT NOTO A FOTO BACK ERY OF EMO CHILD IN WHAT I  TE IGT WASLY ENOUGH OF YOU AND NOW OAL HELP ME WAS WHICH HE SAID
1417,WHAT HAPPENING THIS ENERGY IS JUST WASTING ON INTO THE AIR BECAUSE THOSE NOW ELECTRICITY INTO,WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ENERGY LUSES WASTING ALIN TER BECAUSE TOLS NUMBERGE AN ELECTRICITY ANTO AR
1418,CIRCUIT LIGHT IS THE SERIES AND IT ADD SUCH ONE WIRE CONNECTED,PISER PITON A SICEDEL LI IN THE SEORIES SHOULD TIT THE AT LEAS HAVE TO BE ONE WIRE CONNECTED
1419,NOT SO GREAT,NOT SO GREAT
1420,WHAT HAPPEN EVEN THE BULB BRING IT MEAN LIGHT BULB,OR WHAT HAPPENING IT WHEN THE BOOT AN DOWI IT WON'T LIGHT ANUR ON THE STE CASE ANOTHER A NO BATTER AN MEAN MON LIGT
1421,BUT I WAS THOSE DIFFICULT A LIKE THE ENERGY,BUT I KNOW BOUT A  AN  A TYPICAR WHO HARTS DID NOT I LIKE BAT AND NEXT SORK
1422,WHAT INTO THE ELECTRICITY WENT TO THE ONE OF THE CIRCUIT WENT TO THE ITS STOPPED WORKING,WHAT INPTATA A HIS ANYTHING ITHOUT ONE OTHER SIRCIN HIS HAND RUE BANO LAUG HUM IT TAB WORKIN
1423,HAVE BEEN WHEN I NOTICE ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB WILL WORK AND OTHER ONE HAS IS,ETEN ADONRN OTI FOR LOOKERYBO IF ONE OF THE WRITER NAME ROUNDED BY THE LANAA A AN PAL HIM
1424,BUT I NOTICE ONE LIGHT BULB THIS LIGHTING UP THIS IT IS RIGHT,WUT I NOWT A TUMBLE AN ONE MIGHT WELP IS WRITING UP IN THE THIR AND CHILDRN TOWR AND  NOT RECKON AT ALL
1425,THERE ARE CONNECTING CLOSE ONE AND ONE WIRE CONNECTED TO,AND THERE CONNECTEDLIN A PARA OR OF PINCILS AN WORRI AN MOR ED DINER ON HE KNOW NOT TOO
1426,IT MIGHT HAVE THE SAME THING HAS BLACK ROCK DOES,AND MIGHT HAVE THE SAMETING AS THE BLACKROCK DOES
1427,IT CONNECTED AND ITS DID,A CONNECTORS ON E STATE
1428,IT HAS JUST IT KIND OF METAL IN IT,IT HAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MEDDLE IN IT
1429,WE TALKED AT AND THINGS THAT STICK TILL ON MAGNET SPILLING ABOUT IRION TELL ME ABOUT IRON AND WHY JUST THIS STICK TO REFRIGERATOR AND HOW MAGNETS ARE USED,WI TALKD ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS THAT STICK TO AM MAGNETS WE LEARNT ABOUT IRON TELLING ME ABOUT IRON AND UM WHY DOES IT STICK TO A FIDRIOR AN HOW MAGNETS ARE USED
1430,HAD GET BACK TO STICK IT WILL STEEL,IF I TRY TO GET THAT TISTIC IWLL STAY ON
1431,BECAUSE IT HAS A SAME METAL IN IT,BECAUSE IT HAS A CERTAIN MADLE IN IT
1432,ONE IS STEEL WHAT THE OTHER IS IRON I GUESS,WHEN A STALE AND WANT THE THE ONE IS IRON I GUESS
1433,A BRASH BRING,A BRASS RING
1434,THE BLACK ROCK EITHER GREEN ROCK BECAUSE GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT WILL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE HAS THE SAME THING NOT IN THE OCEAN THAT STICK TO MAGNET,THE BLACK ROCK REATHER GREEN ROK BECAUSE THE GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT OLL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE HAS A SETAINTHING NAT IN THE OCEAN TATS BLACK THAT STICKS TO MACK
1435,RIGHT,PRAY
1436,MAGNET ONLY TAKE TO METAL,MAGNETONIS TAKE TWO MEDDL
1437,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET I
1438,MAGNETS IS MAGNETISMS,NAVIN NET TOS MACHNETISMS
1439,IS ARE MAGNETISM,TES IMMAGNETISN
1440,REPEAT THAT AGAIN,REPEATED AGAIN
1441,MAGNETS CHECK TO METAL,MACNIC SICT AM   NETTL
1442,AND NOTE FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NOT DISSOLVE,AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO AN BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
1443,IT ISSTICKING BECAUSE IT IS SAME KIND OF METAL,TAT IS TIKIN BECAUSEOF IT CERTAIN KINDY OF META
1444,WHAT'S HAPPING HERE IS A MAGNETS STICKING TO A NAIL,WHAT HAPPENING HERE IS I MACNEC STICKING TO HER AND NEL
1445,THINGS THAT STICK MAGNET OR EITHER METAL AND ONCE USUALLY PACKED PLASTIC,THE THINGS SAT SICK TO MAGNET ARE ETHER MAAM MEDAL AND THE ONES ARE EASULY PRACTIC PLASTER GERWIT
1446,BECAUSE THEY DID PROJECT,BECAUSE THEY DID A PROJEC
1447,THAT IS CALLED MAGNETISM,THAT IS CALLED MAGNETISM
1448,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE IS,BUTLEDOMY
1449,PAPER CLIP AND YES THAT IS,PAPER CLAB TR HAND IS TAT
1450,YES,AGA
1451,THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK,THE PA PEROFESSONER STAYS ON AND THE STEEL MAL AND THE BLACK ROC
1452,I THINK IT'S ALUMINUM,I THINK ITS  ALUMINAM
1453,WELL IT BECAUSE ITS STILL LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE IS NOT ELECTRICITY TO GO RUN THROUGH EACH,WIUD BECAUSE ITS TWO LIBUBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE'S NOT ANOP ELECTRICITY TO O RUN THROUGH EACH
1454,IT GOES THROUGH HOW THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONE GOES BACK INTO IT,FROM IT GOES THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE LIND GOES BACK INTO IT
1455,THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS THE ELECTRICITY ITS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTT LIPLOBS
1456,WHAT THE HAVE THEY COMPARED IS SETUP DIFFERENTLY STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY,I WONDER HOW THEY COMPARE IS YUST SET UP DIFFERENT WAYS BUT STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY
1457,GREAT,GREAT
1458,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,A KIDDY REPEAT THAT AGAIN FOR YOU
1459,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP,WHAT'S GOING ON IS A THE BATTERIES IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIPOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP
1460,I THINK I GUESS THE WHY I AM THE MADE CHOICES,I THINK I GUESS THE BUTTEMEN DAM AD CHOICES BUT
1461,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND FOR HAPPENS IS RUNNING CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT HELP TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,BECAUSE WE DARE AN EXPERMENT HONOR AND FOR HARPING IN SPELLIN CONNECIOTS WI BATTERY A HELP ME O THAN I NO MIT MI N CHAN
1462,WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT BULBS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH HIM AND RELATED IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE LIKE,WHAT I OBSERVE ABOUT THE BALBS ANDS THEIR ENERGIIS GOING THROUGH HIM AND I REALLY TO IT IN IT GOES BACK INTO THE BETTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO THE LIGHT
1463,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WHILE IN A SERIOUS AGAY A HATIGEN IT MANY ERECTICITY  STAP GOS HAP GO BUT IN A PARILOUS WII BLOS ROUND AND NECON RAD AND BAC TO
1464,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOR AND IN A SERIOUS CIRCUIT WHILE THERE IS ONLY ISPOSIBLY ONE
1465,WHAT'S GOING ON IT GONE OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH BUT STILL USING THE SAME THING BUT NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND BY THE,WHAT'S GOING ON IT IS GOING AT THE BETTER AND THROUGH YEBUT STILL USIN THE SAY OTHING BUT THEY MADE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND ODER GELITA
1466,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,CAN I REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE
1467,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,REEN NOTICE BOUT THE PATRANG IL BE ENERGY  FOR DIFON
1468,WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WOULD BE MUCH BEST ONE NOW HE GUESS IS THOUGH ONE WITH A BETTER AND ONE MIGHT BOL BECAUSE THERE IS NOT WASTE AN ENERGY
1469,THE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THE CONNECTED RIGHT,S A UM IN THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP I  THE WAY T SCOIN COCONNECTED WRITIN
1470,WHAT I OBSERVE THE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I OBSERVE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THE ENERGY'S GOING THROUGH THE BETTER AND GOING TO BOTH THE LIGHT DOPS
1471,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,TOWN ELL I NOTICE ASN'T ANY HER WIT BOILING YO UNDE BATTERY IT'S GOING INTO THE BATTER
1472,THE THE BATTERY REALLY ELECTRICITY,THE END OF THE BETTYR RAY ELECTRICITY
1473,WHAT I THINK WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIPULBS UM IS ITALITE BRITER AND BRITER
1474,I THINK THIS IS THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUI
1475,IF THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS,THE KINDS OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ITS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERY CIRCUITS
1476,THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,UMTHE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIKE BULPS A THEY LIGHT UP IT BRNKS OUT AND YET TO REPLEX WITH ANOTHER ONE
1477,IT IS FLOWING INTO THE POSSTIVE SIDE,IT IS ROARING INTO DEPOSITOR
1478,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T NOT LIGHTING WERE AND WHAT NOW ITS LIGHTING SO BRIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE,WHAT I NOTICE HAT THE LIPUB IS IN NO LIGHTING RULE WENT WHELE NOW ITS LIGHTNING S SO BRIGHT BECAUSE THERES TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED THE OPPOSITE SIDE
1479,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB WHEN BACK OUT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB BACK UP,THAT'S GYING ON WITH THAT LITTLE CHESTITY IT'S GOING THROUG IS ALIGTFLE AN BACK OUT THROUGH LIGHTOUR HEAND WALKOT
1480,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK ITS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ON CONNECTIONS TO IT IN PARALLES IT ATAPHMOL
1481,THAT ONE REMEMBER DIRECTION,WHAT I EMEN VERY THOUGT HE ASKED O BE  COING OUND A DIRECTION
1482,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,BEEN LEARNING AN SINS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERY CIRCUIT
1483,I THINK THE CIRCUIT ONE TOP BECAUSE THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND AN XC BUT LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY BRIGHT,I SHINK THE SECOND LINE TOP BECAUSE HOUSE THERE'S A LIBOBBA AN EX SEEBLE THE LIPROTER SHINE ON REALLY BRIGT
1484,OH WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES THE MORE ENERGY SOME MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU CAN LIGHT UP THERE IS ENOUGH NOT YOU ELECTRICITY FOR,WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BETTER TO ONE LITPULP IT GIVES AT MY ENERGY THE MORE LIPL YO LIGHT UP THEREIS NOT ENOUGH JUICE OR INDER ELECTRICITY FOR IT
1485,UM MAGNETISM,AMU MAGNETISM
1486,UM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THEY WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE THEY HAD POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WOULD REPEL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD UM GO TOGETHER YES,AM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THERE WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE THA POSITIVE A NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WERE TO REPEL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD UMGO TOGETHER YES
1487,YES WE DID,Y WI
1488,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEY'LL REPEL IF IT THEY'RE LIKE NORTH AND NORTH THEY REPEL AND IF THEY'RE SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEY'LL REPEL IFTHEY'RE LIKES I NORTH AND NORTH THEY'LL REPEL AND IS THEYRE SOIN SOTING COMMENTES REPEL

1897,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN RIDE IT DOWN
1898,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO AT THE TOP OF THE POD AND THEN ARE GONNA GO DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF GOING DOWN LIKE UM MAYBE LIKE IN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING IS AT,YA M SOME PEOPLEAR N LIKE FOR SLOPE OM SOME PEOPLER DONT GO AT TH TOP OF THE PAN AND EN MARGRA TO GO DOWN STEP AND THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND A JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT A IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IN HAVEA A VERY WELL CHANCE OF COME DOWN LIKE A MAY BE LIKE AN ABOUT FIVE LIK TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE TE STREAM IS THAT

1900,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE A TWENTY MAYBE LIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP,WERE EXPECTING IT TOO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE AN TWENTY MAYBE UNLIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT WILL HELP
1901,BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP,BUT I YUASK YOU LIKE WHERE IT SET UP
1902,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,WHALL OH THARS JUST AT A KIND OF HOUSE SHE TOLD HIS PRIS A
1903,YEAH,
1904,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,WELL UM BECAUSE UH WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALF WAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINSE DOES A PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY
1905,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,WOO SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALF WAY AND ALL THE WAY AND DUM SOMETIMES WHEN WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLAINGOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE ARM CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN LIKE CAT
1906,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,YA LIKE I WON'T IT IT I PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER WHEN MA A OBLET LIKE UM TO WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR I PLANED ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO WINES AND THE SHIN WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO SPEND WAR
1907,SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE,SORRY SAANSB DISTRACTING I I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE
1908,YEAH,
1909,WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY THOUGH,WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT TODAY
1910,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TOO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN A I MAY HAVE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT ONE ISAT THE WHOLE UR AD
1911,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,UH WELL A WE ARE CHOOSING ONE VERIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND DUMB OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO A MISSMOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MANY FANS AND WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER
1912,A SANDWICH,SANDWICH
1913,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WELL LIKE MY YUM THE MT GREW BRIGHT IN FRONT AN WE THEY DID AM THREE MAT THEY DID ONE SENDIY MEANER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THA WHAT YOU MEAN WERE COMPARING THE
1914,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO A ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND INE DID FIVE INCH AND OF THE CUP UH AND FIVE INCHES AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS A WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS A A YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE IT WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SIXCESFUL
1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OUR JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO TO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER RD AND THES WE STARTED PUTTING IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE SEN O METERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AND THE FOR FIVE INCHES OF THE SENTIMETERS AND UM
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,THEY WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TIE TAN YOU DO YOU KNOW ON THE TI TANIC THAT THEI LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD A MORE PASSENGERS MAY BE THAN A REGULAR CRUIS BOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REAL A BIG CRUW SHIP
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNY IS JUST TOOF ASLEY WE PUC WE TRY TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN LET GO TO THE SIDE
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,FEEL LIKE A SUPER STAR LE ALREADY KNEW THAT KNOWIN CANE
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASHED PENNIES AND SO U WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
1922,YEAH,ER
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,AM WOR AR CHIMINIS I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WERE KIND OF A QUESTING AM HOW HE FIGURED OUT AM LIKE COWBOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WE WITH THE MASS WITH THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HAWVOT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,UH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT AND OUR BIN ITS LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UH AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS AND THREE THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,FOK AWELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT WAS WE TOOK THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT I AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STEADY TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND ICE A THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL AT O ONE SIDE IT WAS GOING TO SINK EVEN FASTER SO
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLIT
1927,THE HEIGHT,THE HIGHT
1928,MAYBE,MAYBE
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,WELL IT'S PASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LEFT BOAT CAN HOLD
1930,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE
1931,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,WELL WE WE JUST PLACE THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS
1932,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CREWS BOAT M LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE IS A TA IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT A GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT U THE PEOPLE  COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A GAGILIANT TIMES BIGGER SO
1933,YEAH,H
1934,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YO HAE E THREE THE FOR THE THREE  WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WAY TO PUT IT UP HIERRE BUT WHELN WE HAD THE SQORDER GUN THORRY OH WHEN WE HAD THE SQORDER GUN WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO AS LIKE DOWN HERE DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREES DOWN HERE DOWN HERE AND SO WE STUCKED IT OLLP WHEN WE PUT IT IN A TEST TO
1935,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREE CENTIMETERS,THE MILLA LEADERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN HER CUP THREE SENIMEANERS
1936,FIFTY S A HUNDRED AND THREE AND FIFTY SIX,FIFTY SI D LITHEE AND FIFTY SEX
1937,AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY,AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY
1938,THAT LIKE THE,THAT LIKE THE
1939,ONE MORE TIME,ARO
1940,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,A GOOD WE GOT MORE THEN THE ONE'S LEDGE STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SANK TO THE SIDE AND
1941,IS THIS THING ON RIGHT,IT IS THEONE
1942,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCEIS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANT TO PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT IS BIG SARTA
1943,FIVE INCHES,FIVE INCHES NE
1944,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN WHA
1945,I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER,I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER
1946,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT,WEL  EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO  EVERYBODY JUST IT THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YA SOME PEOPLE GOT
1947,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT IS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I GUESS NIGHT WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES
1948,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MMM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBE TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK,WO THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLE LEADERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN  LIKE TEST TOB TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLA LEADERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLA LEADERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK
1949,W WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THAT MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE,WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THEMY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KIND I DID LIKE MAY BE A MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TAILT A LITTLE
1950,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UH ONE TO FIVE INCHES THAT YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND,A OL IN CLASSPIAV LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATERCRUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING A ONE TO FIVE INCHES YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP A MIN AND ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MATTER F PASSENGERS AND
1951,WE THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TWO Y WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND,WHIC THIS IS KIND OF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TOO WHEN THEYRE HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THER A WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND

2006,CAN I HEAR MY,DID I HEAR WHY
2007,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMENERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
2008,YEAH,E
2009,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,OH WE HAD TO DO AN SORRY A WE HAD TO WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT SDAGES I GUESS IN OUR FIRST ONE BE HAD TO DO FOUR OR FLETS O AN SIX CENTIMENERS VERY CLOSE TO THE SKIND OF SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THAT WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND T EN WE DID TWO ANAN
2010,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,UM WE TUCK CA FLUPFER UM LIKE UM I LIKE AN OLD EN DAISY NOHOWT STUFFD FLINGS LIKE A CANNONPOL FER LIKE BOARS AND WHAT NOT AND DUM WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WAIT UM OF THIS OBJECT WERE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEYARE DOING RIGHT THERE
2011,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,THE YALL AH LIKE WE KIND INTO TWO VERYBLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WORSING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL
2012,CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET YOUR RESULT,JUS THAT'S ONLY WAKING IT YOUR RISILE
2013,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WE YES WE WILL A MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO TEND CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED AT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY SEVEN METERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY AND MIGHT U HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS GO AS HIGH AND THE VARYABLE WERE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE TICK GOES IN OR OUT
2014,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE EM AR PSICK IS THE POPSCLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SOADS LIKE ONE TO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
2015,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE GOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN T THIRTEEN ONE TO THIRTY FOUR OR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE
2016,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,UM LIKE HAT IT WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND GOES UP TO SIX SENNIN WEANERS A POPSYCAL STICK AND WEARE PUTTING AN IN AS FAR AS WEWOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ADUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM BCAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BAL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY SPUNNING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW I READY SAYD HOW HIGH IT GOES SO UM UH
2017,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,A THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLPPER AND DAM AM SOMETIMES THE BALL WHEN ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING A KIND O TAKE MEASURING TAPE
2018,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND THEM SOW WE AM OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR ITOUT IT IS NOT NOWING BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN ET SET THE MORE FAR IS HOW
2019,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALTOGETHER SO UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN IT WA
2020,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULT SO THAT'S HOW MUCH HE DECIDED HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE CHIEL TO SEESE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR RESULT SO RECURNIT MIXING MATH INTO THIS
2021,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUMBALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE I'M I GUESS NIVET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURTA BID BY THIS I FEEW
2022,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,UMBLE MY GROUP AND I TOOK A SMALL ALLUMINUMFOI BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT ALUM BOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSYCLE STICK AS IF WE DID WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UAFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USED OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSTYCLE STICK
2023,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOR EACH INCH SELECT FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID AT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS
2024,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,SO LET SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLUCKED IT IN THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT ENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEYOULD GO CLOSE TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE
2025,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,AH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE U LUMINUFL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE IS A MEASURE IN CAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT AR LIKE GUESS SO WAS
2026,BY FOUR,BY FOUR

2420,WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF,PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIHT BOLPS AND STUFF
2421,OK BYE,CARVE BY
2422,I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF,I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF AN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
2423,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON UNTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON TILL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE
2424,I THINK IT COULD BE BOTH ACTUALLY,I THINK IT COULD BE BOLT ACTUALLY
2425,THIS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO,ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
2426,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BY TO OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT,THCIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHE ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS AR UMCLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEI SHAPES DIFFERENT
2427,YES,YES
2428,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIKT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S HE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
2429,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL ST,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE THE PARALLELS THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT ELL ALL THE OTHER ONES TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONES THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONES STILL ST

2437,MABE I'M NOT REALLY SURE,MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
2438,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YES SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WEARE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT TO LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON
2439,THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON,THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT IN THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OFF A LIGHT BULB WHEN THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON

2476,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED SING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE DEW SELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT
2477,INTO THE LIGHT BULB,INTO DELIGHTFUL
2478,E PLACE WHERE,E PLACE WHERE
2479,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WE WERE USING WHIRE AUNT A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UMWHITE BULP
2480,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE WHITE BULL TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICLY TRISTA FLOWS THAN IT GOES TO THE MINOS SIDE BUILTS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRIITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE IN EITHER THE LHIGHT BULP AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT
2481,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
2482,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,TRAVELS FROM THE PLACIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINASIDE AND GET TORED INTO THE MINOCID MINOCIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT
2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT IN YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAND ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURE
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AN TEXTURE AND
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS IN VERY IMPORTANT ROLL BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOTH AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,EM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT A THE SALT LAKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS OF ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THIS SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILE WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,IT IS COLD WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,NO WEH AH GOD
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS ITIMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY ARE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUED PILE INSTEAD OF N ONE ALTOGETHER IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S A SOLUTI
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT ON ITS PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN IN ITS DAZ AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT IN YET
2494,SALT,THOUGHT
2495,THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THIS MIXTURE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS,THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THIS MIXTURE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS
2496,SOLUTIONS,SOLUTIONS
2497,UH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK,A THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SQUIRREL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK
2498,THEY'RE SEPARATING,THEYARE SEPARATING
2499,THE SALT WILL WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,THE SALT WOULD WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2500,GOOD BYE,GOOD BYE
2501,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE PROPERTIES OF SAUL IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES A IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT I WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER
2502,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS ONE ONE OR MORE THESE WUNMULTPUL THINGS ARE MIX TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPUL THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
2503,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,THE SALAD HAS MANY THINGS MIXED INTO IT ON ONE OF THE CUTS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEAMS AND NORMAL BEAMS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES
2504,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU AM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER IN STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN AM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL SAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN
2505,THEY FLOAT,THEY FLOW
2506,THEY ARE ALL MIXTURES,THEY ARE ALL MIXTURES
2507,WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
2508,THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP,THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUFF AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP
2509,IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE,IS CALLED A MIXTURE
2510,I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE,I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE PUT SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR MIXTURE
2511,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ON THE TRAIL MAKE SEPARATE AND TATSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2512,EVAPORATION,DEVAPORATION
2513,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF ILLUSION THAT EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT SINCITEED
2514,THEY'RE MORE DILUTED,THEY ARE MORE DILUDED
2515,SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER,SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER
2516,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLAR HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
2517,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY FULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE FANTASTIC,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY PULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE TASTIC
2518,UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM,AH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM
2519,WELL TODAY WE USED UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CAN'T,WELL TO DAY WE USED A WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE AGAN
2520,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UM PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS AM ORIN PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AN THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE
2521,THE SOLVENT,THE SOLVANT
2522,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE
2523,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LESS IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILL METERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS A DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LAST IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MAC
2524,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNI FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAN ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WON'T,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNIE FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU COULD ALSO TELL IT BY WAIT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WOULD D
2525,WEIGHT TASTE AND COLOR,WEIGHT TASTE AND COLOR
2526,ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS,ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS
2527,WE CAN ADD MORE WATER,WE CAN ADD MORE WATER
2528,A MIXTURE,A MIXTURE
2529,BYE MARNI IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO LATER,BY MARNEY IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO LATER
2530,I'M GOOD,I'M DEAD
2531,I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE STUFF,I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE STUF
2532,IT WOULD TASTE LESS FLAVORFUL AND GRAPE,IT WOULD TASTE LESS FLAVORFULFALL AND GRAFY
2533,IT IS MORE DILUTED,IT IS MORE DILUTED
2534,I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRIEND ON CRUTCHES,I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRIEND I PREND DOES NOT CRRUT
2535,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILL LEADERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUBE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE
2536,ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM,ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION AN
2537,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A THINGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD UM YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE,YOU CAL DO MANY THINGS YOU CULDN POUR THEM INTO A LITTLE THANGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD A UCOULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE EM HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCOTCHED LOT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE
2538,ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS,ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS
2539,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT LA WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GREAT MIX ONE THAT HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LAST PURPLE
2540,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY ONES YOU CAN'T SEE,WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY IF ROM FUIT CANT
2541,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SORRY WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S A HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR
2542,YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENE
2543,UH ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,A ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE
2544,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SKALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
2545,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIED MILE LATERS OF THE WATER BUT WITH THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE
2546,YOU COULD TELL HOW CONCENTRATED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER,YOU CAN TELL HOW COMPTE TRAINDED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINKS MIX THE ONE THAT HAS THE LAST POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER
2547,BYE MARNI IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE BYE,BY MARNIE IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO BABA
2548,YES,YES
2549,I DON'T KNOW,OLD O I DON'T KNOW
2550,BY DOING GRAM ADDING,WY DO ELY GRAND ADDING
2551,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT NOT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SALUBE WITH A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
2552,I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED,I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRTED
2553,ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE,ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE
2554,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS,I THINK THE ONE WITH CHANNY GRAMPS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HUAS MORE SOLUE THE OTHER ONE HAS LAUED
2555,TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS AGAIN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS THAT'S WHAT THIS PICTURE SHOWS I'M DONE,TEN GRAAMS PUF TWENTY GRAMS PLUFF TWENTY GRAMS AGAIN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS THAT'S WHAT THIS PICTURE SHOWS MDAN
2556,THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT,THINKS FORNIE I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BET
2557,A MIXTURE,A MIXTURE
2558,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SOL IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES
2559,THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A MIXTURE,THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A MIXTURE
2560,THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS THAT THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED INTO,THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS THAT THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED IN
2561,A SOLVENT HELLO WHAT,HESOLVENT HO E
2562,THE MASS IS INCREASING,THE MASS IS INCREASING
2563,I THINK IT'S A SOLUTION,I THINK ITS E SOLUTION
2564,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT YOU COULD LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A O YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS
2565,A MIXTURE,A MIXTURE
2566,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER,IS THE LITTLE TIDY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT LARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER
2567,I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER,I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
2568,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTALS,HERE WHON TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT AM IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS  WITH NOTHING BUT FOCRYSTAL
2569,SOLUTION,SOLUTION
2570,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU POUR YOU THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS
2571,HERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT,HERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT THE WATER CANNOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT
2572,IT IS EVAPORATING,IT IS EVAPORATOR
2573,YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND,YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND
2574,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT,THAT WHEN WEU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT
2575,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
2576,HERE THE FLOUR IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ONTO THE BOTTOM AND AND THE REST OF THE FLOUR STAYS ON THE TOP IN THE COFFEE FILTER,HERE THE FLOWER IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER ON THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ON TO THE BOTTOM AND AN THE REST OF THE FLOWER STAYS FROM THE TOP IN THE COFEE BILTER
2577,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TWO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTEY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAM
2578,A MIXTURE,A MIXTURE
2579,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS IN THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
2580,GOOD,GOOD
2581,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTIONS,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER IN MAKING SOLUTION
2582,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE ON A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED A MORE GRAM CUBES TE EQUAL THAT
2583,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE,I THINK WITH SAL THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP A HAND A FILTURE DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE
2584,THAT WATER PLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION,THAT WATER TLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION
2585,SURE MARNEY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS,SEREMURNIE SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE SHOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WAY AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION BAST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIXE IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER A THAT RAY AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS
2586,THE SALT,THE THULT
2587,THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE,THE SALT IS HA SULVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE
2588,ONE KIND OF GRAMS PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS GRAM TOGETHER,ONE KIND OF GRAHAM PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAHAM EQUAL SYGRAM TOGETHER
2589,THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE,THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE
2590,YOU COULD LET IT EVAPORATE,YOU CUN LET IT AVAPARADES
2591,NO,NO
2592,TIME,TIME
2593,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE AND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL,IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNIE WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THANG AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE WA IN THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL A WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE IN FERON
2594,I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION,I NOTICE THAT THE CECCITRIC ACID IS BEIN POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOURE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL IT GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION
2595,THE SAND AND IN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE THE SAND STAYS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YOU IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT,THE SANDIN IN THE SANDAND WATER MAKE SURE THIS THE SAND SHAKES OF THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YE THE IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT
2596,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE
2597,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT,THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT
2598,I KNOW THAT NOTICE THAT SALT IS BEING MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP WITH THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER,I KNOW THE NOTICE THAT SALT IS BE MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP OF THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER
2599,OKAY,OKEH
2600,UM CAUSE I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE,IM BECAUSE I THINK THE' THE EASIER TO USE
2601,WELL IT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILLIMETERS CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOOR TO SOMETHING OR HOLD IT AND THEN MEASURE UP TO YOU COULD DO THAT AND STUFF,WELL IT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILIMET OR SENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOOR TO SOMETHING OR A WHOLE DED AND MEASURE UP TO COULD DO THAT ANDSTO
2602,HOLD THE TAPE MEASURE LIKE I SAID AND THEN MAKE THEM LEAVE OFF LIKE I SAID UM AND THEN MEASURE UP FROM THERE,WHAT'S IMPORTANT MARNE IS THAT UM YOU SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU SHOULD
2603,UM YOU WOULD BEGIN AT ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND THEN END AT THE OTHER SIDE,OM YOU WOULD BEGIN AT ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE AN THE END AT THE OTHER SIDE
2604,IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO HEIGHT UM N SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE BY TO YOUR HEIGHT REALLY BY TO YOUR HEIGHT YEAH,IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO HEIGHT UM SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE CLOSE TO YOUR HEIGHT REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR HEIGHT YE
2605,WAIST TO KNEE AND STUFF,WAISTHER KNEE AND STUFF
2606,UM INCHES CENTIMETERS AND MILLIMETERS,UM INCHES CENIMETERS AND MILIMETERS
2607,IT'S EASIER TO MEASURE,IT'S EASIER TO MEASURE
2608,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BEGIN ANYWHERE YOU REALLY WOULDN'T MEASURE,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BAGIN ANYWHERE YOU REALLY WON'T MEASURE
2609,HI HI MARNEY,I HI MURNY
2610,MARNIE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT,MARNIE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

2824,WHEN THEY BOTH ON THE BOTTOM YEAH IT DOESN'T TURN ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING THAT WAY BUT WHEN ONCE ON THE SIDE AND ONCE UNDERNEATH THAN IT COULD WORK,WHEN THEY'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM EM IT DOESN'T TURN ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING THAT WAY BUT WHEN ONE'S ON THE SIDE AN ONE'S UNDERNEATH THEN IT COULD WORK
2825,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2826,IT CHANGES WHILE GOING THE OTHER WAY AROUND,IT CHANGES WHILE GOING THE OTHER WAY ROUND
2827,A D CELL BATTERY,ADE SE BATTERY
2828,THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE D CELL BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT THE LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE D CELL,THE ELECTRICITIES GOING TO DESEIL BATTERING THE OUT THE DECAIL BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BALB AN OUT THE LIGHT BALB BACK TO THE DECEIL
2829,THAT IS THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY,THAT AT THE ELECTRICITIIS GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED A DIFFERENT WAY
2830,UM IT GETS ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES TO LIGHT BULB,DARK UM IT GETS ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT THE FROM THE UM BATTERY TO THE WIRES TO LIGHTBALL
2831,I'M DOING GOOD,AM DOING GOOD
2832,I THINK IT WOULD GET BRIGHTER TO BREAK THE BULB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK,I THINK IT WOULD GET BRIGHTER TO BREAK THE BOB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK
2833,IT GOES BACKWARDS SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT IS GOING BEFORE,IT GOES BACKWARDS SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT WAS GOING BEFORE
2834,IT FLOWS BECAUSE IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY TO THE WIRES BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE WIRES KIND OF GET THE ELECTRICITY AND GOES THROUGH INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN,IT FLOWS BECAUSE IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY TO THE WIRES BECAUSE IT'S THE WIRES KIND OF GET THE ELECTRICIAN IT GOES THROUGH INTO THE LIGHT BALL AN THE

3047,YES,YES
3048,THE POWER THROUGH THE BATTERY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE WIRES AND GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT WORK,THE POWER THROUGH THE BATTERY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE WIRES AND GOING TO THE LIPLE TO MAKE IT WORK
3049,YEAH,YE
3050,THEN UM THE WIRES WOULDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING,AN UM THO WIRES WOULDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING
3051,JUST ONE JUST TWO PATHWAYS ARE OUT OF THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER TWO ARE CONNECTED TO THOSE TWO WIRES,JUST WHEN JUST TWO PATHWAYS ARE AT THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER TWO ARE CONNECTED TO THOSE TWO WIRES
3052,YES THE SI THE SIDES OF THE BULB BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT TO BOTH SIDES,YES THE SI THE SIDES OF THE BALL BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT TO BOTH SIDES
3053,YOU JUST ATTACH IT TO THE BATTERY AND THEN ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB GOES ON,JUST ATTACH IT TO THE BATTERY AND THEN ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE LIGHTBULB GOES ON
3054,WHAT,WHY
3055,THEY'RE ALL MOVING IN ONE DIRECTION THEY GO UP AND CURVE TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN COME BACK AND GO TO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO BACK TO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO TO THE BATTERY AGAIN,OR ALL MOVING ONE DIRECTION THEY GO UP AND CURVE TO THE LIPALB AND THEN COME BACK AND GO TO THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GO BACK TO THAT OTHER ONE AND THEN GO TO THE BATTERY AGAIN
3056,IT MAKES THE WIRES COME FROM THE BATTERY FROM THE RIGHT END AND THEN GO RIGHT UP AND THEN MAKE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS STAY UP THERE,OR MAKE THE WIRES COME FROM THE BATTERY FROM THE WIDE END AND THEN GO RIGHT UP AND TEN MAKE THE TWO WIPE ALLS STANP THERE
3057,NO CAUSE THE ONE FURTHER AWAY IS UM ISN'T MORE BRIGHT AS THE ONE UP FRONT,NOT BECAUSE THE ONE FURTHER AWAY IS UM ISN'T MORE BRIGHT AS THE LAN UP FIND
3058,ONE OF THE WIRES IS GOING TO EACH SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB,ONE OF THE WIRES IS GOING TO EACH SIDE OF THA LIGHT BALL

3649,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
3650,THERE'S A BIG GAP OF AIR,THERE'S A BIG GAP OF AIR
3651,YEAH IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE S IT AS ON THE SOAPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS,IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE IT AS ON THE SOPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENT
3652,THAT IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER IT STARTS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN IT STARTS GETTING ON THE WHOLE PENNY,THAT IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER IT SCARTS IN THE MIDDLE THAT IT STARTS GETTING ON THE WHOLE PENNY
3653,CORRECT,RECKED
3654,BECAUSE IT KEEPS GETTING IT'LL KEEP GETTING HIGHER AND IT'LL SPREAD IT OUT MORE,BECAUSE IT KEEPS GITTING  IT'LL KEEP GETTING HIGHER AND I'LL SPREAD IT OUT MORE
3655,WELL ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT'S STAYING FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF,WELL ON THE SOPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH STAINE FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF
3656,IT FLIES EVERYWHERE,AND FLIES EVERYWHERE
3657,THAT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MICROSCOPE IT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER ONCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY,THAT WEN YER WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GITTING BIGGER AND AN IT KINDA LIKE A MECROSCOPE THAT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER WHENCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY
3658,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN WE'RE WE WERE SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER AND SALT WATER ON THE PENNY,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN TE BIRD SING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER IN SALT WATER ON THE PENNY
3659,OH UM WELL WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF ONCE YOU G PUT A LOT ON IT WILL START COMING OFF Y OR ELSE IT'LL START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP,OH EM WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP KITTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF WONCE YOU PUT A LOT ON IL STIRT COMING OFF ORLE START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP
3660,HAVE N WELL CAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER,HAVE WELL BECAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THAN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AD BIGER AN BIGGER AN BIGGER AND BIGGER AN BIGGER ND BIGGER AND BIGGER
3661,GOOD,GOOD
3662,ON THE SALT WATER IT'S TALLE,ON THE SALT WATERTS COLL
3663,ON SOMETHINGS LIKE CARPET IT WOULD PROBABLY JUST BREAK BUT ON WAX PAPER OR SOMETHING IT'LL STAY LIKE A DOME,UN SOMETHINGSLIKE CARPET IT WOULD PROBABLY JUST BREAK BUT ON WAX PAPER OR SOMETHING ELSE STAY LIKE A DOME
3664,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFACE IT'S ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IS IT IS ON ON SOME SURFACES IT'LL JUST EXPLODE AND YEAH,BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFEITS ITS ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IS IT IS ONT ON SOME SURFACES ILL JUST EXPLODE IN YET
3665,IT GETS REALLY REALLY TALL,IT GETS REALLY REALLY TALL
3666,ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S HITS AND IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT TAKES OUT SOME OF THE WATER,ON THE SOPY WATTER IT HITS AN IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT DOTS 'N IT DOESN'TT IT TAKES SHOUT SOME OF THE WATER
3667,SEE YOU LATER TOO BYE,FEE LATE OR TO BY
3668,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF,I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF
3669,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ASORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO N IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH,IT IS COLLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP WARE OF THE WATER SOA IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T AS ORB SOAP CUT TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO IT THAT TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH
3670,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
3671,IT GETS BIGGER,IT GETS BIGGER
3672,THE BATTERY IT IT UM WELL IT HAS ELECTRICITY INSIDE OF IT,THE BATTERY IT ON LORD HAS E ELECTRICITY INSIDE OF IT
3673,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OH WHAT WAS I GONNA CALL IT UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET,UM BUIT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY OH WHAT WAS A CALLED UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET
3674,AND YEAH THAT WHAT I THINK THAT THEY DO WITH THEM MMM HMM,AND YAAS I THINK THEY DO WITH HEM
3675,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED AND WITH THE MAGNETS FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL,CAUSE WE WE LEARNED WITH THE MAGNETS THAT FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL
3676,MMM HMM THEN ALSO YOU COULD USE IT AT A JUNKYARD TO MOVE STUFF AROUND,THEN I'LL SA YOU COULD USE IN A JUNK YARD TO MOVE STUFF ROUND
3677,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACES THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT'D BE PRETTY BAD,COULD JUST USE IT FRUIT FOR CARING PLACE THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES SUDDEN  THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT AM PRETTY BAD
3678,YEP MMM HMM,THE UP AN MIS
3679,UM YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND MORE MORE TIMES,U YOU COULD RAP IT AROUND MORE MORE TIMES
3680,YEAH WHICH IS AT THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET MMM HMM,YE WHICH IS AT THE HEAD OF THE MEN
3681,UM WELL WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THAT PART MY GROUP SO,EM WELL WE DIDN'T REALLY GET TO THAT PART MY GREW SO
3682,NOPE NOPE UM,NO NO I

3686,AND OH WHAT WAS ALL THE ELSE WHAT WAS IT A UM,AND O IWAS ALL  ELSE WAS IT NON
3687,PROBABLY HAS IRON IN IT,PAUL HAS IRED AT IT
3688,UM CAUSE IT WOULD JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY LIKE GET LESS AND LESS AND LESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES MMM HMM,AH BECAUSE I JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY I GET LESS AND LESS AND ELESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES
3689,UM THEY SAID THAT,UM THEY SAID THAT
3690,UM WELL WE HAD MORE THIN WIRE THAN THICK WIRE SO SO BASICALLY THE THINNER WIRE WORKED BETTER,IM MOBY HAD MORE THIN WIRE THAN THICK WIRE SO SO MIS CLY THE DINNER WIRE WORKED BETTER
3691,UM OH LETS SEE THE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE HAVE NO CLUE YEAH ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS,LETSEE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE IHAVE NO CLOYE YENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS
3692,YOU'RE WELCOME YUP,WELL OFCOM HER
3693,PROBABLY YOU CAN WELL PROBABLY YOU CAN ACTIVATE IT EASY MORE EASILY YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF,PROW YOU CAN WELL HOW YOU CAN ACTIVATE ES MARISA YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF
3694,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING,UNC UM SO TO DAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELETRO MAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING
3695,NOPE,NO
3696,NOT REALLY NOPE,NAT REALLY
3697,WELL ELECTROMAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP SINCE THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM,OH ELECTRO MAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THATHESE WERE ROUD ON WHAT SUBSTANCE THEY WERE BUT THERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF OLD THAT'S WHAT I CALL
3698,IRON,IRON
3699,YEP,
3700,TO TEST THE MORE WRAPS OH YEAH LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN WRAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN WRAPS MY GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN AND THEN FOR FIFTY WRAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS MMM HMM,TTESTEMORE RAPS OH YA LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN RAPS AND THE WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN RAPS MIGHT GROUP THEN UM GOD CYRO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN THEN FOR FIFTY RAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS
3701,AND,AND
3702,AS I SAID I THINK IT'S UM AS A BY IT'S CLOSER TO THE THE RIVET,AS I SAID I THINK IT'S UM AS THE CLOSE IT'S CLOSER TO THE ELL GET RID IT
3703,WHAT UM,ILY
3704,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNET YOU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MMM HMM UH HUH,A WELL YOU COULD CARRY YOU SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNETE YOUU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOUD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WIT LIKE A CAR ON A
3705,THE TO THE RIVET N AND WOULD,THA TO THE RIVOT AND AND WOOD
3706,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETISM WELL THE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IT CAN AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WORLD WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO AS THAT DOES N'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR AN THE MAGNET COULD BE LEARNT AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETLE THE MAGNET UNIT U THAT I AS THA IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO I BE MORE POWERFUL IF HE PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET
3707,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP WELL PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM,IT'S I THINK IT'S YORK  AN WHILE THEY USUALLY USED IT AT DUMSTERS TO PICK UP TE PLACES GARBAGE SHEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM
3708,THEN WHAT ELSE COULD YOU USE IT UM,THEN KTSA UM
3709,UM WELL,AM MO
3710,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S ALL WELL IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICIS AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAG WELL I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT YEAH,THE RIVER IT'S AM IT'S A BOLT SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECE TRESSES AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAGBLE WIDE SAY WASHERS USO AS YET
3711,WORKS BETTER MMM HMM,WORKS BETTER E
3712,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVE IT MORE ENERGY ES CAUSE IT'S CLOSER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT'D BE UH HUH,UM YULL SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY ISCAUSE IT'S CLOSER DOES IT HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD ITOULD BE MORE EYD BE
3713,THEY HAVE THE METAL INSIDE OF THEM THAT TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY I THINK AND THEN THE RIVET ACTS AS A,THEY HAVE THE METAL INSIDE OF THEM THAT TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY I THINK AND THEN THE RIVIT ACTS AS A
3714,I LIKE PICKING UP THINGS,ELD PICKING UP THINGS
3715,NO MMM HMM,NOW RIATS AND YE
3716,WELL WHAT HAPPENED,WELL WHAT HAPPENED
3717,YEP MMM HMM,NES STO
3718,NOPE JUST PICK UP LITTLE METAL THINGS,NOPE DISPIC OF LITTLE MELE THINKS
3719,FOR IT TO WORK MMM HMM,FOR IT TO WORK
3720,PROBABLY MIGHT USE IT WELL YOU COULD USE IT FOR CLEANING ROOMS THAT WOULD BE PRETTY HANDY,POLLY MY USIT WELL COULD USE IT FOR CLEANING RIMS AVE AT PRETTY HANDY
3721,MMM HMM AND THAT MAGNET WAS JUST PICKING IT UP WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY OR BATTERIES OR WIRES,IN THAT MAGNANT WAS JUST PICKING UP WITHOUT AN ELECTRICITY OR BATTERIES OR WIRES
3722,NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN JUST UH HUH,NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN JUST A HA
3723,MAYBE THE WIRES MAKE IT UM MAGNETISM SO MAKE IT LIKE A MAGNET SO IT CAN PICK UP THOSE WASHERS,MAYBE THE WIRES MAKE A MAGNETISM SO MAKE IT LIKE A MAGNET SO CAN PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
3724,UM I HAVE NO CLUE,I'VE NO CLUE IS
3725,UH HUH YEP,AH POCHES MAE UP
3726,YEAH BEFORE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PICK ANYTHING UP,YEAH BEFORE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED MAKING LUCTRO MAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END IN A WOODEN POKE ANYTHING OF
3727,WE TRIED TO SEE DID IT MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE H HOW DOES IT DO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE,WE TRIED TO SEE DIDN'T MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO HOUT DOS DIP  MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE
3728,WE PICKED UP MORE WASHERS MMM HMM,WE PUCKED UP MORE WASHERS
3729,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY MMM HMM,WILL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE THE ELECELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY
3730,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD'VE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAG UM WELL A ELECTRICITY SO UM,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD HAVE EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE NA UM W ELECTRICITY SO A
3731,GOT STRONGER UH HUH,THE STRONGER AH
3732,POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL,OSITIVE SIDE OF THE DIS
3733,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDT OF IT AND WANT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WIPOB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
3734,THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIPELM
3735,POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE,POSITITIVE AND NEGATIVE
3736,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP,THE WHITE BALB IS NOTGETING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSEERES NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IS NOT LIGHTING UP
3737,THE CAN THE CON WHAT'S THAT,BACGAIN THE CON MOSSATT
3738,YES,ES
3739,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A M NOT MAG A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT UP,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A NIT UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIPE BLL UNLIGHT UP
3740,UM SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS,SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE WHITE BALB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS
3741,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE,OU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BALB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE
3742,WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL AND ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB,WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE DSELLEN ATTACHMENT TO THE LIPE OB
3743,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCKED MY FINGER,I ATTACHED TO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCK MY FINGER
3744,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES IN THAT A CLOSE CIRCUIT
3745,GOOD,GUIDE
3746,WHICH END IS ON THE POSITIVE AND WHICH END'S ON THE NEGATIVE,WHICH IND IS ON THE POSITIVE AN MITONS ON THE NEGATIVE
3747,CLOSED,CLOSED
3748,THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT F IF WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE AND POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM,THE WHITEBOB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT IF WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE IN POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM
3749,THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF POWER,THE DETAIL IS THE SOURCE OF POWER
3750,CELLS ARE NINE NINE ARE NINE VOLT BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB M LIGHT UP,SELLS AR NINE NUN AR NINE BOAT BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE THE LIGHT BUB LIGHT UP
3751,THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF,THE BALB SHOWS YOU OF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AN THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
3752,THE GREEN AREAS BY OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE UM D CELL AND ON ONE SIDE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S THAT ONE UM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT'S SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND KNOW WHICH ONE WHICH SIDE SWITCHED,THE GREEN AREAS CLOSED OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS IN SIDE OF THE I'M DESAIL IN ON ONE SIDE ON THEEPOSITIVE SIDE THERE'S TAT ONE OM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND NOTWHITCH I DWITCHED
3753,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE UM,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE
3754,IT LETS THE WIRES GET ENERGY SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE LIGHT IT CAN UM LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES,IT LETS THE WIRES GET IN HER CEE SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE WHIHT IT CAN UNLIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT' WUN THROUGH THE WIRES
3755,THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WIRES IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE D CELL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE IT WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE,THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHTBALL BUSN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WILERS IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE DESAIL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE  WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE
3756,IT IS RIGHT AND THE REST OF THEM ARE NOT,IT IS RIGHT AND THE REST OF THEM ARE NOT
3757,WELL THE BATTERY'S A D CELL AND IT HAS POG POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE LIGHT BULB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIRE,WHILE THE BATTERY IS A DESAILL AND IT HAS POGPOSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE WHITE BALB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIRE
3758,THE CONDUCTING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM AND TO THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES IT LIGHTS UP,E CONDUCTING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM INTO THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES THAT LIGHTS UP
3759,IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST CIRCUIT THOUGH THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL COMING BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT,IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST TIRCUIT THOUGH THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL COMING BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT

3779,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND ETULATORS
3780,BECAUSE A WIRE IS LIKE A CONDUCER BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON LIKE A NAIL OR PAPER CLIP SO THAT IT CAN CONDUCT ELECTRICITY,BECAUSE A WIRE IS LIKE IKE A CONDUCI BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON LIKE A NAIL OR PAPER CLUP SO THAT IT CAN CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
3781,WHEN THE STRAW IS TRYING TO DID WHAT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT'S STILL OPEN,WHEN THE STRAW IS TRYING TO DO BUT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSE CIRCUIT IS STILL OPEN
3782,IRON,IRON
3783,WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK,WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METLE IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
3784,IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH AND IT'S CLOSED AND YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR AND ATTACH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH THE SWITCH WILL START UM THE SWITCH WILL START WORKING AND THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB WILL GO ON,IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH AND ITS CLOSE AND YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR AND ATTACH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH THE SWITCH WILL START UM THE WICH WILL START WORKING AND THE MOTOR OR LIBALB WILL GO ON
3785,GOOD,GUIDE
3786,A NAIL CAN MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE L SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTOR S,ANAIL COULD MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTER
3787,ALL THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METAL,ALL THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METALE
3788,THEY'RE COVERED WITH PLASTIC,THEY'RE COVERED WITH PLASTIC
3789,WHEN THE NAIL TOUCHES THE CONDUCTOR WELL WHEN THE NAIL IS THE CONDUCTOR AND IT TOUCHES THE SWITCH IN THE END OF THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND,WHEN THE NAIL TOUCHES THE CONDUCTOR BUT WHEN THE NAIL IS THE CONDUCTOR AND IT TOUCHES THE SWITCH IN THE IND OF THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND
3790,THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS,THERE IS ONE DECEILLIN TWO BALBS
3791,I THINK WE HAVE PARALLELS BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE IT ISN'T AS DIM AS WELL IT'S NOT AS DIM AS ONE CIRCUIT BUT IT'S AS IT'S LIGHTER THAN THAT CIRCUIT BUT IT'S THE SAME CIRCUIT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS,I THINK WE HAVE PARALLELS BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE IT ISN'T AS DIM AS WELL IT'S NOT AS DIM AS ONE CIRCUIT BUT IT DOES ITS LIGHTERS IN THAT CIRCUIT BUTS THE SAME CIRCUIT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS
3792,I SEE ON THE LEFT THERE'S A NON PARALLEL AND I SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE IS,I SEE ON THE WEF THERE'S A NON PARL OW WHEN I SEE IN THE RIGHT THERE
3793,YES,YES
3794,IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONES THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL,IT HAS TWOLIPE BUBS IN ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONE SID WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIKE BUBS IN ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL
3795,GOES BACK IN THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,OES BACK IN THE DETAIL ON THE POSITTIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3796,WELL THAT THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB REPRESENTS THE TWO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IT'S IN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT UM AND HOW IT WORKS,WELL THAT THE THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BALL PRESENTS THE TO THE WHITE BALB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IT ITSIN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT U AND HOW IT WORKS
3797,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH PARALLEL CIRCUITIS A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE AN HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
3798,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN UM A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THROW F FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN A A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND CHOS INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THROUGH FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFFED LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WHERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES

3802,WELL SINCE OUR LIGHT ARE STILL LIT UP LIKE IN OUR DOWNSTAIRS THEY ARE REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IN ONE ROOM IT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY STARTS IN OUR HOUSE AND LIGHTS IT UP A LOT BRIGHT BRIGHTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE,WELL SINCE OUR A LIGHT OR SO LIT UP LIKE IN OR DOWNSTAIRS THEY ARE REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IN ONE ROOM IT'S WEAR THE ELECTRICITY STARTS IN OUR HOUSE AND MIGHT SIT UP ELABRAT BRIGHTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
3803,THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULBS AND ETC ETC,THE BLUE DOT ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES LIGHTING A FLI BALB AND GOING BOUT THROUGH THE DESAIL LIGHTING UP THE LIPOBS AND ET CETERA ET CETERA
3804,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS,HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
3805,YES,
3806,YES,YES
3807,ONE IS THE BATTERY AND TWO ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,ONE IS THE BATTERY AND TWO ARE THE LIPULBS
3808,THAT IT IS MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THAT IT IS MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
3809,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT,THE PARALLEL CIR COUL DARE NOT SHARING TO THEY WITE UP WATHER THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRIC TO DE SO THAF THEY DON'T LIGT UP APRAT
3810,I SEE,I SEE
3811,IT IS GOING THROUGH ONE END OF THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING BULBS UP AGAIN AND THEN GOING AND THEN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,IT IS GOING THROUGH ANE AND OF THE DEE SAIL WLIDING UP THE BALB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE DEE SAIL HINDING THE BULBS UP AGAIN AND IN  JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3812,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOLWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE
3813,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE D CELL FLOW THROUGH THROW THROUGH ONE HI ONE LIGHT BULB LIGHTED UP AND THEN COME BACK TO THE D CELL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND COME BACK TO THE D CELL,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE DESAIL FLOW THROUGH THROW THROUGH ONE IT ONE LIGHT BALL BLIGHTED UP AND NCOME BACK TO THE ESAILL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BALB AND COME BACK TO THE DESAIL
3814,I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT

3864,FOUR METERS SORRY I MEAN IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS,FOUR METERS SORRY ILOOK TOJUS WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE LINES
3865,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,O MA IT LOOKS LIKE MISS ROBOTT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR THE PLAIN WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINES AND YE
3866,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,UM BUT WE'RE JUST EARN THE JUST CAN TI MAKE A COOLOOKONCHOUTAND LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER WITH A RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'SCANI LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE IM YOUHAT THE PROPELLER POWERAN AND THEN WRGING TO TRIPUNNING PASSENGERS RON TO SEE IF IT EFFECTS IT WHICH AR THE PASSENGERSE ARE PAPER ECLIPSE AND YE
3867,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERDS THAT THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST GING TO SIT THERE
3868,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT TE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USED TO BUILD IT THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
3869,S SO,R SO
3870,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THE THE FIGHT FLAGHTLINE LOOKS LIKE ITS GOING UP WORD AND YE HAD LOOK WELL AVE LOOKS LIKE IT TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YE
3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,AM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLAIN AND THIS YER WEALL SEE HOW FAR IT'S CAN IT GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE A PRETTY FAR FORMED METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINES SO YEH
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH I TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT I ELSO NEED SOME WE ELSE SO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRE IS TO GO IN AND READ ME LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE WORLDS LIKE STAY ON SET THE WIRE QUARK WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YAN I WE JUST KIND TO HAVE PAPER UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
3873,HI,HI
3874,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO WHERE HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S THAT YOU CAN DECIDE BUT T E HOW FAST YOU WANTED TO GO HOW FAR ISROLLA DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE
3875,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,IM WELL AR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT I'M 'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE 'N HALF WAY ITS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AN IM TIS WELL IT TURNET IT LOOKS HERE THAT THIS RAFT WOULDN'T BE CORRECT BECAUSE IS SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR US TO GO I'M SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERED ONLY SAYS TWENTY TWO WINES FOR TWO METERS SO TAT BE INCORRECT AND IM YE
3876,W WELL WE HAVE A S WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN IN HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THIS S PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND THE PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE,WELL WE HAVE A WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES IN THE WIRE AND THEN I'M HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DAC DOWN THAT WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THAN WE JUST HAVE THE SUPERPELLER PIECE OR RUBBER BAND AND A PIECE IGLOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLAN
3877,UM ONE THING THAT AFFECT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAN AFFECT IT IS THE TYPE OF STRING IN OUR CASE WE'RE DOING FISHING WIRE BUT T IT COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING OR UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS AND THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS,I'M ONE THING NOT IT AFFECTEAS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THATI C AFFECTED IS A TYPE OF STRING AND ARCIS WUDING FISHING WIRE BUT YOU COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOUR USING THERE A MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINS IN THE TYPE OF STRING ARE TO THE MAIN THINGS
3878,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ANGLED LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CL IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT,WELL SINGLE DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S A FOR EXAMPLE IT 'SINGLE LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GOIN TO GET ANYWHERE AN IF YOU IF YO IF IT'S JUST A SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M IF YOU'RE CLIMBING AT A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT
3879,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS UP WE WANT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE WO A YARD AND A HALF,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN IRCE BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS IF WE WANT BUT THE GOL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE A YARD AND A HALF
3880,UM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND,WE NEED I OULD THINK ABOUT HEMANY WINES WE MAKE AND WE NEED OF CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND
3881,WELL THE THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE ON THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER,WELL THOUGH THE BOTTOM ONE THET'S NOT CAN FLY AS FAR BECAUSE IT'S AIMT UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE OF THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER
3882,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAKE AIRPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAGER PLANS ZECHO ON FISHING WIRE
3883,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU'LL YOU COULD CHANGE,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE IS FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF ITS LONGER ONE ARE SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOE AR THE MAN THINGS YOU YOU COULD CHANGE
3884,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE,IT LOOKS LIKE THERY MADE A PLAN JUST LIKE US AND I'M IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLAIN
3885,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FORTY FIVE,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WHEN FORTY FI
3886,BYE,MA
3887,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GO BUMPY AND THEN IT'LL LIKE AFFECT IT AND WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEED A WELL THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOOTH LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR UH STEEP UP OR ELSE IT'LL UM THEN IT'LL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT SAID IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GITLL BUMPY IN A LITTLE LIKE AFFECTIT AND WELL YO'T I YOU NEED E YOU LSASE WELL THAT'S PRYOU JUST NEED O HAVE A NICE SMOOTH LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR STEEP OPERALS IT ALL UM WELL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YE
3888,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS,WELL THAT JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEIDA MAKE IT GO FARTHER IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEEDA CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY IN YOU SEEM LIKE CHANGE THE WINE SIR SO ITS JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS
3889,WHAT,WHY
3890,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,WELL YOU YUSOR OL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLAN AND YOU SAW A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
3891,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING,AMATRIC RULER OR SOMETHING
3892,YEAH YEAH THAT'S,YERE YET
3893,HI,HI
3894,THERE'S ONE HUNDRED,IS ONE HUNDRED
3895,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F N,THEN YE SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL AND
3896,YEAH,YE
3897,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS,WE GOT UP WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQLE STRAWS
3898,A RULER YEAH,UN A RULER LORD COMIFIXEH E
3899,Y LIKE THIS,REAYY LIKE THIS
3900,YES YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY,YES FATHER YES  WE MOT GOTHEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY
3901,YEAH,HERE
3902,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING
3903,BECAUSE I WAS OUR S THE STRAWS ON OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE'S SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT,BECAUSE OURS OUR THE STRAWS AT OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLES SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT
3904,YEAH,YE
3905,WE LEARNED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM CAN,BEELER AND TAT AND NECCHIC SYSTEM CAN
3906,IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THE,IT'S AVOUNT MEASURING THE
3907,YEAH,YES
3908,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL
3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEDERS
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS AND THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING THUS THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE MATIC SYSTEM SO WEASE AND MECRI SYSTEM TOO CONTACT WITH THE VER COUNTRY
3911,OH NO,ON NOW
3912,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF WE'RE ONE METRIC ONE METER HIGH NO,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE I GIVE WER ONE TAT CHICK ONE METER HIGH KNOW
3913,TEN,CAN
3914,WE USED A,LESA
3915,THEN YOU,THEN YOU
3916,STRAWS,STRIES
3917,UH WHEN IT'S STANDARD THAT MEANS IT'S ALL THE SAME WHICH MAKES IT WHICH MAKES YOUR WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING THE SAME WHEN IT WHEN IT'S EQUAL,HE WHEN ITS STANDARD THAT MEANS ITS ALL THE SAME WHICH MAKES IT WHICH MAKES HER WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING THE SAME WHEN IT WHEN IT'S EQUAL
3918,BECAUSE THE METER TAPE HAS ONE HUNDRED DECAMETERS,BECAUSE THE METER TAPE HAS ONE HUNDRED DECKO METERS
3919,YEAH YEAH,HE OS LETTHERS AN HERE
3920,YEAH,YES
3921,UH YOU N IT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG OR HOW WIDE OR HOW TALL IT IS,EH YOUIT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG OR HOW WIDE OR HOW TALL IT IS
3922,IT WAS ALL,IT WAS ALL
3923,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME ANSWER,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME AUNT SARA
3924,IT WAS A PAPERY AND LONG,ILL IS U PAPERY AND LONG
3925,WE DIDN'T GET A THREE OR A FOUR OR,WE DIDN'T GET A THREE OR FOUR SIR
3926,THEY'RE LITTLE LINES,THERE THOSE LITTLE LINES
3927,BEC SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHERE THE DECAMETER WAS AND THE CENTIMETER,BE SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHAT THE DECOMETERALIZE AN A SENDEN MEDER
3928,NO,NOW
3929,OH THERE'S TEN IN ONE DECAMETER,OH THERE'S PEN IN NO ONE DECOEE
3930,THEN WE GOT M WE DIDN'T GET A WHOLE NUMBER,THEN WE GOT WE DIDN'T GET A WHOLE NUMBER
3931,THEY WERE CUT UNEQUALLY,THEY WERE CUT UNEQUALLY
3932,THAT'S THAT'S TEN CENTIMETERS,THAT'S SOITHAT'S TEN CENAMETRS
3933,THAT MEANS IT'S,THAT MEANS ITS
3934,YEAH,YET
3935,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS INTO ONES THAT WERE EQUAL,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS INTO ONCE THAT WERE EQUAL
3936,YEAH,HER
3937,THAT THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN IT,AT THEIRS TEN CENTERS IIT
3938,ONE FIFTH OF A,ONE FAR EVER
3939,BECAUSE THERE'S AN EMPTY IN FRONT OF AN E T IN FRONT OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THEN AN M E T IN FRONT OF THE METER,BECAUSE THERE IS AN NT IN FRONT OF MIT IN FRONT OF THE MATRIC SYSTEM AND NMIT IN FRONT OF A METER
3940,TO MEASURE OUR DESKS WITH,TO MASUR OR DESKS WITH
3941,YEAH UH IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY AGREES ON AND,YE A IT'S SOMETHING AT EVERYBODY AGREESIGN AND
3942,NO,NOW
3943,UH YOU CAN MEASURE,AH YOU CAN MEASURE O
3944,YEAH WE MEASURED IT WITH A UNEQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR OUR FOR HOW HOW BIG OUR DESKS ARE,YAH WE MEASURED IT WITH AN UNEQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR ER FOR O HOW BIG OUR DESKS ARE
3945,UM MEASUREMENTS UH THE METRIC SYSTEM,O MEASUREMENT SE RESOL NOT EH THE METRIC SYSTEM
3946,YOU COULD TELL IF IT WAS FIVE OR,HE COULD TELL IF IT WAS FIBER
3947,YES,YES
3948,THAT MEANS THAT THE UNEQUAL LENGTH STRAWS WERE WEREN'T THE RIGHT SIZE BUT THE EQUAL STRAWS WERE THE RIGHT SIZE,THAT MEANS THAT THE UNEQUAL LINK STRAWS WERE WEREN'T THE RIGHT SIZE BUTTHE EQUAL STRAWS WERE THE RIGHT SIZE
3949,TEN,COME
3950,MOST OF THE PEOPLE GOT THREE AND OUR TEAM GOT FOUR,MOST OF THE FE FL GOT THREE AND AR TEAM GOT FOUR
3951,THE METRIC SYSTEM,TMAGIC SYSTEM
3952,NO,YOU KNOW
3953,A YOU CAN MEASURE AROUND IT WHEN IT'S A METER TAPE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO GO AROUND,EH YOU CAN MEASURE AROUND IT WHEN IT'S SO MEATER TAKE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO GO AROUND
3954,FIVE OR ONE OR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR ANY OF THE NUMBERS UNDER TEN UH UH FOR DECAMETERS,FIVE OR ONE OR TWO OR THREE O FOUR OR ANY OF THE NUMBERS UNDER TEN OF A FOUR DECK OF MEATERS
