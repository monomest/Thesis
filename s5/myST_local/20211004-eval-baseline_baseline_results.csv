423,UM ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE FIRST WIRE AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE SWITCH GOES TWIST AND THEN IT PICKED UP THE WASHERS AND THEN IT KEPT KEPT KEPT ON GOING TO THE BATTERY AGAIN AND THEN IT WENT AGAIN,AM ALL THELECTICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE FIRST LIER AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE WAGE GOS TWIST AND THEN IT PICKED UP THE THE WASHERS AND THEN IT C A CAP KEPT ON GROWING TO THE BETTER AGAIN AND THEN I WIN AGAIN
424,UM IT KEPT IT KEEPS ON GOING AND THEN IT KEEPS THEM UM UP SO SO UM SO AND THEN IF YOU TUR IF YOU DROPPED THOSE AND YOU TURNED OFF THE SWITCH UM YOU CAN PICK UP MORE,IM E CAPT I KEEPS ON GROWING AND THEN IT KEEPS THEM IM UP SO SO IM SO AND THEN IF YOU DO A YOU DROP THOSE EN YOU TURN UP TE SWITCH IM YOU CAN PICK UP MORE
425,THING THE,THIN THE
426,THE IT'LL THE UM ELECTRICITY WILL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND TWIST AND THEN WHEN YOU TOUCH IT WHEN IT'S GOING WHEN IT THE SWITCH IS ON IT'LL PICK UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE UM IT'S ACTING LIKE A MAGNET SO IT'LL PICK IT UP,THUM TO THE O ACTRESITY WILL GO ALWAYS TO TWIST AND THEN WHEN YOU TOUCH IT WHEN IT'S GOING WHEN IT THE SWITCH IS ON IT'LL PICK UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE OM IT'S ACTLLY LEK OMMEND IT SO ITILL PICK IT UP
427,AND YOU CAN UM TURN ON LIGHT BULBS WITH THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY,AND YOU CAN ON TURN ON LIPE BOBS WITH THE SWITCH IN THE BATTERY
428,WHEN YOU'RE GO WHEN IT'S ON YOU CAN DO DIFFERENT THINGS WITH IT YOU CAN UM PICK UP WASHERS WHEN IT AC IT'S ER MAG,WHEN YOU ARE WHEN IT'S ANT YOU CAN DO DIFFERENT THINGS WITH IT YOU CAN AM PICK UP WASHERS WHEN I ACT WHEN IT'S A NA
429,UM THEY'RE LIKE THEY DO WITH ELECTRICITY,AN THERE LIKE THEY DO WITH ELECTICITY
430,UM THE WHILE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH UM IT PIP PICK UPS PICK UPS THE UM WASHERS AND THEN IF YOU GO IF YOU PUT IT DOWN MORE IT'LL PICK UP A FEW MORE WHILE THE ELECTRICITY'S STILL GOING THROUGH,ON THE WHILE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ON A PICK PICK UP PICK UP THE ON WASHERS AND THE IF YOU'L GOT A FEW PUT HER DOWN MORE THE'LL PICK UP A FEW MORE WHILE THE ELECTRICITY SLOW GOING THROUGH
431,S,
432,THE THE THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES ARE AT THE SAME TI TIME PICKING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE UM IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MAGNET,THA THE THE ELECTRICI TAT FOS THROUGH THE WIRES ARE AT THE SAMETY THESAME TIME PICKING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE ON IT'S KIND OF LIKE OF MAGNET
433,GOOD,GED
434,WHEN THE SWITCH CLO CLOSED THE UM IT IT AT THE SAME TIME IT PICKED UP THE WASHERS,WHEN THE SWITCH CLUK CLOSE THE ON IT IT AT THE SAME TIME IT PICKED UP THE WASHERS
435,UM PICK UP,AH PICK UP
436,UM WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MAG MAGNET AND THEN MAGNETS CAN PICK UP THINGS IT LIKE WASHERS AND HERE UM THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTING LIKE THE THE UM LIKE LIKE A MAGNET SO IT PICKS UP THE WA THE WASHERS,UM WA IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MAG MAGNET AND THEN MAGNETS CAN PICK UP THINGS LIKE WASHERS AND HERE UM THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTING LIKE THE THE UM I LIKE A MAGNET SO PICKS UP THE W THE WASHERS
437,WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND THEY'RE NOT UM TOUCHING THE WASHERS,WHEN THEY'RE GOIN THROUGH AN YER NOT UM TOUCHING THE WASHERS
438,BECAUSE IF IT'S OPEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT WHEN WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT IT IT'S LIKE LIKE IF YOU TURN ON A LIGHT SWITCH AND IT'S UP OR IT'S GONNA IT'S GONNA IF IT WAS ONE OF THESE IT WOULD BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND AND NOT AN OPEN CIRCUIT WHEN IT THE LIGHT'S OFF,BECAUSE IF IT'S OPEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND WHENC CLOTHED IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT WHEN WHEN IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT IT IIT'S LIKE IKE IF YOU TURN ON A LIGHT SOICH AND IT'S UP WHAITS GAN  ITS CONNET IF IT WAS ONE OF THESE IT WOULD BE A CLOSE CIRCUT ANC ANORA OPEN CIRCUIT WHEN IT THE LIGHTS OFF
439,UM IT YOU UM IT WON'T PICK ANYTHING UP BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S LIKE A MAGNET IT CAN'T PICK UP THINGS WHEN IT'S REALLY FAR AWAY FROM IT AND UM WHEN IT'S BY TO THEM UM YOU CAN ER PICK THEM UP,AM I I AM IT WON'T PICK ANYTHING UP BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S LIKE A MAGNET IT CAN'T PICK UP THINGS WHEN IT'S REALLY FAR AWAY FROM EM AND  WHEN IT'S CLOSE TO THEM AM YOU CAN A PICK THEM UP
440,UM WELL FROM THE BATTERY THE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE SWITCH AND WHEN THE SWITCH ON IS ON IT GOES TO THE THE THE WHAT'S IT CALLED UM THE OTHER WIRE AND THEN FROM THERE IT GO IT GOES TWISTING AROUND AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE THING AND WHEN YOU TOUCH THE WASHERS THEY'LL LIKE GO PICK UP,AM WELL FROM THE BATTERY THE TH I'LL JUST OU GOES TO THE WITCH AND WHEN THE SWITCH ANT IS ON IT GOES TO THE THE THERE WAS A CALT AH THE OTHER WIRE AND THEN FROM THERE IT GO IT GOES TWISTING ROUND AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE THINK AND WHEN YOU TOUCH THE WASHERS THEY'LL LIKE GO PICK UP
441,WHEN,WHEN
442,UM WE START TO WORK WITH ELECTRICAL MAGNETS ER IT'S A UM AND ER TODAY WE ER WE GOT TO,OM WE STARTED TO WORKWITH ELECTRICCO MAGNETS AND TIS AM AUNT AR TO DAY WE AR WE GOT TO
443,YEAH,YEH
444,NET,EK T
445,WASHERS WITH IT,ASHERS WITH IT
446,LIKE UM WHEN IF YOU HAVE AN EXPERIMENT LIKE THIS UM THAT UM WHEN THE UM,LAT OM WHEN S A FEW HAVE AN EXPERIMENCE LIKE THIS ON THAT LUM WHEN TH A
447,UM WELL I'VE ER I WAS JUST DOING THIS TODAY IN CLASS AND THEN UM WHILE I WAS DOING IT I I SAW THAT THAT ONLY MAGNETS CAN PICK UP UM THE WASHERS SO I THOUGHT THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHILE WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT WAS UM UM ACTING LIKE A MAGNET,AM WELL I A OURS OUR DOING THIS TOLAN CRASS AND THEN AM WHIE I WAS DOING IT I I SAW THAT THAT ONLY MAGNETS CAN'T PICK UP AM THE WASHERS SA THAT THAT THE ELECTICITY WHILE WAS FLUNG THROUGH IT WAS AM AM ACTING LIKE A MAGNET
448,R THINGS,I THINGS
449,YES,YES
450,FIRST ONE IS IS ATTACHED TO THE LIGHT BULB AND UM THE MINUS THING IS ATTACHED TO THE WIRE AND THE WIRE IS ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S UM WHEN THE ELECTRICITY GO,CASINIS IS ATTACHED TO THE LIE BOB AND ON THE MINEST THING IS ATTACHED TO THE WIRE AND THE WIRE IS ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE LIBOB AND THAT O WHEN THE ELECTRICITY TO GOS
451,UM IT UM LETS THE SOME THING THE OBJECTS,THEY ARE LET THE SOMETHING THE OBJECT
452,ING OF SCIENCE AND TO THE NEW STUFF WE'RE,ING OF SCIENCE AND TO THE NEWSLAFE
453,ONE OF THEM HAS UM THE FIRST ONE HAS ONE LIGHT BULB AND ONE BATTERY AND TWO WIRES SO O A LOT OF THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING TO GO TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IN THE SECOND ONE THERE'S TWO AND THERE'S THREE WIRES AND ONE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY SO BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS ARE DULL BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE SHARING,ONE OF THEM HAS AN THE FIRST ONE HAS ONE NIGHT POB AND ONE BATTERY AND TWO IRES SO A LOT OF THE ELECTRICITIES WEN I GOT TO LIE BOB AND IN THE SECOND ONE THERE'S TWO AND THERE'S THREE WIRES AND WANT TO LIPE OF AND ONE BATTERY SO BOTH OF THE LIGHT BOBS ARE DOLL BECAUSE THEY THEIR SHARING
454,THE BATTERY THE,THE BATTERY THE
455,THROUGH AND TURNS ON,RUTH AND TURNED ON
456,THE THEY THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SOME SOME OF THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH HAVE EITHER IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND THE ONES THAT DON'T ARE UM THE ONES THAT DON'T LIKE STICK TO MAGNETS OR DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH,THE THEY THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SOME SOME OF THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT THET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH HAVE EITHER IRON OR STEE ON THEM AND THE ONES THAT DON'T ARE UM THE ONES THAT DON'T LIKE STIC TO MAGNETS OR DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY TO GO THITTE
457,GOOD HOW ARE YOU,GET HOW ARE YOU
458,THE SWITCH AND THE O ON THE BATTERY AND IT'LL TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THEN IT'LL KEEP ON GOING UNTIL THE BATTERY GOES OUT,THE SWITCH AN THA ON THE BATTERY AND  TURN ON THE MORER AND THEN I'LL KEEP ON GOING UNTALL THE BATTERY GOES OUT
459,I THINK WHEN YOU THE THE OBJECT PUT WAS IT PUT THERE UM IT IT MADE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH,I THINK WHEN THE THE OBJECT PUT WAS THAT PET THERE A T IT MADE THE ELECTRICITY FRO THROU
460,SOME OF THE ITEMS,SOME OWTHO IREM
461,INSULATORS ARE THE ONES THAT DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SO THE UM MOTOR WON'T TURN ON,AND SO LONG AS AS THE WONE SAT DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOI THE A MORTAR WON'T TURN ON
462,UM THE FIRST ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE TWO WIRES ON THE BOTTOM OR ELSE IT WON'T THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO THROUGH IT WOULD JUST GO TO A BACK TO THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES THROUGH THE OTHER ONE AND TO THE BATTERY IT WON'T GO TO THE UM LIGHT BULB,AH THE FIRST ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE TWO WIRES ON THE BAN OR ELSE IT WONT THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO THROUGH IT WILL JUST GO TO IT BACK TO THE BATTERIGS I THE WIRES THROUGH THE OTHER ON EMTO THE BARREN IT WON'T GO TO THE A NIGHT BOX
463,THE FIRST ONE DOESN'T DIDN'T DOESN'T LIGHT THAT MUCH AND THE SECOND ONE DOESN'T LIGHT BECAUSE IT ONLY HAS ONE WIRE AND THE IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT NOT AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE THIRD BOX SAYS UH WELL IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BUT UM IT IT WILL WON'T TURN ON THAT MUCH THE FOURTH ONE WILL TURN ON BECAUSE A WIRE'S ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM AND ANOTHER ONE'S ATTACHED TO SIDE,THE FIRST ONE DOESNIT DIDN'T DOESN'T LIKE THAT MUCH AND THE SECOND ONE DOESN'T LIKE BECAUSE IT ONLY HAS ONE WAYE AND THE IT HAS TO BE A CLOSE CIRCUIN NOT AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE THIRD FOX SAYS AH WELL IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT BUT AH IT IT WILL WON'T TURN ON THAT MUCH THE FOUREST ONE WILL TURN ON BECAUSE A WIRE'S ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM AND ANOTHE ONE'S ATTACHED TO SIGHT

478,OTHER LINES A ARE THE WIRES,OTHER LINES ARE THE WIRES
479,YES,YES
480,IT'S IT'S SHOWING THINGS THAT YOU CAN MAKE ELECTRICITY WORK WITH,IT'S THE SHOWING THING IS THAT YOU CAN MAKE ELECTRICITY WORK WITH
481,TURNED ON THE MOTOR,TURNED ON THE MOTAR
482,TO GO THROUGH,O GO THROUGH
483,UM THAT'S CALLED A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND UM IT IT WILL LET THE LI ALL THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH AND IT WILL UM LET IT'LL LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB,ON THAT'S COT A CLOSE CIR GUIT AND ON IT IT WILL LET THE ALL THE ELECTRICITIO THROUL AND IT WILL ON LET ILL LIKHT THE LIP BOB
484,THE SPONGE DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S AN INSULATOR AND INSULATORS DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SO IT WOULD IT WON'T LET THE MOTOR TURN ON,THE SPON DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S AN INSULATER AND INSULATORS DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOT IT WOULD IT WOULD LET THE MOTR TURN ON
485,UH I DON'T THINK IT IS I THINK IT'S A CIRCUIT CIRCLE,AH I DON'T THINK IT IS I THINK IT'S A SOCK IT SOCKLE
486,UM IN CLASS WE HAVE AND WE'VE DONE ONE MORE THING WE HAVE THIS BLUE THING WE PUT THE BATTERY IN AND THIS RED THING THAT WOULD HOLD THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT HAD A WHOLE WIRE LIKE SET UP,OM AN CLASS WE HAVE AND WE'VE DONE ONE MORE THING WE HAD THIS BLUE THING WE PUT THE BATTERY AN AND THIS RED THING THAT WOULD HOLD THE LIGHT BALBAN THEN IT HAD A WHOLE WHILE LIKE SET UP
487,YES UM THE WIRE ON THE RIGHT MUST TOUCH THE SIDE AND THE WIRE ON THE LEFT MUST TOUCH THE BOTTOM,YES ON THE WHILE ON THE RIGHT MUST TOUCH THE SIDE AND THE RIE ON THE LEFT MUCH TOUCH THE BOTTOM
488,MMM NO NOT REALLY,NO NOT REALLY
489,WE FOUND OUT THAT ONE WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ANOTHER WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB,WE FOUND OUT THAT ONE MILE HAD TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LATE BULB IN ANOTHER WHILE HAD TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LAPLE
490,UM WE'VE BEEN GETTING A D BATTERY AND UM WE HAD TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO ATTACH THEM SOMEHOW AND GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP,AN WE'VE BEEN GETTING A D BATTERY AN UM WE HAD TWO WHILES AND WE HAD TO ATTACH THEM SOMEHOW AND GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP
491,I THINK THAT ONCE THE ELECTRICITY GOES UP THE WIRE ON THE INSIDE THE FILAMENT LIGHTS UP CAUSING IT THE THE WHOLE GLASS BULB TO SHINE,I THINK THAT ONCE ELECTRICITY GOES UP THE WITE ON THE INSIDE THE FILLINGMINT LIGHTS UP CAUSING IT THE T WHOLE GLASS BULB TO SHINE
492,I THINK THAT IS ABOUT BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT UP I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT WAY,I THINK BET US ABOUT BECAUSE IN OT A FOT TO LIGHT UP I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT WAY
493,SO IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE,SO IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE
494,I MEAN THAT UM THE CIRC THE ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRE IN THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY,I MEAN THAT UM THE SOCK THE ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIE OR IN THE LIGHT BALBING BACK INTO THE BATTERY
495,YES LIKE THAT,JUST LIKE THAT
496,IT COULD BE BUT I KNOW IT'S A SOCKET CIRCLE,COULD BE BUT I KNOW IT 'S A SOCKET SOCKALL
497,WHAT DID YOU SAY,WHAT DID YOU SAY
498,UM I'M NOT SURE,OM I'M NOT SURE
499,SURE,SUR
500,I THINK THIS IS ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND COMING BACK INTO THE BATTERY,I THINK THIS IS ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WHILE ON COMING BACK INTO THE BATTLERY
501,I THINK THERE ARE IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE RIGHT NOW,I THINK THEY WERE OUT JUST THER I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE RIGHT NOW
502,UM BECAUSE THE GLASS DOESN'T HAVE ANY WIRES ATTACHED TO IT SO IT WOULDN'T LIGHT,ALM BECAUSE THE GLASS DOESN'T HAVE ANY WILES ATTACHED TO IT SO IT WOULDN'T LIHTE
503,WE UM WE DID IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY WE TOOK TWO WIRES ATTACHED ONE TO THE NEGATIVE ONE TO THE POSITIVE AND THEN WE HAD THE LIGHT BULB AND WE PUT THE TWO SIDE ONE SIDE FROM EACH UM ONE SIDE FROM EACH WIRE AND ATTA UM TACH THE LIGHT BULB AND IT LIT UP,WE UM WE DID IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY WE TOOK TWO WILES ATTACHED ONE TO THE NEGATIVE ONE TO THE POSITIVE AND THEN WE HAD THE LIGHT BULB AND WE PUT THE TWO SIHE ONE SIDE FROM EACH UM ONE SIDE FROM EACH WILE AND ATATUM TOUCHED THE LIGHT BULB AND IT LIT UP
504,YES,LOST
505,UM A CIRCUIT WELL I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT A CIRCUIT CIRCLE IS THE LIGHT BULB AND THE WIRE AND IT RUNS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND KEEPS ON GOING IN A CIRCLE,U I SOCKIT WELL I'M NOT EXACTLY SHAW BUT A SOKIT CORKLE IS THE LIGHT BULB AN THE WILE AND IT RUNS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND KEEPS OGOING IN A SOCKLE
506,UM THAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE TAKES ELECTRICITY IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE AND FROM THE PICTURE IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH THIS M METAL THING IN THE LIGHT BULB AND CAUSES IT TO LIGHT UP,ONTHAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE TAKES ELECTRICITY IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WILE AND FROM THE PICTURE IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH THIS MEDL THING ON THE LIGHT BULP AND CAUSES IT TO LIGHT UP
507,UM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE WIRES TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB OTHERWISE IT WON'T LIGHT AND THEREFORE NO LIGHT,AM I THINK IT'S AN POTI FOR THE WHILE SHE TOUCHED THE LIGHT BALB OTHERWISE IT WON'T LIGHT AND THER'LL FALL NO LIGHT
508,UM THE ONE WITH THE MINUS SIDE IS CALLED THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE ONE WITH THE PLUS SIGN IS CALLED THE POSITIVE SIDE,AM THE ONE WITH THE MIND ISIDE IS CALLED THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE ONE WITH THE PLUIN IZ CALLED THE POSITIVE SIDE
509,YES EXCEPT THE BLUE THING WASN'T AS BIG,YES EXCEPT THE BLUE THING WASN'T AS BIG
510,NO BECAUSE IT THE LOOKS LIKE THAT IT THE METAL ON THE INSIDE MUST BE TOUCH TOUCHING THIS OTHER TYPE OF METAL,NO BECAUSE IT AT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT THOUGH METAL ON THE INSIDE MUST BE TOUCHED TOUCHING THI OTHER TYPE OF METAL
511,I THINK IT MIGHT,I THINK IT MY
512,YES I THINK SO,YES I THINK SO
513,I THINK THERE MIGHT BE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE,I THINKTHE'LL MIGHT BE I'M NOT EXACTLY SU
514,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND DOWN TO THE OTHER WIRE,AM IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PHILIMENT AND DOWN TO THE OTHER WHILE
515,NO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD,NO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
516,NO BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND BACK IN THE BATTERY,NOW BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE WHILE AND BACK IN THE BATTLY
517,YES BECAUSE SOME ELECTRICITY IS BEING USED BY THE LIGHT BULB,YES BECAUSE SOMEONE LOOCTRUCITHE IS BEING USED BY THE LIGHT BALL
518,WE FOUND OUT THAT UM UM ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE PO UH UM FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,HE FOUND OUT THAT ALM OM ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE POT ON FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THREW THE LIGHT BOLPEN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
519,THINK I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE IF THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE WIRE ON THE INSIDE IT WON'T LIGHT,HING I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WHILE IF THE WHILE ISN'T TOUCHING THE WHIE ON THE INSIDE IT WON'T LIGHT
520,NO BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED THE UNIT TODAY,NOW BECAUSE HE JUST STOL T HE BEING IN TE TO DAY
521,JUST A LITTLE BIT,JUST THE LILEFIN
522,UM WE FOUND THAT MAGNETS STICK TO IRON AND NOT TO BRASS AND THEY STICK TO STEEL,WE FOUND THAT MAGNICK STICK TOO A ON AND YE NIGHT TO WORK TAST ANBE STITCHE STEAL
523,WE HAVE BEEN UM SEEING WHICH KINDS OF METAL STICK TO MAGNETS,WE HAVE SENT ON SEEING ON WHICH KINDS OF MEDAL STICK TO MANES
524,WHAT DO I DO NOW,D N
525,YES,YES
526,YES,YES

565,YES WE HAVE DONE DRAWING LIKE THAT EXCEPT WITH A MOTOR,YES WE HAVE DONE DRAWING LIKE THAT CEPT WITH A MOTOR
566,UM SAY THAT THE SWITCH WAS UP THAT MEANS IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO COMPLETELY THROUGH SO IF YOU HAD IT DOWN IT WOULD GO COMPLETELY THROUGH BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY AND KEEP ON GOING IN A CIRCLE,UM SAY THAT THE SWITCH WAS UP THAT MEANS IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO COMPLETELY THROUGH SO IF YOU HAD DOWN IT WOULD GO COMPLETELY THROUGH BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY AND KEEP ON GOING IN A SOCKLE
567,UM I THIN THINK YOU WOULD JUST PUT TWO DOTS AND A LINE GOING THROUGH IT,AH MY THINK YOU WOULD JUST PUT TWO DOTS IN THE LINE GOING THROUGH IT
568,THE MOTOR WOULD NOT BE CONNECTED BECAUSE OF THE SWITCH IS UP SO THE MOTOR WON'T BE WORKING,IF THE MOTOR WOULD NOT BE CONNECTED BECAUSE OF THE SWITCHES UP SO THE MOTOR WON'T BE WALKING
569,UM UH MMM WELL THE MOTOR LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE UM CIRCUIT,AMA WELL THE MODOR LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN THE PELE OF THE HUMSOCKET
570,UM A COMPLETE CIRCUIT WOULD BE THE BATTERY HOOKED UP TO LIKE A SAY A LIGHT BULB AND THEN COMING BACK TO THE BATTERY AND GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE,A COMPLETE SOCKIT WOULD BE THE BATTERY HOOKED UP TO LIKE A SHA LIHT BALB AND THEN COMING BACK TO THE BATTERYING GOING AROUND IN ER SOCKLE
571,UM THERE'S A SWITCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCUIT SO IF THE ME IF THE METAL IF THE METAL POLE'S TOUCHING THE M METAL IT IF THE METAL POLE'S TOUCHING THE METAL IT'LL GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND TURN ON THE MOTOR BUT IF IT'S PULLED AWAY LIKE IT IS IN THE PICTURE IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THE MOTOR WILL STOP,OM TALS A SWITCH IN THE METLE OF THE SOCKET SO IF THE MAT THE METAL IF THE METAL POLES TOUCHING THEM METAL IT IF THE METALPOLES TOUCHING THE METAL IT'LL GO THROUGH THE WILE TOR NON THE MOTLE BUT IF IT'S PULLED AWAY LIKE IT IS IN THE PICJO IT WON'T GO THROUGH IN THE MOTLE WELL STOP
572,A CIRCUIT IS THE ELEC THE ELECTRICITY HOW IT FLOWS,A SOCKET IS THE ELECT THE ELECTRICITY HOW IT FLOWS
573,UH YES WE DID ONE LIKE THIS EXCEPT IT ALSO HAD A SWITCH,AH YES WE DID ONE LIKE THIS ECEPTOR ALSO HAD A SWITCH
574,UM SO THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A CIRCLE AND WHATEVER OBJECT IS THAT IS HOOKED UP TO THE BATTERY OR ELECTRIC SOURCE UM IS A ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE,AM SO THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A SOCKALL AND WHATEVER OBJECT IT IS THAT IS HOOKED UP TO THE BATTERY O ELECTRIC SAUCE AN IS ELECTRICITY WE SEE WO IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING AROUND AND SOCK
575,UM NO,M YOU KNOW
576,UM THIS CIRCUIT IS IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH INTO THE MOTOR BACK AROUND BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND KEEPS ON GOING AND EVENTUALLY THE BATTERY WILL BATTERY WILL RU RUN OUT,AM THIS SOCKET IS IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THREW INTO THE MOTOR BACK ROUND BACK TO THE BED ROOM AND KEEPS ON GOING AND EVENTUALLY THE BATTER WILL BATTLERY WILL WANT RUN OUT
577,YOU WOULD PUT TWO DOTS AND THEN A LINE WITH A DOT AND YOU WOULD ADD A SW IF YOU ADDED A SWITCH IT WOULD UM MAKE THE THING SPIN AROUND AND THE BATTERY WOULD BE GIVING OUT ENERGY,YOU WOULD PUT TO DOTS AND THEN A LINE WITH A DOT AND YOU WOULD ADD A SIF YOU ADDED A SWHICH IT WOULD UM MAKE THE THING SPIN ROUND AND THE BATTERY WOULD BE GIVING OUT ENARGY
578,A SWITCH I WILL TURN ON A CIRCUIT OR TURN IT OFF,A SWITCH IS WELL TURN ON A SOCKET OR TON IT OFF
579,GOOD,A
580,YES WE JUST DID A WORKSHEET ON IT,YES WE JUST STILL  WALK SHEET ON IT
581,UM SO ONE WIRE'S ATTACHED TO ONE END OF THE CIRCUIT AND THE OTHER'S ATTACHED TO ONE END I MEAN ONE END OF THE SWITCH ONE AND THE OTHER'S ATTACHED TO ONE END OF THE SWITCH AND ONE END TO THE LIGHT BULB SO IF YOU UNATTA ATTACH UM I MEAN IF YOU OPEN THE SWITCH THE LIGHT BULB WILL STOP BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT ISN'T THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T GOING COMPLETELY THROUGH,OM SO ONE WHILE IS ATTACHED TO ONE END OF THE SOCKET AND THE OTHERS ATTACHED TO ONE AND I MEAN ONE END OF THE SWITCH ON AND THE OTHERS ATTACHED TO ONE END OF THE SWITCH AND ONE END TO THE LIGHT BALBSO IF YOU UN I TYOU TACH OM I MEAN IF YOU OPEN THE SWITCH THE LIGHT BALL BLE STOPPED BECAUSE THE SOCKET ISN' THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T GOING COMPLETELY SLEEP
582,YOU CAN UNPLUG ONE WIRE FROM THE BATTERY,YOU CAN UNPLUG ONE WHILE FROM THE BARREY
583,UM YOU CAN PULL THE SWITCH AWAY FROM THE OTHER PIECE OF METAL AND IT'LL STOP,AM YOU CAN PULL THE SWITCH AWAY FROM THE OTHER PIECE OF METAL AND NO STOP
584,YES,YS
585,UH YES WE HAVE,AH YES WE HAVE
586,UM WE ARE UH DOING STUFF WITH CIRCUITS LIKE WE HAVE TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT AND A MOTOR WORK,OM WE ARE DOING STUFF WITH SALK GITS LIKE WE HAVE TO MAKE A LIGHPE BULB LIHT IN A MODOL WALK
587,UM THAT THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW COMPLETELY THROUGH IN ORDER TO IN ORDER FOR THE UM ENERGY RECEIVER TO UM WORK,UM THAT THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW COMPLETELY THROUGH IN ORDLE TO IN ORDER FOR THE U ANALDRI WE SEE WAR TO UM WALK
588,THE CIRCUIT WILL STOP WORKING AND THE LIGHT BULB WON'T LIGHT UP,THE SOCKET WILL STOP WALKING IN THE LIGHT BALL WON'T LIGHT UP
589,I DON'T KNOW YOU TELL ME,I DUN'T KNOW YOU TELL ME
590,MAYBE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH,MAYBE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH
591,THE LIGHT IS GOING TOWARD THE D CELL AND OUT OF THE END OF IT AND THE ELECTRICITY SENDS THROUGH AND ONTO THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM IT,THE LIGHT IS GOING TOWARDS THE DECAIL AND OUT THE END OF IT AND THE ELECTRICITY SCENDS THROUGH AND ON TO THE LIFELE FROM THE DECEIL AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM IT
592,THE BATTERIES HELP THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND ONTO THE LIGHT BULB,THE BATTERIES FELT THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND ONTO THE LIPEBULB
593,THE STUFF THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WIRES IS ELECTRICITY THE WAS HOOKED TO THE TO THE D CELL AND WENT THROUGH THE WIRE AND ONTO THE LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT PROTECTS THE,THE STUFF THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WRIERS IS ELECTRICITY THAT WAS PUT TO THE TO THE DESAIL AND WENT THROUGH THE WIRE AND ON TO E LIFE AB THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT PROTECTSTYAYA
594,WELL WHAT I SEE IS I SEE THESE BLUE LITTLE DOTS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB HAS TWO DOTS THAT ARE SURROUNDING THE WIRES THAT ARE IN IT,BUT WHAT I SEE IS I SEE THESE BLUE LITTLE DOTS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE WIEFALB AND THE WIEFOB HAS TWO DOTS AT IS SURROUNDING THE WIRES ATTER IN IT
595,WHAT I NOTICE IS THAT EVERY TIME I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT TURNS THE OPPOSITE WAY OF WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE,WHAT I NOTICE IS THAT EVERY TIME I CUOCK ON THE DECAIL IT CURRENCE THE OPPOSITE WAY OF WHAT IT SUPPOSED TO BE
596,LEFT,ANT
597,HOW ARE YOU DOING,HOW ARE YOU DOING
598,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
599,THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH FLOWING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH ORFLOWING BECAUSE I DON' KNOW
600,IT WOULDN'T I DON'T THINK IT WOULD PRODUCE LIGHT,IT WOULDN' I DON'T THINK IT WOULD PRODUCE LIGHT
601,A LITTLE BLUE AROUND CIRCLE SURROUNDS THE ENDINGS OF THE WIRE,A LITTLE BLUE GROUND CIRCLE SURROUND TANDINGS OF THE WYRE
602,I NOTICE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY WHICH YOU JUST TOLD AND THEN I CAN SEE THEM GOING THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND OUT THE OTHER AND IT'S OBSERVING THE LIGHT AND MAKING THE LIGHT SHINE ON THE LIGHT BULB,I NOTICE THE LITTLE FLUE DATS IT ARE THE ELECTRICITY WHICH YOU JUST TOLD ME AND THAT I CAN SEE THEM GOING THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE DESAIL AND OFF THE OTHER AND ITS OBSERVING MELIGHT IN MAKING THE LIGHT SHINE ON THE LIFALL
603,IT IT IS VERY COOL AND I AND I CAN SEE IT'S GOOD HOW YOU EXPLAINED HOW THE LITTLE THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRICITY AND IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT TAKES OUT ALL THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL AND BRINGS IT OUT THE OTHER THE OTHER END OF IT AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY IN THE LIGHT AND MAKES THE LIGHT SHINE,IIS SAID OF VERY COLD AND AND I CAN SEE IT'S GOOD HOW YOU EXPLAINED HOW THE LITTLE THE BLUE DOTH IS ELECTRICITY AND ITS FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT TAKES OUT ALL THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE DESAIL AND BRINGS IT OUT THE OTHERS THE OTHER END OF IT AND PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY IN THE LIGHT AND MAKES THE LIGHT SHINE
604,ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE BUT THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL SO THE D CELL HAS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT PUTS IT THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND SHINES ITS LIGHT,ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE BUT THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THE DESOILS OF THE DESAIL HAS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT PUTS IT THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE WIPEUB AND SHINES ITS LIFE

691,WHAT,WH
692,BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO WITH JUST ONE ENERGY CELL,BOTH LIFE BOGS ARE LIGHTING UP MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO JUST ONE DESAIL
693,ONLY ONE OF THEM WILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY,ONLY ONE OF THEM WILL LIT OUT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A OF ELECTRICITY
694,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM,WEVE BEEN TER MERE ABOUT ELECTROL MAGNETISM
695,THERE'S TWO REASONS BECAUSE NEGATIVE CAN'T THE NEGATIVE SIDE CAN'T GO THROUGH AND THEN COME OUT COME INTO NEGATIVE SIDE AGAIN AND ALSO THE TWO THERE'S TWO THERE'S THE TWO D CELLS ARE HOOKED ONTO EACH OTHER FROM BOTH SIDES,BE THERE'S TWO REASONS BECAUSE NEGATIVE CAN'T THE NEGATIVES I CAN'T GO THROUGH AND THEN COME OUT COME INTO NEGATIVE AGAIN AND ALSO THE TWO THERE'S TWO COTHERE'S THE TWO DETAILS ARE HOOKED ON TO EACH OTHER FROM BOTH SI
696,I THINK BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP BETTER BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY,I THINK BOTH OF THE LIPEMOBS ILL LIGHT A BETTER BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY
697,THEY'RE BOTH LIT UP BUT THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE NOT REALLY THEY'RE NOT LIGHT HOW AS LIGHT AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THEY'RE REALLY REALLY DIM,THEY'RE BOTH LIT UP BUT THEY'RE DIM THEY ARE NOT REALLY THEY ARE NOT LIGHT HOW AS LIGHT AS THE SUR SUPPOSED TO BE THE REALLY REALLY DAM
698,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
699,EVERY TIME I CLICK ON IT IT CHANGED THE ONE SIDE OF A D CELL AND TURNED IT THE RIGHT WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO SUPPOSED TO BE AND WHEN YOU TURN IT THAT WAY THERE'S ELECTROMAGNETISM COMING THROUGH ONE SIDE AND THEN GOING OUT THE OTHER SO IT MAKES MORE ELECTRICITY AND WHEN YOU MAKE MORE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP,EVERY TIME I CLICK ON IT IT CHANGED ONE SIDE OF A DE SO AND TURNED TE RIGHT WAY IT SUPPOSED TO I SUPPOSED TO BE AND WHEN YOU TURN IT THAT WAY THOSE LOOKIN ATIT MAGNETISM COMING THROUGH ONE SIDE AND THEN GOING OUT THE OTHER SO IT MAKES MORE ELECTRICITY IN LAKE MORE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BALLS LIGHT UP
700,EACH SIDE OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE AND THE AND THE POSITIVE AND ON THE BOTTOM IT HAS TO TOUCH THE CORE OF IT AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB,EACH SIDE OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHEDING THE NEGATIVE ON THE POT AND THE POSITIVE AND ON THE BOTTOM IT HAS TO TOUCH H FOR OF IT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIPALL
701,WELL WE DID A PROJECT OF THIS THE OTHER DAY AND WE HAD A QUESTION ON OUR WORD WALL WHAT IF WE HAD TWO LIGHT BULBS COULD WE MAKE BOTH OF THEM LIGHT UP WITH THE CIRCUIT AND SOME PEOPLE SAID YES AND SOME PEOPLE SAID NO BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY DID IT ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB LIT UP BECAUSE THAT IT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH D CELL ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH AND ON TO THE BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS,WELL WE DID A PROJECT OF THIS THAT OTHER DAY AND WHEN WE DID IT WE WE HAD A QUESTION ON OUR WORD WALL WHAT IF WE HAD TWO LIE BULBS COULD WE MAKE BOTH OF EM LIGHT UP WITH THE CIRCUIT AND SOME PEOPLE SAID THEES AF SOME PEOPLE SAID NO BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY DID IT ONLY ONE LIGHT BALB LIT UP BECAUSE THAT IF THERE WASN'T A ANUP AM DESAL ELECTRICITY JO FLOW THROUGH AND ON TO THE BOTH OF THE LIFEMOST
702,THERE HAS TO BE FULL COMPONENTS TO DO A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,THERE HAS TO BE FU COMPONENTS TO DEAL A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
703,IF YOU TURN ONE D CELL AROUND AND A NEGATIVE WOULD FACE ONE DIRECTION AND THE AND THE OTHER AND THE PLUS SIGN WOULD FACE THE OTHER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TWO TWO COMPONENTS FACING THE SAME DIRECTION THEN THE TWO D CELL COMPONENTS WILL NOT THERE WON'T BE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BATTERIES IN THEM AND IN THE BACK,IF YOU TURN PLENTY CELLA ROUND IN A NEGATIVE WOULD FACE ONE DIRECTION IN THE IN THE OTHER IN AND THE IN THE PLESINE WOULD FACE THE OTHER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO TWO COMPONENTS FACING THE SAME DIRECTION THEN THE TWO DSEIL COMPONENTS WILL NOT THERE WON'T BE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BATTERIES IN THEM IN THE BA
704,A CIRCUIT IS ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM,A CIRCUIT IS ABOWED ELECTREMAGNETISM
705,WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH WIRES AND D CELL AND ALSO A SWITCH AND A LIGHT BULB,WHILE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH TWIRES AND THAT DESAIL AND ALSO A SWITCH AND A LIPOFF
706,POSITIVE CAN'T GO IN IT,POSITIVE CAN'T GO IS IT LECTRI
707,THEY'RE ALL AN ENERGY SOURCE,THERE ALL AN ENERDY SORCE
708,THEY'RE ALL TOUCHING EACH SIDE OF THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES LIKE ON THE BATTERY IT HAS THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDES AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH IT CAN'T IF YOU USE THE BATTERIES IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COME OUT AND COME OUT OF THE NEGATIVE,THEY ARE ALL TOUCHING EIGHT SIDE OF THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES LIKE ON THE BATTERY IT HAS THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDES AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH IT CAN'T EBE YIELD TO BATTERIES IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND CME OUT AND COME OUT OF THE NEGATIVE

767,TRYING THEY'RE TRYING TO WEIGH THAT UM BIG BALL AND THEY'RE USING GRAM PIECES TO TRY TO MEASURE IT AND THE BIG BALLS WAY BIGGER THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHEN WE DID IT,RYING THEY'RE TRYIN THE WAY THAT ON BIG BALL IN THEIR USING GRANDPIECES TO TRY A MEASURE AND THE BIG BALL IS WAY BIGGER THAT'S COMN WHAT I LOOK LIKE WHEN WE DID IT
768,AS LONG AS YOU KNOW LIKE HOW MANY LIKE GRAMS OR UM HOW BIG IT IS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW MANY LIKE GRAHMSER AHMHOW BIG IT IS ARE SO LIKE TAT
769,AS FAR AS I SEE NO NOT REALLY,AS FAR AS I SEE NONA REALLY
770,THIS LOOKS PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY WA LIKE WHAT WE'RE USING CAUSE OF THE TWENTIES EXCEPT FOR THEY WERE BROWN AND THE REDS WERE EXACTLY THE SAME AND THE EVERYTHING ELSE WAS THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE TWENTY AND THE TWENTY WAS BROWN AND WE ALSO USED THE CUPS SO,THIS LOOKS PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY LIKE WHAT WE ARE USING CAUSE OF THE TWENTIES EXCEPT WHERE THEY WERE BROWN AND THE REDS WERE EXACTLY THE SAME IN THE EVERYTHING ELSE WAS THE SAME EXCEPBER THE TWENTY AND THE TWENTY WAS BROWN AND WE ALSO USED THE CUPS SO
771,WHICH,WHICH
772,WE HAD GRAM PIECES THAT WERE WORTH LIKE FIVE TEN TWENTY AND ONE GRAMS AND ALSO BEFORE WE HAD MEASURED A MARBLE AND THAT WAS SIX SO WE ALSO USED THE MARBLE AND ALL THE GRAM THINGS TO MEASURE HOW MUCH GRAMS IT WAS,WE HAD GRAM PIECES THAT WERE WORTH LIKE FIVE TEN TWENTY AND ONE GRAMS AND ALSO BEFORE WE HAD MEASURED A MARBLE AND THAT WAS SIX SO WE ALSO USED THE MARBLE AND ALL THE GRAM THINKS THE MEASUREN HOW MUCH GRAHMSIR WAS

774,WE LEARNED ABOUT WA WELL WE MEASURED A A BUNCH OF GRAVEL AND AN APPLE AND LIKE WE WERE LEARNING HOW MANY LIKE GRAMS THEY EACH WERE,WE LEARNED EBOUT BUT WHAT WE MEASURED A A BUNCH OF GRAVLE AN AN APPLE AND  WE WERE LEARNING HOW MANY LIKE GRAHAMS THEY EACH WERE
775,ONE THOUSAND,ONE THOUSAND
776,YES,YES
777,GOOD,GOOD
778,WHAT WE DID IS UM FIRST WE MEASURED PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEN UM WE MEASURED THIS WE AND THEN WE MEASURED THE APPLE TO THE PART OF PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEY WERE THE EXACT SAME SO WE KNEW THAT IT HAD TO BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN GRAMS AND THEN WE JUST WHICH UM HELPED US FIGURE OUT THE THE PROBLEM,WHAT WE DID IS OM FIRST WE MEASURED PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEN M WE MEASURED THIS WHO AND THEN WE MEASURED THE APPLE TO THE PART PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEY WERE THE EXACT SAME SO WE KNEW THAT IT HAD TO BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN GRANDS AND THEN WE WHICH OM HELPED US FIGURE OUT THE THE PROBLEM
779,ACTUALLY WE MEASURED THE GRAVEL THEN THE APPLE WE MEASURED PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEN WE MEASURE AND THEN WE PUT PART OF THE GRAVEL WITH THE AP APPLE AND THEN THEY WERE EQUAL SO WE KNOW HOW MUCH THE APPLE WAS,ACTUALLY WE MEASURED THE GRAVEL THEN THE APPLE WE MEASURED PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEN WE MEASURED AND NOW WE PUT PART OF THE GRAVEL WITH THE APAPPLE AND THEN THEY WERE EQUAL SO WE KNEW HOW MUCH THE APPLE WAS
780,NO,NO
781,YES A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN GRAMS,YES A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN GRAMS
782,THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE WHAT OUR GRAM PIECES LOOK LIKE AND IT'S KINDA SHOWING GRAMS AND JUST LIKE SHOWING LIKE SOME ABBREVIATIONS FOR GRAMS AND KIL KILOGRAMS AND GR AND LIKE HOW MANY GRAMS GO INTO ONE KILOGRAM,THAT KIND O LOAKS LIKE WOUR GRANDPIECES LOOK LIKEIN ITS KIND OF SHOWING GRAHMS AND JUST LIKE SHOWING LIKE SOME ABBREVIATIONS FOR GRAMS AN KIL KILOGRAMS AND RECIN LIKE HOW MANY GRAMS GOIN TO ONE KELEGRAM
783,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME
784,YOU WOULD PICK UP THE BALL AND PUT IT IN ONE OF THE CUPS AND THEN YOU WOULD PUT THE GRAMS PIECES IN LIKE ALL LIKE YOU START WITH LIKE PUTTING LIKE A CO LIKE A COUPLE OF FIVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE YOU JUST KEEP PUTTING MORE AND MORE IN UNTIL IT'S LIKE ALMOST EQUAL INTO THE EQUALEST YOU CAN GET IT,YOU WOULD PICK UP THE BALL AND PUT IT IN ONE OF THE CUPS AND THEN YOU WOULD PUT THAT GRAND PIECES IN LIKE ALL LIKE YOU START H LIKE PUTTING LIKE LIKE A COUPLE OF FIVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE YOU JUST KEEP PUTTING MORE AND MORE IN UNTIL IT'S LIKE ALMOST EQUAL NTI THE EQUALEST YOU CAN GET IT

1248,THERE'S UM SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THEN A WASHER'S GOING INTO THE UM UM THE CUP,THERE IS A SPACES BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE WASH IS GOING INTO THE UM AM THE CAT
1249,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER
1250,THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE UM THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AREN'T AS UM STRONG,THO MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE ON THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNUTS ARN IS UN STRONG
1251,UM WELL WHEN Y WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GONNA PU IT'S GONNA PROBABLY BREAK MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNET,UM WELL WHEN Y WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GOIN UP IT'S GOIN TO PROBABLY BREAK MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS AND BETWEEN THE MAGNET
1252,WHEN THERE'S SPACE BETWEEN UM THE MAGNETS UM THE FORCE ISN'T AS STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASILY,WHEN THERE'S SPACE BETWEEN EM THE MAGNETS UM THE FORCE ISN'T AS STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASILY
1253,THERE'S A BIGGER UM LIKE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM WHEN THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,HERE'S A BIGGER OM LIKE SPACE BETWEEN EM WHEN THE'RE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
1254,N GROUP A B AND D UM THE WASHERS ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND IN GROUP C THEY'RE JUST KINDA SCATTERED AROUND THE CUP,IN GROUP A B AND D ON THE WASHERS ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND IN GROUP S THEY ARE JUST KINA SCATTERED AROUND THE CUP
1255,WELL IN GROUP C THERE'S ONLY FI IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WASHERS WITH N ZERO SPACERS AND IN A B AND D IT ALL THEY TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS,WELL IN GROUP SEA THERE IS ONLY FIVE IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WASHERS WITH ZERIL SPACERS AND IN A B AN D IT ALL THEY TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS
1256,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS IN THERE TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS IN THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRIED TO BREAK THE FORCE AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPACER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAK THE FORCE,USE THE BALANCE AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS AND THERE TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS AN THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRIED TO BREAK THE FORST AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPACEER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAK THE FORCE
1257,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES,I NOTICE THAT THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES
1258,BYE SEE YOU TOMORROW,BY SEE YOU TO MORROW
1259,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER UM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT IS A UM THAT THE SPACER IS IN BETWEEN,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER AN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT THE AM THAT THE SPACER IS IN BETWEEN
1260,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM MAGNETS AND THEY SEEING HOW HOW F UM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OM MAGNETS AND THEY SEEING HOW HALF OM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FOREST BREAKS
1261,UM IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK,M IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK
1262,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BR HOW MANY WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FOREST HOW MANY WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORST BREAKS
1263,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS ARE THE FORCE IS LEA IT'S UM WEAKENING,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS ARE THE FORCES ITS U WEAKENING
1264,UM THE MORE WASHERS THAT YOU ADD THE EASIER OR WHEN THE THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE LE IT'S NOT AS STRONG SO THEY BREAK APART,N THE MORE WASHERS THA YOU AD THE EASIER ARE WHEN THA THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE LET ITS NOT IS STRONG SO THEY BREAK APART
1265,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE UM ER AND THEN WE WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG IT HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BROKE,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE UM AND THEN WE WEUSED A BALANCE AN THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG IT HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFORE THE FOREST BROKE
1266,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1267,IT'S LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM AND IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LON HOW THE FORCE HOW MU HOW BY TOGETHER THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE FOR THERE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE,LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETES WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEEN EM AND IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LONG HOW THE FORT HOW HW CLOSE TOGETHER THE MAGNETES NEED TO BE FOR THERE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE
1268,WE USE THE BALANCE AND WE PUT LIKE SPACE UH WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONE SIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS IN IT AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AH AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPACERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK BEFORE THE B FORCE BROKE,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT LIKE SPACE OF WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONE SIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS ON IT AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS A AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPACERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK BEFORE THE FORCE BROKE
1269,WELL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STICK THEY JUST LIKE PUSHED APART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALMOST NO WAY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PUT 'EM TOGETHER THEY'D GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UM SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORCE THERE,UT WHEN THEY DIDN'T WANT A STICK THEY JUST LIKE PUSHED APART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALMOST NO WAY TO PUSH EM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PUT EM TOGETHER THEY'D GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UM EOTHER SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORST THERE
1270,E REASON ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO G GET THAT IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TOO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE MA THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK,REASON ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER THERE AND ON THE FORCES IT STRONG ENOUGH TO GET THAT IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T COME IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MATNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TOO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OUT THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK
1271,MARNIE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER,MARNE ANT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO I'LL TALK TO LATER
1272,GOODBYE MARNIE,GOOD BYE MARNIE
1273,UM THERE IS A LIKE A THERE'S LIKE UH THEY COULD LIKE STICK THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT COULD PULL 'EM TOGETHER AND THERE'S A FORCE THAT COULD PUSH 'EM APART,THERE IS A LIKE A THERE'S LIKE A THEY COULD LIKE STICK THROUGH BECAUSE THERE'S A FOREST THERE THAT COULD PULL EM TOGETHER AND THERE'S A FORSE THAT COULD PUSH EM APART
1274,OH THE ELEC UM THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CLIP MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET,OH THE ALERKAM THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE AM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CLIPE MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET
1275,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1276,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IS IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP STAYS AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM,WHILE THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM I THE IS IN THEAM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP IN THE PAPER CLIP STATES AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM
1277,UM WE'VE BEEN UH LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS,UM WE'VE BEEN A LEARNING HOUN'SE MAGNETS KIN N CHAIN UP AND A  SOMEWHAT O IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1278,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THERE IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART,SOMEAR TURN TO THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME RETURN TO THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THEY IS A FORESTER THAT PUSHES THEM APART
1279,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UH USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT 'EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE A USED FOR LOT OF THINGS AND A YOU COULD LIKE PUDDUMS AH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE A MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK
1280,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,I THINK THAT THE A THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROSS TO THE AM ITS SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SENSE THE MAGNETISM IS STILL IN THERE IT N MAKES THE MADNEXT IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE MAL STICK TO THE PAPER QITNAL
1281,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1282,WELL W WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN 'EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN 'EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT THE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WOR THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE,WELL WHIN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY TRACKED THEY IF YOU TURN EM OVER THEN HEY'LL PUSH A PART BUT IF YOU TURN EM THE OTHER WAY AND THEYR RIGHT IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WERT THEN M THEN IT WILL WORK THAT THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE IS A FORCE THERE
1283,WELL THEY'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT 'EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO LI IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO,WILL THERE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE COULD BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT ON STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO BUT IT WON'T DO ON WHAT YOU WANT IT TO
1284,AGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL,HIS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND ITS SENDING THE MAGNETISM THREUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO ITS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL
1285,THERE'S A FORCE THAT PU THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS 'EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER,ERE'S A FORST THEREIS THAT THERE'S A FORST THERE THAT PULLS THEM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE A TRACK TOGETHER IF SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULDN MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER
1286,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET MEANS IT'LL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,UM IT'S BECAUSE AH TO DAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT ITS BEBECAUSE THEY THE UM THE DOLE MAL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET  MEANS THAT IT WILL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES
1287,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOME THICK THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOME THING'S IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CANOM LIKE SOMETHING THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOMETHINGS IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE
1288,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETI THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND IT'LL STAY ON THE NAIL,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETIC THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT IN A LITTLE STAY ON THE NAIL
1289,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT N IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT IT'S ON IT AND THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET,OH WHUELDN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MENTMEN ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER ECLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO A THE SINCE IT ISN'N ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT IT'S NOT A PERMANET A MAGNET IT'S THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT MAGNET IT'S ON IT AND THEN THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET
1290,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
1291,UM WELL THE THICKNESS IF WE IF IT'S TOO THICK AND THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE IRON OR STEEL THEN UM IT'LL,IF IT'S NOT US STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T WORK AND IT WON'T GO THROUGH THE THICKNESS BUT IF IT'S THICK ENOUGH IF IT'S NOT TOO THICK THEN IT WILL GO A THEN IT WILL GO RIGHT IT'LL GO THE RIGHT WAY AND IT WILL KEEP DOING
1292,THE LONG SILVER OBJECT IS UM IT'S CALLED A DULL NAIL AND UM AND THERE'S A UM THERE'S A LIKE A MAG THE MAGNET IS LIKE SENDING MAGNETISM THROUGH THE DULL NAIL AND IT'S GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP IT'S GOING TO THE PERRY CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING TO IT IT'S ATTRACTING THIS PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NAIL INSTEAD OF IT HAVING TO STICK EXACTLY TO THE MAGNET,BELONG SILVER OBJECTS IS ANITS CALEDULE MALE AND UM AND THERE'S A UM THERE'S A LIKE A MAGTHE MAGNET IS LIKE SENDING MANETISM THROUGH THE DULL MAIL AND IT'S GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP IT'S GOING TO THE PERECLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING TO IT IT'S ATTRACTING THIS PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE MAIL INSTEAD OF IT HAVING THE STICK EX
1293,GOODBYE MARNIE I NEED TO TALK I CAN TA,OOD BY MY NE I MEAN TO TALK O HIM
1294,WELL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT'LL BE THE LIGHT BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER,WELL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT'LL BE THE LIGHT BUBBLL BE BRIGHTER
1295,WELL THE WHOLE FLOW STOPS,WOOL THE WHOLE FLOE STOPS
1296,IF ONE BULB BURMS OUT THEN THEY BOTH THE UM THE OTHER BU THE OTHER BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THE OTHER KIND OF CIRCUIT THEN THEY THEY'D BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH THE SAME UM ENER THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IF ONE BULL BURNS OUT THEN THEY BOTH THE UM THE OTHER BUT THE OTHER BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THE OTHER KIND OF CIRCUIT THAN THEY'D BOTH BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH THE SAME UM AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT O ENERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY
1297,WELL WELL IT ALL STOPS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE MMM BECAUSE Y ONE DIES OUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT SO IF YOU CLICK ON IT THEN THAT MEANS BOTH OF THEM WILL DIE OUT BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THE THE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE SECOND ONE IT'LL KEEP GOING SO UH BECAUSE IT'S DEAD AND IT CAN GO THROUGH THE SECOND ONE,ELL WELL IT ALL STOPS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE BECAUSE UONE DIES OUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT SO IF YOU CLICK ON IT TEN THOT MEANS BOTH OF EM WILL DIE OUT BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THAT THE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE SECOND ONE IT'LL KEEP GOING SO U BECAUSE IT'S DEAD AND IT CAN GO THROUGH THE CO
1298,WELL YOU COULD REALLY USE BOTH OF 'EM BUT IF YOU USE UM A SERIES CIRCUIT THEN UM THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GONNA BE MORE DIM BUT IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE AS DIM,UT YOU COULD REALLY USE BOTH OF EM BUT F YOU USE ON A SERIS CIRCUIT THEN UH THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GOING TO BE MORE DIM BUT IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE ASDIM
1299,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS,ELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERY CIRCUIT
1300,WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE THEY DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST UM UP AND THROUGH SO YEAH,WELL THERE'S ONLY WANT THERE THERE DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST IM UP AND THROUGH SO YE
1301,WELL WHEN YOU BURN OUT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOSTLY THEY BOTH GO OFF,O WHEN YOU BURN NOT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOSTLY THEY BOTH GO OFF
1302,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THEN IT WON'T WORK VERY GOOD,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUA HAS TWO AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THE WON'T WORK VERY GOOD
1303,WELL IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR UM A CIR A LONG STRING A LIGHTS IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE AS UH UH THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS BRIGHT,ELL IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR ON A CIRLONG STRING OLIGHTS IT'S PROBABLY NOCKING O BE AS AH THEY'RE NOCKING TO BE AS BRIGHT
1304,IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IN A SERIES CIRCUI DAY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY
1305,PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY HAVE TWO,PARALLEL THE CIRCUIT THEY HAVE TWO
1306,MARNIE,INY
1307,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I NOGHT REALLY NOW
1308,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1309,WELL THERE IS ON THERE'S ONLY W UM ONE PA UH THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THE THEY'RE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER,WELL THERE IT'S ON THERE'S ONLY O ONE PA THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THE THEIR THE LIUBS ARE BRIGHTER
1310,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY
1311,I DISCOVERED THAT UM IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIGHT IS THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME,I DISCOVERED THAT IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIKE IS THEYRE LIKE THE SAME
1312,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S A TWO PATHWAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE'S ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BULBS,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE IS A TWO PATHWAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE IS ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BUBES
1313,DIFFERENCES UM IS THAT THE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE SAME AND THEY'RE LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE IT'S THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ENOUGH ENERGY,DIFFERENCES ON IS THAT THE THE LIGHTBUBS ARE THE SAME AND THEY'R LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE ITS THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ENOUGH ENERGY
1314,BECAUSE THEN YOUR STRINGS WILL BE LIGHTER AND WHEN THERE'S MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE LIGHT,BECAUSE THEN YOUR STRINGS WILL BE LIGHTER AND WHEN THERE IS MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE LIGHT
1315,WELL THE ONE THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS,WELL THE ONE BOK THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS
1316,WELL IT H IT'S BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS A DEAD BATTERY IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE IT'S BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COULDN'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON,OH IT IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS A DEAD BATTERY AND COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO IT'S BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T WORKING SO OM SO IT COULDN'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON
1317,I'M AWESOME,MARTHAM
1318,UM WELL THEY'RE GOING THROUGH LIKE UM THEY GO AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THEY GO OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH AND THEN IN,UM WELL THEY ARE GOING THROUGH LIKE UM THEY GO AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THEY GO OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH AND THEN IN
1319,THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YOU'RE SEPARATING THE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER,THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCK STAY ND TOP OF ITS THEY ARE SEPARATING THE W THE ROCKS FROM THE WATE
1320,CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SIEVE BUT THE WATER AND THE MUD CAN,CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SEA BUT THE WATER AND THE MUD CAN
1321,THE THE UM SALT IS THE THAT THE THING IS THE BEST FOR THAT ONE BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES IT'S USING EVAPORATION TO GET RID OF THE WATER SO YOU CAN GET IT APART SO YOU JUST HAVE THE SALT,THE THE UMSSALT IS THAT THE THING IS THE BEST FOR THAT ONE BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES IT'S USING EVAPORATION TO GET RID OF THE WATER SOUKAN GET IT APART SO JUST HAVE THE SAL
1322,A SOLVENT,OVEN A SOL VINTOR
1323,THE PERSON'S USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PINS OUT,THREE THE PERSONS USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PINS OUT
1324,I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH,I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH
1325,GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS UM ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNET,GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS ATTRACTED TO MAGNET
1326,I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION I THINK IT'S A MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT LITTLE BIT OF MIXTURE,I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION I THINK IT'S A MOSTLY SOLUTION BUT LITTLE BIT OF MIXTURE
1327,BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICLE SIZES SO THAT THE ROCKS,BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICLE SIZE SO THAT THE ROCKS
1328,MIXTURES AREN'T ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER,MIXTURES ARE WHEN YOU MIX TO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER
1329,BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THE THE THE UM THE THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT THEY USE THE,BECAUSE YOU NEED GET THE MAG THE MAG THE UM THE THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT THEY USE A MAG

1530,CAN YOU HEAR ME,CAN YOU HEAR ME
1531,GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,GOOD HAVE BUT YOU
1532,CAN YOU HEAR ME,CAN YOU HEAR ME
1533,SO DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE,SO DO WANT TALK ABOUT SILENCE
1534,GOOD,GOO
1535,THAT THE SWITCH IS CLOSED SO THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET TO MAKE THE WASHERS ATTRACT TO THE RIVET STEEL,THAT THE SWITCH IS CLOTHES SO THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE STEAL RIBBOT TO MAKE THE WASHERS ATTRACT TO THE RIDI STEAL
1536,I DON'T,I NON
1537,THAT THE WIRE IS GETTING WRAP IS WRAPPED AROUND THE STEEL RIVET AND IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY,THAT THE WIRE IS GETTING WRAP IS WRAPPED AROUND THE SO THE BI AND CONNECT YOU TILL THE SWIDGE TO THE DEESAW THAT
1538,TO MEAN THAT THE MAGNET THE STEEL RIVET WOULDN'T ACTUALLY LAST THAT LONG BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MAGNET,TEMPORARY MAGMETS MEA THAT THE MAGONETE THE STEEL RIBBIT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY LAST THAT LONG CAUSE IT'S NOT A MAGNET
1539,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,A PAIRY LELL
1540,BYE,BA
1541,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW ENERGY SHOULD,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW ENERGY SURE
1542,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BECAUSE THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THE OTHER LYPALD LIKES BECAUSE THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
1543,THE ENERGY CAN FLOW TO THE OTHER ONE,THE ENERGY CAN FLOAW TO THE OTHER ONE
1544,UHM IT DOESN'T REALLY END UP,OH AT DOTHE RAING ANGER
1545,IT ALL STOPS,I THEY ALL STOP
1546,THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME,THERE IN A SEERY CIRCUIT ECOUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME
1547,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BACK TO THE,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIHT BALP TO THE BACK TO THE B
1548,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ON THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY BECAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ON THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY CAUSE IT IS TOO DIFFERENT PATHWAY
1549,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BURN OUT IT TURNS INTO AN OPEN CIRCUIT,WHEN ONE OF THE BULGS BEAR OW IT TURD INTO AN OPEN SHIRTAT
1550,INTO THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTO,UNTIL THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTO
1551,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WOR
1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,IHAVE BEEN SIX SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANYTHING
1553,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL,BECAUSE ONE LIKE ABL IS GETTING TOO MUCH IN REDEASED FL FULFILMENT W
1554,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A,A SERIOS CIRCET GOES ROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND E
1555,THAT THREE WIRES ON SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE,THAT THE THREE WIRES ON ONE SIDE A SHARIN THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEIR SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE BATT
1556,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILMMAN BREAKS THE ENERGY CANNOT GO THROUGH THE FILMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK
1557,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT,ONE LIGHT BALL HAS A BROKEN FILMIN AN THE OTHER ONE IS
1558,I KNOW THAT THEY'RE PARALLEL LINES,I KNOW THAT THEIR PARALLE LIGHT POO
1559,THE SECOND CIRCUIT,THE SECOND CIRCU
1560,GOOD,GOOD
1561,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH,THAT THE SWITCHER IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW T
1562,THEN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT'S NOT BURNT OUT,THAN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIPLL THAT IS NOT BURNED OUT
1563,WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS,WHEN THE VANET BREAK IN T LOP
1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,WE ARE NAS IIT TMUSKED
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BECAUSE THOUGH TWO LIPLS WAS SHARING IN HER
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,TE FLIM IS WORKING IN ONE OF THE BOBS THE ONE IF YOU GET EERY RIGHT WELMAN THE BOB WAS JI TIE TE B WODER WORKING
1567,I DON'T KNOW,THOW DON'T KNOW
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THE FILLMAN BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY
1569,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP,THE LILE OF A LITING UP AND SOME ONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN A FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP
1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,IT DOES NOTHING IT JIST BURNS OUT THE END
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE THE SWIT IS O
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,THAT SANS TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BALB ENERGY CANFOL TO THE OTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,I MUST AT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSS ACHE WAS TAT HADNT AT THAT THT O TAT THAT THAT THAT THT
1574,I DON'T KNOW,I NO
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,THE BOLD DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BOLT OES OUTLIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT VIPE
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,WELL THEN DO THAT WHEN THE BOLK BURN OU MIN ROUT SNAP MY PROBER
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,S ME SO GIDS SESON CITS PPIAN ARE A BIG CIRCLE LIKE  MEN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE O CIRCUIT
1578,WHAT THE ENERGY FLOWING ONE,MIN WAT THE ENERGY FLOWING ON WI
1579,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T MATTER,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T MATTER
1580,I KNOW IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS ON,I GO INTINT CLOTLE SACKET IS THE SWITCH IS A FI WAYOU
1581,THROUGH FILAMENTS AREN'T,TO FILMENTS ARE
1582,A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,A SERIOUS RECONT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE AND
1583,I THINK THE BULB IS NOT LIT UP BECAUSE IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OPEN,I THINK THE LAW WAS NOT LET OUT BECAUSE AT A CLOSSIR BECAUSE THE SWOTCHIS BOBAN
1584,WHAT'S YOUR NAME,WHAT YOUR NAME
1585,ONE LIGHT BULB'S HAVING TOO,THE ONE LIPE OF IS HAVING TO
1586,THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED TO THE D CELL,THE RAW CONDUCTEDTO THE GEE SHELL
1587,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY,THAT TWO LIPALBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIPEALL HAS A BROKEN FILAMEN IN THE OTHER DOZEN SOUL THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY
1588,THAT ONE OF THEM IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILAMENT IS,THAT ONE OF THET IS NOT BURNED OUT AND NEELIN ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILMENT IS BU
1589,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S AWESOME,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS OFSO
1590,BECAUSE THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT,BECAUSE THE SEERY CIRKEY A SHORT
1591,STOP STOPS GLOWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB,STOP IT STOPS FROWING BECAUSE A LIHEFALL
1592,THAT,TOUT W
1593,WE TOOK SOME STEEL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ATTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE TOOK SOME STEAL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT EXTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T
1594,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRIED USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NOR TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD BIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP
1595,THEY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE,ADE ON STICK IS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIN STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE
1596,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS TICK ALL TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
1597,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
1598,THE NAILS AND THE PAPER CLIP,THE NAIL  AND THE PAPER CLIP
1599,SINCE THEY ATTRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS,ANCE THEY ETRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES PENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS
1600,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT
1601,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF,A LOT OF TIMES ITS STEEL OR METL STUFF
1602,O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO,OU THAT THE NE HOPE JUST KINA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
1603,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF F WOULD C WOULD MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF WOULD CO AND MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT I COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF
1604,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
1605,AND THE ROCK THE S STEEL ROCK,IN THE ROCK THE STEEL ROCK
1606,YES,YES
1607,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE N NET THE NAIL DID,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLLIP AND THE NET THE NAIL DID
1608,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM STAY LIKE THA,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM STAY LIKE
1609,YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THEY'LL DEPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,YES BECAUSE CARBOARD A THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARBOARD BUT THI CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THILE THING PENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS
1610,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T,YR SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME TSOME OF THE IRON FILINS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T
1611,THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET,OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
1612,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER,HEHE IT COMES TOGETHER
1613,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE TH THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T G ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,THEY CAN ATTRAC THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T A TRACK THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULDN AT TRACK THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
1614,WE HAVE PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK S STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ONTO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT,WE HAVE PUT THEM AN BOXES AND THEN TOOKS STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE BECAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ON TO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT
1615,GOOD,GOOD
1616,YEAH SOMETIMES,YEAR SOMETIMES
1617,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND M ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY BY LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY CLOSE LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW
1618,TTRACTED EACH OTHER,CTIRTY CHAPIN
1619,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNETS RUBBED ON TH THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNE IT MAKES IT M A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SENCE THE MAGNET RUBBED ON THE THUS DEAL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAG N IT MAKES IT A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIB
1620,IT IT STUCK ON ONTO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK T AS WELL,IT IT STUCK ON ON TO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES STOODN'T STICK AS WELL
1621,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH AND WHAT WOULDN'T
1622,THEY'RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER,ITHEY ARE DETRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
1623,THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER,THEY CRACKED AT EACH OTHER
1624,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS A MAGNET,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONGS MAC
1625,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STAY LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STILL LIKE THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD
1626,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
1627,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS SO FIND AND YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS IL YOU COULD FIND IN YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN
1628,MAGNET DID,MAGNET DEAD
1629,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
1630,THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK,THEY ATTRACED EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT THREUG THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK
1631,THE UM THE WHAT WAS IT CALLED THE UM,THE UM THE PO THE UM
1632,THE BATTERY UM TELLS THEM THE THE M,THE BATTERY UM TELLS THEM THE THEM
1633,THEY HAVE TO TOUCH IT OR ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY TOUCHING IT BUT IT HAS TO BE PRETTY NEAR OF IT NEAR IT REALLY BY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY BUT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING IT LITTLE BIT,THEY HAVE TO TOUCH IT OR ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY TOUCHING IT BUT IT HAS TO BE PRETTY NEAR OF IT NEAR IT REALLY CLOSE DOESNT HAVE TO BE EXACTLY BUT HAS TO BE TOUCHING IT LITTLE BIT
1634,THE MOTOR IS GOING FROM ALL OF IT THE UM THE BATTERY HAS THE TWO THE OF THEM THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH HAS THEM ALL CONNECTED AND SINCE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED IT MAKES THE MOTOR GO,THE MOTOR IS GOING FROM ALL F IT THE UM THE BATTERY HAS THE TWO ITHAT OF THEM THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH HAS THEM ALL CONNECTED AND SINSE THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND MAKES THE MOTOR GO
1635,AND THE LIGHT BULB CAN FEEL IT COMING THROUGH SO IT TURNS ON AND IT GOES DOWN THROUGH THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE AND IT GOES BACK AND THEN IT GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY,AND THE LIGHT BULB CAN FEEL IT COMING THROUGH SO IT TURNS ON AND IT GOES DOWN THROUGH THERE'S ANOTHER WARE AND IT GOES BACK AND THEN THEY GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
1636,IT LOOKED THE SAME,IT LOOKED THE SAME
1637,WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO,WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO
1638,WELL UM THE BATTERY,WELL ON THE BATTERY
1639,GOOD,GOOD
1640,THE BATTERY PUSHES IT TO THE MOTOR NO MATTER W WAY IT GOING IT WILL JUST GO A DIFFERENT WAY,THE BATTERY PUSHES IT TO THE MOTIVE NO MATTER WHAT WAY GOING AND WILL JUST GO A DIFFERENT WAY
1641,WE TOOK A BATTERY AND A WIRE AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP WITH ANOTHER ONE THAT ANOTHER CLIP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY THAT CONNECTED TO A SWITCH AND THE SWITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE CLIP HAD A WIRE THAT CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT WHICH WOULD HELP IT,WE TOOK A BATTERY AND A WIRE AND CONNECTED IT TO TH LITTLE CLIP WITH ANOTHER ONE THAT ANOTHER CLIP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY THAT CONNECTED TO A SWITCH AND THE SWITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE CLIP HADDED WIRE THAT CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT WHICH WOULD HELP IT
1642,BY THE BATTERY,BY THE BATTERY
1643,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB IS ON,BECAUSE THE LIPE BULB IS ON
1644,WE TOOK ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP NEXT TO THE BATTERY THAT KEPT IT BY THE BATTERY AND THEN WITH THE OTHER ONE WE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE ONE WITHOUT THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN WE DID IT WITH THE SWITCH WE TOOK IT AND WE GOT THIS PIECE OF WIREISH THING AND WE CONNECTED ONE END OF THE MOTOR'S WIRES TO IT TO THE CLIP AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER ONE AND CONNECTED IT TO A CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND THEN WITH THE WIRE WE CLIPPED IT ON THE OTHER CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND CONNECTED THAT ONE TO THE OTHER,WE TOOK ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP NEXT TO THE BATTERY THAT KEPT IT BY THE BATTERY AND THEN WITH THE OTHER ONE WE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE ONE WITHOUT THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN WE DID IT WITH THE SWITCH WE TOOK IT AND WE GOT THIS PIECE OF WIRES THING AND WE CONNECTED ONE END OF THE MOTORS WIRES TO IT TO THE CLIP AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER ONE AND CONNECTED IT TO E CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND THEN WITH THE WIRE WE CLIPPED IT ON THE OTHER CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND CONNECTED THAT ONE TO THE OTHER
1645,IS HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING,I'S HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING
1646,LITTLE THINGS I FORGOT THE NAME OF THEM GO THROUGH THE WIRE IN THROUGH THEM LIKE DON'T GO THROUGH THEM BUT KINDA GO AGAINST AND KINDA GO THROUGH IT FEELS KINDA LIKE,LITTLE THINGS I FORGOT THE NAME OF THEM GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND THROUGH THEM LIKE I DON'T GO THROUGH THEM BUT KIND OF GO AGAINST AND KIND I GO THROUGH A FEELS KIND LIKE
1647,WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY,WE HAVE BEEN DOING A ELECTRICITY
1648,TODAY WE UM TOOK A MOTOR AND A BATTERY AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO THEN WE TOOK THE MOTOR AND A BATTERY WITH THE SWITCH AND TRIED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY,TO DAY WE TOOK A MOTOR AND A BATTERY AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO THEN WE TOOK THE MOTOR IN A BATTERY WITH THE SWITCH AND TRIED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY
1649,THESE LITTLE MICROSCOPIC UM THING MICROSCOPIC UM,THESE LITTLE MICROSCOPICUM MICROSCOPICUM
1650,THE BATTERY IS GIVING THE WI GIVING SOME TO TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON THE BATTERY'S PUTTING THE S UH IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE WIRES WHICH THAT A THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH HAS IS THERE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS THERE AND THE SWITCH WHEN IT GOES OVER THERE IT HITS THAT IT MAKES THE BATTERY KNOW AND THEN IT TELLS THE MOTOR TO GO ON,THE BATTERY IS GIVING THTHE WHITE GIVING SOME TO TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON THE BATTERY'S PUTTING THE IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE WIRES WHICH THAT THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND TO THE SWITCH AS IS THERE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS THERE AND THE SWITCH WHEN IT GOES OVER THERE IT HITS THAT IT MAKES THE THE BATTERY NO AND THEN TELLS THE MOTOR TO GO ON
1651,THE UM MOTOR DOESN'T REALLY UM IT GOES THE A DIFFERENT WAY SO SINCE THE BATTERY IS FLIPPED,THE UM MOTOR DOESN'T REALLY OH IT GOES THE A DIFFERENT WAY SO SENSE THE BATTERYS FLITE
1652,THE BATTERY IS THERE AND THE WIRE SINCE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS IS GOING THROUGH IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB,THE BATTERY IS THERE AND THE WIRE IS ANCS ITS CONNECTED TO THE LIPBULBS IT IS GOING THROUGH IT IS GOING TO THE LIPBULB
1653,THAT IS THE SWITCH TURNING THE MOTOR ON BY IT'S GOING BY THAT THAT'S HITTING IT TO MAKE THE WIRE KNOW THAT'S THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE MOTOR,THAT IS THE SWITCH TURNING THE MOTOR ON BY IT'S GOING BY THAT THAT'S HITTING IT TO MAKE THE WIRE KNOWLET'S THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE MOTOR
1654,GOOD,GIRT
1655,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1656,IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THEY WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING,IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY YOU KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
1657,WE HAD HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE CHARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY,WE HAD HAD TO WRAPP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP ECAUSE WE WERE CHARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THAN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY
1658,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH
1659,IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SWIT SWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND TO MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT THERE IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AGAIN,IT'S COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE DECEIL GOING THROUGH TO THE SWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNIT IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND TO MONEY EVER MANY TIMES THAT IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER
1660,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MINUS SIGN WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY A LITTLE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND TO PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRY TO PICK THEM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MIDEST SIGN HOW WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD A CONNECTING THE SWITCH ANT A BATTER IN THE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THE UM THIS MEDDLE THING AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRID TO PICK EM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRABEM OFF INSTEAD
1661,YES,YES
1662,THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND INSTEAD TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE,THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND INSTA  TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE
1663,YES,YES
1664,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL IS IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS A MAGNET WE WOULDN'T USE WE'LL NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOMETHI A SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PICK,THE WHITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE DESAIL IS IT IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FOR WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS MAC WE WOULDN'T USE WED NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKIN SOM A SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PIC
1665,IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS THEN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP,IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS THAN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP
1666,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND OUR HOU IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT SO WE DON'T TO TO PUT THEM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US IF WE DON'T TO GRAB HEM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK HIM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT SO WE DON'T S TO TO PUT HIM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB EM OFF INSTEAD
1667,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS GREAT,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS RIGHT
1668,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
1669,BECAUSE OF MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING MORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING IT A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE,BECAUSE THE MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING MORE OFITS FLOWING THROUGH WT AND ITS BUILDING MAKING ITS A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE BET BATTERY AND GO ROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE
1670,WELL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO AS A MAGNET SO UM WE THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS,WHILE WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO OF AS A MAGNET SO WAT THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNET WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS
1671,IT IS THE ELEC TRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK,IT IS THE ECELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
1672,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STONGER,MORE WASHUGRS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STRONGER
1673,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAG
1674,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNAY IT ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
1675,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND IT HOW IT'S IT NEEDS TO GET AROUND THOSE WIRES,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT OW IT MUST SPE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTER AND COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND HOW IT'S IN ENATIGY AROUND THOSE WIRERS
1676,I SEE THAT UHM THE WASHERS JUST GOT PICKED UP,I SEE THAT THE WASHERS SOU STOP PICKED UP
1677,BECAUSE ENERGY MUST BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND ENERGY KIND OF I DON'T KNOW,BEAK  AS ENERGY MUST PE IT THROUGH IN AND ERGYOU TIS I DON'T KNOW
1678,THAT IT LOOKS LIKE UHM THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY COOL AND UHM THERE'S ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT GOES OUT,THAT A LOTS LIKE A THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON DOING THROUGH THE WIRE IT CAN  IT LOOKS FEELY CRUEL AND UN THERE IS ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT GOES OUT
1679,UHM UHM YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOU'RE ABLE ACTUALLY MAKE A MAGNET TO TURN IT ON AND OFF,U UM YOU MUST MAKE TRE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOU ARE ABLE TO AXHLY MAKE ON THATNET WEARE ABLE TO FIT IT ON AN O
1680,THE RIVET MUST BE STEEL,RIN THAT MUST BE STILL
1681,GOOD HOW ARE YOU,GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
1682,UHM THAT IT PICKED UP THE UHM WHAT UHM,AND THA PICKED UP THE AMHOM  WHA IM
1683,IS ABLE TO TURN ON THE MAGNET ON AND OFF SO IF YOU TURN IT OFF THERE UHM UHM THE WASHERS WOULD FALL OFF IF YOU KEEP IT ON THE WASHERS WILL NOT FALL OFF,WAS ABLE TO TURN ON THE MAN ED ON AND OFF SO IF HE TRINIT OF THER WERE N THE RIVE ON THE WASHERS WOULD FALL OFF IF YEU KEEP IT ON THE WASHERS ROL NOT M
1684,YOU DO NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU WRAP UP ALL THE WIRES UHM GOOD BECAUSE I DID TRY DOING THAT BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK,YOU DO NEED TO MAKE HER RIGHT WRAP UP ALL THE WILER A OUD SIGHT TO TRY DOING THAT BUT WOENN'T WORS
1685,CLOSER NOT AN OPEN ONE TO CELL ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH,CLOSE SHIRTIN NOT AN OPEN ONE TO SELF AND REGITHENOT IT THROUGH
1686,SO UHM THE ENERGY CAN GET THROUGH IT SO TIRED,SO UN THE ENERGY KID IT THROUGH IT T
1687,UHM THE RIVET ALL THAT WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVETS HI HOW ARE YOU HI HI,IM THE RIVE ALL OUT WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET HI OR PIHI
1688,IT'S CLOSED IF IT'S TOUCHING THE METAL,LOSE IF IT'S TOUCHY THE BETTLE
1689,UHM IT'S USING ENERGY TO MAKE A MAGNET,ON THIS USING ENERGY TO MAKE A MARNET OP
1690,THE THE IT BECOMES A MAGNET,THE THER IF IT BECOMES A MAN A
1691,IT CAN'T PICK UP THE UHM IT CAN'T PICK UP THE WASHERS,IT CAN'T PICK UP THE UNIT CAN'T PICK UP THE WASHERS
1692,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY BECAUSE IT'S GETTING GIVING IT A LITTLE SHOCK MAYBE,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY HAVE GIVIN GIVING IT A LITTLE SHOCK MAYBE
1693,ENERGY MUST FLOW THROUGH,YE MUST FOIL THE THROUG
1694,IT KIND OF MEANS LIKE IT REMINDS ME OF BATTERIES AND UHM HOW MAGNETS WORKS,IT KANGAMIN SIGHTAN REMINDS TO BE OF BATTARIES AND OMHOW MAN THAT POR
1695,I CAN'T REMEMBER UHM IT WAS LAST FRIDAY,I CAN'T REMEMBER A MABLESTA FRIDAY
1696,YOU MUST HAVE IT FLOWING IN A YOU MUST HAVE A CLOSED CIRCUIT,YOU MUST HAVE IT FLOWING IN IT YOU MUST HAVE A CLOSE SERFA
1697,THAT IT IS IN A CIRCLE,TAT IT IS IN A CIRCLE
1698,THE SWITCH USUALLY WILL STOP AND MAKE THE ENERGY GO AND UHM THERE'S UHM WASHERS UHM THERE'S UHM WASHERS AND IT LOOKS LIKE AND UHM A WIRES AND D CELL BATTERY,WHICH USUALLY WILL STOP AND MAKE THE ENERGY GO AND ON THERE'S AWASHERS THERE'S AWASHERS AND ILSA AND A A WIRES AND DECENT BATTERY
1699,YOU WRAP IT UP ON,POOR RAPID A UN
1700,UHM YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BATTERY ELECTROMAGNET UHM YOU NEED UH YOU DO NEED ELECTRICITY IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK UHM,U YOU MUST MATURE Y HAVE A BANTERY ALECTROMANIC AH YOU NEED A YOU DO NEED MUC TRICITY IF YOU WANTED TO WORK UM
1701,THINK ABOUT WRAPPING THE WIRES AND UH MAKING SURE THE ENERGY'S ABLE TO FLOW,THINK ABOUT WRAPPING THE WIERS TAND OF MAKTING SOR THAT ENERGYIS ABLE TO FLO
1702,IF UHM IF IT WAS UHM UHM IT WAS CLOSED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO IT WOULD UH IF IT'S CLOSED UHM ENERGY COULD GO THROUGH IF IT'S NOT CLOSED LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH,IF A  IF IT WAS SONE IN IT WAS  LOST WOULD BE EASER TO IT WOULD IF IT SOSE AN ENERGY TO UMOTHROUGH IF IT'S NOT CLOSE LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW ENERGY CANP IT THROUGH
1703,STEEL LIKE STEEL STEEL I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT UHM STEEL STEEL SORRY I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT BUT IT STARTS WITH STEEL I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PRONOUNCING IT RIGHT,STILL LATE STEEL STILL I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT I'M STILL STEEL SOR Y CAN'T NOUT BUT START TO A STEEL I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PRONOUNCING IT RIHT
1704,IT WOULD PROBABLY BECOME A MAGNET FOR A FEW SECONDS OR MINUTES IF SO IF THE WIRE WAS ON IT IT WOULD STAY A MAGNET FOR A LONG TIME WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THE UHM WIRE IT WILL PROBABLY STAY A MAGNET FOR JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS OR A MINUTE,WOULD POLL YOU BECOME A MAN NAT FOR A FEW SUD CONCORNMENTS IF SO IF THE WIRE IS ON IT IT WOULD STAY A NAT FOR TIME WHEN YOU TAKE OUF THE WIRE IT WILL POLLY STAY A MAN I FOR JUSE A FEW MORE SECOND OR A MINUTE
1705,THE WIRES SUPPOSED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIVET SO ENERGY CAN GET TO THE RIVET AND MAKE IT INTO ELECTRIC ELECTROMAGNET,THE WIRES MUST BE TORNETED TO THE RIBBOT SO ENERGY TO GET TO THE RIBVER AN MAKE INTO A TRIP ANT YOU BETTER OL YOU MAR DAT
1706,IT'S A PARALLEL,IT'S A PEERER AWELL
1707,THE OTHER GOES OUT,THE THERE DOES
1708,UHM THE ENERGY KEEPS ON GOING,AN THE ENERGY KEEPS ON DARWING
1709,SERIES CIRCUITS ARE LIKE STRINGS OF LIGHTS,DEARY SHIRP HAAD OE NIGT PUSSERING SO IT
1710,THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL STILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY THAT KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH,THAT THE LIGTBALL WILL STILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY THAT KEEPS ON DOING THROUGH
1711,BECAUSE UHM BECAUSE ENERGY CAN NOT GET THROUGH IT'S OPEN,BECAUSE UM BECAUSE ENRERGY CANNOT ET THROU IT OPEN
1712,THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP,THAT THE LIPOBS O LITER
1713,UHM IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUIT A PARALLEL,ON A  SCR SEKER OF ARABTA
1714,BECAUSE ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH CORRECTLY,HIL'S ENERGY CANNOT FOLLOW WHEREY DIRRECT
1715,IT STOP,IT TOT NOT
1716,UHM THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE FLINT BURNS OUT,UM THE LIFE ALL CAN'T LIND UP BECAUSE THE FRONT WHAT BURNS A
1717,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,IPARALLELS
1718,THE ENERGY DID NOT GET THROUGH,BE ENERGID NOT ET THROUG
1719,NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO THE OTHER BULB,PURE NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO THE OTHER BOB
1720,THEY SOMETIMES ARE VERY BRIGHT,FACE TIMES OR VARY B
1721,JUST STAY OUT,OR JUST STAY OUT
1722,NOT ALL OF THEM WILL BURN OUT BUT JUST THAT ONE WILL BURN OUT,NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BURN OUT BUT JUST THAT ONE WELL BURN OUT
1723,THE FILAMENT UHM BREAKS AND THE ENERGY ON THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER LIGHT BULB KEEPS ON GLOWING BUT THE ENERGY THAT'S TRYING TO GET TO THE UHM LIGHT BULB THAT HAS THE FILAMENT BROKEN IT JUST PAUSES AND STOPS LIKE A TRAFFIC JAM,THE FILLAMET UM BREATH AND THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER LIPE OF KITS ON GOING BUT THE ENERGIES THARE TRYING TO DIT TO THE UN LIKE ALL THAT HAS THE FILMENT BROKEN THEJUST PAUSES AND STOPS LIKE THE TRAFFIC JAAM
1724,UHM THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN BUT UHM WHEN WHEN THE FILAMENT BROKE ON THE OTHER PICTURE AND THE LIGHT BULBS KEPT ON GLOWING WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS IN THIS PICTURE THE LIGHT BULB DOESN'T GLOW,AM THE FILMEN IS BROTLYIN  BA AM WHEN WHEN THE FILME BRO ON THE OTHER PITCHOR THE END THE LIPOP TEPT ON GOING WHEN THE FILMENT BREATS IM THIS PICTHURE THE LIPEOUT DOESIN GO
1725,A SERIES CIRCUIT,A THEORISTER
1726,ENERGY NEED TO THROUGH IT OR MAYBE THE IS EITHER OLDER OR THERE'S TOO MUCH ENERGY,AND HER GENIE TO SET THROUGH AND MAY BE THE FONTE MAN IS EITHER OLD OR THERE WAS TOO MUCH ENERGY
1727,BECAUSE OF THE FLINT IF THE FLINT BURNS OUT THAT MEANS ENERGY CAN NOT PASS,BECOVER OF THE FLINT IF THE FLINT BURNS OUTS THAT MEANS ENERGY CANNOT PASS
1728,I SEE THAT AND THAT UHM ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH IT IS OPEN,I SEE THAT AND THAT OM ENERGY CANNOT BE THROUGH IN HIS OPEN
1729,I AM GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,I AM GOOD ABOUT Y
1730,THE IT JUST SHOWS YOU THAT'S BROKEN IT DOESN'T THE BULB UHM BURNING OUT IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU THAT UHM THE FILAMENT BURNED OUT,WITHE ITER SHOWS YOU THE FILMENT THAT'S BROKEN IT DOS THE BOB UNBURNY OW IT SUST SHOWIN YOU THAT THE FILL MAN UNBURNED
1731,WE DIDN'T DO SCIENCE BECAUSE IT'S A TUESDAY,WE DIDN' IT THAT A TOS SIGNS BECAUSE ITS I TU STAY
1732,BECAUSE CAN'T GET THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND GO TO THE UHM OTHER LIGHT BULB,BECAUSE ENERGY CAN'T DICE THROUGH THE FLYMET AND LOTO ON ETHERLIP
1733,UHM THE FILAMENT BROKE BUT THEY STILL BUT THE TWO OTHER LIGHT BULBS CAN STILL GET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY,ON THE FILM IT BROKE BUT THEY SAW BUT THE TWO OTHER LIPOBS TEN SOTET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE AL TERNECTEDTO THE BATTERY
1734,UHM THE FLINT BURNS OUT,ON THE FLANTBURN COW
1735,THAT THE IT'S ONE LIGHT BULB'S ABLE TO LIGHT UP BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN WIRES AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REALLY SHARE ENERGY THE OTHER CAN'T BECAUSE THE FLINT BURNED OUT,THAT THE ITS AN ONE LIGHT BOBB IS ABLE TO LIGHT UP BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN WIDERS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REALLY SARE ENERGY THE OTHER CAMP BECAUSE O
1736,THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB LIT UP BECAUSE UHM IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT,THE WRIPOR ITER THE RIPE OUT LITTEP BECAUSE AND IT IS A POS OTED
1737,THEY ARE KIND OF A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS USUALLY KIND OF STRAIGHTER,THE ARSTINA AN A PIAROS WERKAS USUALLY HIN STRAITER
1738,WHEN THE BULB NOTHING THE ENERGY CAN'T GET THROUGH,THAN ABOV BRATS NOTHING IN THET ENERGY AND THE THOU
1739,BECAUSE THAT ONE BURNS OUT UHM THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS CAN'T GET THEIR ELECTRICITY,BECAUSE THAT ONE BURNT OUTS ON THE OTHER LIKE TOBS SCANTET THEIR ELECTRICITY
1740,NO I CAN'T,NO I CAN'T
1741,WELL THE BIG DROP GOES FASTER THAN THE LITTLE DROP BECAUSE THE LITTLE DROP IS LIKE SMALLER BUT I THINK BECAUSE THE BIG DROP HAS MORE DROPS IN IT THAT IT THAT IT'S LIKE,REALLY FAST

1881,YEAH HE LOOKS WEIRD BUT HE HE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL TOO,AREB  THAT YER LIKE YABEPAFUL YOU
1882,I,
1883,WE PUT BOTH OF THE WATERS IN AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT YOU PUT A THERMOMETER AFTER IN AFTER WE PUT MIXED THE WATERS TOGETHER AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE WHICH WAS TWENTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS,WE PUT BOWS ON YEL WATERS IN ADDED WE FIGURE OU DIT E QUIT A THRE LONGER AFTER IND AFTER BE  MAKES THEM WATERS TOGETHER AND AT TURNED OUT TO BE WEN TEMPTURE WHICH WAS TWENTY TWO MEET SELCIES
1884,SOME OF THEM HAVE CELSIUS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE FAHRENHEIT HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE USES CELSIUS BESIDES US,E ON  SURE A A WA YERONO NOW WE OM A RUNING OF HADS NOW OE ANS ONEN A HOT FAIR NIGHT ER HOLDING  OS EVERY ONE NISIS SOUNDS SOS PRECISENON TAN TROE OINTY OLAND OF THE CHI ABUS

1890,YES,YOU YNOTHING
1891,WELL HOW HOW IS HE,WELL HOW HOW IS YO
1892,I'M GOOD AND HOW ARE YOU,I'M RAIN HOW ARE YOU
1893,THAT THE PAPER CLIP WOULD WEIGH I MEAN GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP WOULD WEIGH MORE THAN THE OTHER THINGS THEY'RE WEIGHING IN GROUP ONE'S WOULD WEIGH UM LESS AG AGAINST THE OTHER THING,THAT THE PAPER LIP WOULD WAY A MEAN GROUPD NEWSPAPER CLAP WOULD WAY MORE THAN THE OTHER THINGS THEIR WING AND GROUP ONE WOULD WAY OM LESS A AGAINST THE OTHER THINGS
1894,YES I THINK THAT WAS THE WAIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT,YES I THINK THAT WAS THA WAIT IDON'T NOW WHAT THEN
1895,THEY'RE ABOUT HOW TO WEIGH S UM SMALL THINGS LIKE YOU CANNOT WEIGH A UM YOU WELL GRAMS ARE USED FOR WEIGHING SMALL THINGS,THERE ABOU HOW TO WAY UM SMALL THINGS LIKE YOU CANNOT WAY A UM YOU WELL GRIMS ARE USED FOR WEINING SMALL THINGS
1896,WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING WEIGHT AND HOW HEAVY THINGS ARE,WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING WAIT AND HOW HEAVY THINGS ARE
1897,BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WEIGHING VERY VERY BIG THINGS WE'RE WEIGHING KIND OF SMALL THINGS LIKE A DICE AND OTHER SMALL THINGS LIKE THAT,BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WEIGHING VERY VERY BIG THINGS WERE WEIGHING KIND OF SMALL THINGS LIKE A DICE AND OTHER SMALL THINGS LIKE THAT
1898,AND THAT'S KIND OF IT,AND THAT'S KIND OF IT
1899,GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP IS BIGGER THAN GROUP ONE'S SO MAYBE GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP WEIGHS MORE THAN GROUP ONE'S,GROUP TOOSPAPER CLIP IS BIGGER THAN GROUP ONE SO MAYBE GROUP TEWSPAPER CLEP WAYS MORE THAN GROUP ONES
1900,GOOD,GOOD
1901,MMM YES,YES
1902,WE USED A,WE USEJE
1903,WELL UM WE MEASURED A UM APPLE IN OUR CLASS IT UM IT DIDN'T LOOK IT WEIGHED TOO MUCH IT WASN'T THAT BIG BUT IT WAS A LOT OF UM GRAMS WE'VE BEEN MEASURING IN GRAMS,WELL UM WE MEASURED A UM APPLE IN OUR CLASS A UM DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAIGHED MUCH IT WASN'T THAT BIG BUT IT WAS A LOT OF UM GRAHAMS WE'VE BEEN MEASURING IN GRANTS
1904,METERS CENTIMETERS METERS AND MILLIMETERS,METER SENIMETERS AND METER MILAMETERS
1905,BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES PAPER CLIPS CAN BE ANY SIZE IT COULD BE BIG PAPER CLIPS SMALL PAPER CLIPS BUT GRAMS ARE ONLY ONE KIND THERE'S ONE GRAM,BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE DIFFERENT SIZEHES PAPERCLIPS CAN BE ANY SIZE IT COULD BE BIG PAPERCLIP SMALL PAPER CLLIPSE BUT GRAHAMS ARE ONLY ONE KIND THIS ONE GRAHAM
1906,THAT EACH UM PAPER CLIP IS WEIGHING I MEAN YEAH EACH PAPER CLIP IS WEIGHING MORE SINCE THEY'RE IN A I DON'T KNOW,THAT EACH ON PAPER CLIP IS WEIGHING I MEAN YE EACH PAPER CLIP IS WEIGING MORE WAS SENSTER IN A OUT
1907,UM WE'VE USED I THINK SO FAR WE'VE ONLY USED CRAYONS CA,UM WE'VE USED I THINK SO FAR WE'VE ONLY USED GROUNDS
1908,UM I GUESS SO BUT I'M MORE I'M BETTER AT WEIGHING WITH GRAMS,AMI GUESS SO BUT I'M MORE I'M BETTER OUT WAN WITH GRAMPS
1909,I GUESS THERE'S ONE GROUP O OF THERE'S A TWO A GROUP THAT SAYS NUMBER TWO AND A GROUP THAT SAYS NUMBER ONE I GUESS THE UM NUMBER TWO GROUP HAS THE SOME PAPER CLIPS IN THEM THEY'RE WEIGHING PAPER CLIPS AND GROUP ONE IS WEIGHING DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE GROUP TWO IS HOW MUCH IS UM EACH UM PAPER CLIP UM WEIGHS,I GUESS THERE'S ONE GROUP A OF THERE'S THE TWO A GROUP THAS IS NUMBER TWO IN A GROUP THATS IS NUMBER ONE I GUESS THEUM NUMBER TWO GROUP HAS THE SOME PAPER CLUPS IN THEM THERE WING PAPER CLUBS IN GROUP ONE IS WAITING DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE GROUP TO IS HOW MUCH IS A EACH PAPER CLIP  WAISTS
1910,THAT THEY FOUND OUT THE PLASTIC DISK IS UM FOUR GRAMS AND SINCE THEY WEIGHED WITH SOMETHING UM LESS IS HEAVY IT LOOKED LIKE THE OTHER THING WAS LESS HEAVY,THAT THEY FOUND OUT THE PLASTIC DISK IS UM FOR GRAMS AND SINCE THEY WEIGHED WITH SOMETHING UM LESSIS HEAVY IT LOOKED LIKE THE OTHER THING WAS CLAST HIVY
1911,I SEE TWO PIECES OF A BALANCE AND TWO CUPS,I SEE TWO PIECES OF BOUNDCE AND TWO CUPS
1912,YOU PUT ONE THING IN WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTING ONE THING IN IN ONE CUP ONE THING IN THE OTHER AND SEEING IF WE COULD MAKE EACH ONE EXACTLY THE SAME WEIGHT,YOU PUT ONE THING WHILE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING ONE THING ON IN ONE CUP ONE THING IN THE OTHER AND SEING IF WE COULD MAKE EACH ONE EXACTLY THE SAME WEIGHT

1935,THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP,THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE DECAILS SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
1936,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A LITTLE TUBE BUT THERE IS A THIN WIRE BETWEEN IT THAT MAKES THE ENERGY SQUEEZE THROUGH IT GOING OUT IT GOING OUT IT GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AGAIN AND RECYCLING IT THROUGH THE BATTERY,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A LITTLE TUBE BUT THERE IS A THIN WIRE BETWEEN IT THAT MAKES THE ENERGY SQUEEZE THROUGH IT GOING OUT IT GOING OUT IT GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AGAIN AND WE SIKLING IT THROUGH THE BATTERY HUH TALK TALK TALK YOU DON'T AUNT JIMMIE U HUH U
1937,TELL YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT,TELL YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT
1938,KINETIC ENERGY AND THEN CLOSED CIRCUIT,CONNECTIC ENERGY AN AN CLOSED CIRCUIT
1939,ARE SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DEVICE OR LIGHT BULB SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE,ARE SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DEVICE OR LIGHT BULB SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
1940,I'M TALKING ALL RADICAL COME ON WOMAN TELL ME SOME ANSWERS,EE N  YOUR ASI'M TALKING ALL RATICAL  DOT  WAA E COME ON WOMAN COE ME SOM AT
1941,ENERGY,G
1942,OKAY,AL PHA
1943,I NOTICE THAT IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP,I NOTICED THAT IT  MAKING THE LIPL BLIGHT OUT
1944,I THINK I NEVER MIND,I  I THINK I'D NEVER MIND
1945,I SEE A CIRCUIT,I SEE A CIRCUIT
1946,BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TO SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN,BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TO SHOW THE LIGHTBOLDS CAN
1947,THE NEGATIVITY SIDE,TO NEGGER GI E TEASIDE
1948,I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
1949,IT FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES GOING TO THE CASING OF THE BULB AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BULB GOING OUT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE MAKING THE BULB HAVE A CIRCUIT LIGHTING IT UP,IT FLEWS BY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES GOING TO THE CASING OF THE BULB AND THERE IS ANOTHER ONE CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BULB GOING OUT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE MAKING THE BULB HAVE A CIRCUIT LINING IT THE
1950,I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THIS,I NOTICED THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE TE
1951,I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COURSE,I NOTICED THAT ITS LIGHTING UP OF CO
1952,THINK THAT IT WILL NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE NEEDS ONE TO BE AT THE SIDE OF THE BULB FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW OUT CAUSE IF IT'S AT THE BOTTOM THEN THERE'S ONLY JUST ONE BULB CONNECTING TO IT OR I MEAN WIRE,INK THAT IT WILL NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE NEEDS ONE TO BE AT THE SIDE OF THE BULB FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW OUT CAUSE IF IT'S AT THE BOTTOM THEN THERE IS ONLY JUST ONE BULB CONNECTING TO IT OR NE WIRE
1953,IS A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT,IS A PASTHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UMLIKT BULBLI
1954,THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW IF THE ENERGY IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH OR NOT,THE FLAG IS SPITTING AND  IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW IF THE ENERGY IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH OR NOT
1955,I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THAT OTHER METAL CONNECTED TO THE WIRE IT GOES BUT WHEN IT IS NOT AND IT IS SEPARATED IT DOES NOT GO,I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THAT OTHER METAL CONNECTED WITH E WIRE IT GOES BUT WHEN IT IS NOT AND IT IS SEPARATED IT DOES NOT GO
1956,MEANS THE THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY ABSORBING IT MAKING IT GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR,MEANS THIS THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUM'S ENERGY ABSORBING IT MAKING GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
1957,VERY AWESOMENESS,ERY OSOMNESS
1958,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT
1959,WHAT MUST HAPPEN IS ENERGY MUST GO THROUGH THE WIRES GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT THE FLAG GO TO YOUR,WHAT MUST HAPPEN IS ENERGY MUST GO THROUGH THE WIRES GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT THE FLAG GO TO YOU ARE NONSKI
1960,IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE A BATTERY YOU CAN OUT IN THE SUN AND THEN IT WILL GET AND THEN IT WILL GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN IF IT IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRE THE ENERGY WILL FLOW THROUGH THE WIRE TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BUILD IT FROM,ULL OF POUD GETTING IF YOU DON'T WARNT A WASTE OF BATTERY YOU CAN GO OUT IN THE SUN AND THEN IT WILL GE AND THEND IT WILL GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN IF IT IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRE THE ENERGY WILL FLOW THROUGH THE WIRE TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BUILD IT FROM
1961,YOU TOO,YOU TOO
1962,THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING,THE FLAG IS MOVI
1963,WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT FLOW THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW THROUGH TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT NOT CONNECT AND MAKING IT NOT GO,WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT FLOAW THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW THROUGH TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT NOT CONNECT AND NOT MAKING IT GO
1964,CELL IS FACING THE SUN MAKING THE SUNS ENERGY CONNECT THROUGH CONNECT THROUGH TO THE UM TO THE SOLAR TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO,SHELL IS INFACING THE SUN MAKING THE SUN'S ENERGY CONNECT THROUGH CONNECT THROUGH TO THE UM TO THE SOLARS TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR MAKING GO
1965,THAT MAKES THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES MAKING IT GO TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT UM UM HAVE ENERGY MAKING IT UM GO,THAT MAKES THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES MAKING GET GO TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT UM UM HAVE ENERGY MAKING IT UM GO
1966,A COMPLETE CIRCUIT SO YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE UM SWITCH BACK BECAUSE THE ENERGY HAS CONNECTED TO THAT THING THAT THE WIRES CONNECTED TO WITH THE SWITCH AND THE SWITCH HAS TO CONNECT TO THE OTHER WIRE OR METAL SO THE ENERGY IS CONNECTED TO THE METAL SO IT WILL GO THROUGH TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT GOING LIGHTING UP THE MOTOR EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID OR WHATEVER,A COMPLETE TOOK IT SO YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE UM SWITCH BACK BECAUSE THE ENERGY HAS CONNECTED TO THAT THING THAT THE WIRE IS CONNECTED O WITH THE SWITCH AND THE SWITCH AS TO CONNECT TO THE OTHER WIRE OR METAL SO THE ENERGY IS CONNECTED TO THE METAL SO IT WILL GO TTO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT GOING LIGTING UP THE MOTOR EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID OR WHATEVER
1967,THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FACING THE SUN,THE STOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FACING THE SUN
1968,WHAT ISN'T HAPPENING IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGY,WHAT IS IT HAPPENING IS IN THE CIRCUTES ENERGY
1969,IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP,IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN'S TO THE SOLAR SHELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
1970,THE SUN MAKES IT COME TO A REALLY SUNNY DAY MAKING THE SOLAR CELL ABSORB THE SUNS ENERGY GOING THOUGH THE WIRES UM CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO BUT IF IT IS A UM CLOUDY DAY THEN THERE IS NO SUN TO HAVE THE SOLAR CELL UM ABSORB ENERGY FROM SO IT WILL SO THERE IS NO ENERGY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES UM GOING TO THE MOTOR NOT MAKING IT RUN,THE SUN MAKES IT COME TO A EARLY SUNNY DAY MAKING THE SOILAR SELL ABSORB THE SUN'S ENERGY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AM CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO BUT IF IT IS A UM CLOUDY DAY THEN THERE ARE NO SUN TO HAVE THE SOLER SHELL UM CAN ABSORB ENERGY FROM SO I WILL SO THERE IS NO ENERGY GOING TO THE WIRES AM GOING TO THE MOTOR NOT MAKING IT RUN TALK
1971,THIS IS ABOUT THE SWITCHES GOING SO IT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TURN IT OFF AND ON WITHOUT MOVING THE WIRES,THIS IS ABOUT THE SWITCHES GOING SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TURN IT OFF AND ON WITHOUT MOVING THE WIRE ZA
1972,THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN,IS THE EN SHE IS GOING THROUGH HER CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING GET RUN
1973,THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT ABSORB ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND IT WOULD STOP,THE SHOULDERS SELL WOULD NOT ABSORB ENERGY FROM THE SEM AND IT WOULD STOP
1974,WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE D CELL GOING OVER CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING THE MOTOR RUN AND IT IS GOING TO A THROUGH A THROUGH A CIRCUIT,WHY IS AR CONNECTING TO THE DETAIL GOING OVER CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING THE MOTOR RUN AND IT IS GOING TO A CIRT THROING THROUGH A CIRC
1975,I NOTICE THAT IT IS,AND NOTICED THAT IT IS GO
1976,CLOSED,CLOSED
1977,CAUSE IT IS NOT A FULL COMPLETE CIRCUIT,COUSIT IS NOT A FAR COMPLETE SECOND
1978,THE ENERGY WASN'T CONNECTING TO THE OTHER WIRE MAKING IT GOING TO MAKING IT NOT GOING TO A COMPLETE CIRCUIT MAKING IT NOT MOVE OR DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT NOW THAT THE WIRE NOW THAT THE SWITCH HAS BEEN CONNECTED IT IS GOING AGAIN BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLETE CIRCUIT NOW,THE ENERGY WASN'T CONNECTING OTHE OTHER WIRE MAKING IT GOING TO MAKING IT NOT GOING TO A COMPLETE CIRCUIT MAKING IT NOT MOVE OR DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT NOW THAT THE WIRE NOW THAT THE SWITCH HAS BEEN CONNECTED IT IS GOING AGAIN BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLETE CIRCUIT NOW
1979,I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING,I NOTICED THAT THATIT IS MY GOING
1980,THE THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR,THE ISTHE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING TO THE WIRES TO THE M
1981,IS SHOWING THAT THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES BOTH WIRES MAKING A CIRCUIT MAKING THE ENERGY MAKING THE ENERGY REUSE ITSELF GOING TO THE WIRE MAKING IT KEEP GOING FOREVER AND EVER UNLESS YOU MOVE A WIRE,SHOWING THAT THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES BOTH WIRES MAKING A CIRCUIT MAKING THE ENERG BE MAKING THE ENERGY REUSE ITSELF GOING TO THE WIRE MAKING IT KEEP GOING FOR EVER AND EVER UNLESS YOU MOVE A WIRE

2012,IT HAS TO FLOW AGAIN IN PRE CIRCUITS LIKE MELO AND CHEESE MAKES TOGETHER,YOFIT AS BEFORE I GET PREAC FERGIT WHY  MARLOW AND CHEESE MAXE TOGETHER
2013,THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPERCLIP BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIP IS METAL,THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIP IS METAL
2014,IT'S THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUITS OTHER CIRCUIT THAT IS ENERGY FLOWING BACK AROUND THROUGH THE D CELL LIKE IT IS EVERY USING THE ENERGY MAKING IT MOVE THROUGH THE D CELL,THAT THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT ARE THE CIRCUIT THAT IS THAT IS ENERGY IS FLOWING BACK AROUND THROUGH THE DECEIL LIKE IT IT IS A REUSING THE ENERGY MAKING IT NEW THROUGH THECELL
2015,THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THE POPSICLE WILL WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL,THE RODE IS NOT READING BECAUSE THE BAT DOPESO WILE THE STACK IS NOT MEN
2016,THE METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL,BE METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL
2017,THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH YOU KNOW THAT FUNKY STUFF,THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH AND ALL THAT PUNKY STEFF
2018,SAID THEY ARE ALL METAL,TAT THER ARM ET
2019,THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CANNOT FLOW THROUGH THEM,THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CANNOT FLOW THOUGH
2020,INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL METAL,BELATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METL MT AL
2021,IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT YOU JUST ESTABLISHED THAT,IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT METL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOT THROUGH IT WE JUST ESTABLISHED N
2022,GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,GOOD HAV AR YOU
2023,NOTICED THAT THEY ARE POPSICLE STICK IS NOT METAL AND IT'S WOOD SO THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THAT SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING,NOTICE THAT THE UM POPTICL STICK IS NOT MEDLE AND IT TWOOD SO THE ENERGY CAN'T FLOW THROUGH THAT TILL THE A MOTORS NOT RUNNING
2024,MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT'S METAL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE,BATE OF MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT IS METAL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE
2025,THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL,THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL ENERGY CAN FLIRT THROUGH METAL
2026,I OBSERVED THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL AND THAT SINCE METAL IT THE ENERGY IS FLOW LIKE THROUGH AND GOING TO THE MOTOR YEAH PRETTY WELL,I OBSERVE THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL AND THAT SINCE METAL I THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH AN GOING TO THE BUTTER Y PE
2027,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT OTHER METAL OBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT CAN CONNECT ENERGY TO WIND ENERGY SOURCE,HE HAVE BEEN ABOUT OTHER ON METAL OBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT CAN CONNECT ENERGY TO AN ENERGY SOURCE
2028,THE D CELL BATTERY HAS A WIRE THROUGH THE LEFT SIDE GOING TO THE LEVER THE LEVER IS OPEN BUT THE NAIL IS THERE AND ITS METAL SO THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH GOING TO THE OTHER WIRE GOING TO THE OTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO AND THEN THE RIGHT SIDE IS JUST THE WIRE GOING TO THE MOTOR,THE DESAIL BATTERY HAS THE WIRE THROUGH THE LEFT SIDE GOING TO THEY UNLEVER THE LEVER IS OPEN BUT THE NAIL IS THERE AND ITS MEDDLE SOAT THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH IT GOING TO THE OTHER WIRE GOING TO THE OTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING YOU GO IN THE RIGHT SIDE IS JUST THE WIRE GOING TO THE MOTER
2029,DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T MADE OF METAL,DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE INTMATE OF MEADOW
2030,IT IS MAGNETISM GOING THROUGH THE TABLE,IT IS MAGNETISM GOING THROUGH THE TABLE
2031,BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETISM,BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIS
2032,NOT VERY MUCH,OH NOT VERY MUCH
2033,IT WOULD NOT BE MAGNETISM THAT NO MORE LONG AND STUFF,IT WOULD NOT BE MAGNETISM THE NO MORE LONGER STEPS S
2034,MAGNETISM,MARAGNOTISM
2035,YEAH,EGE
2036,MAGNITUDE IT'S HARD FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS THICK,MAGNETITIS HARD FOR MAGNETISM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS THICK

2126,BECAUSE THEY DO,BECAUSE THEY DO
2127,OH NO AS WE,THOU KNO ASK
2128,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
2129,KNEW,NO
2130,YEAH THIS IS THE CAT CLOCK,IT IS THE CAT CLOCK
2131,THAT I DO NOT KNOW,THAT I DO NOT KNOW MOREVER
2132,NO,BOT IS NO SAID
2133,CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,BIRGATS AND B WELL FOR GET
2134,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARAEL SHIR
2135,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN VERY RADICAL WAY,I NOTICE THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RADICAL WAY
2136,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME,FAIR LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE DETAIL AND THAT IT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
2137,IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE THE THUNDER YEAH YEAH EXACTLY THUNDER HA LIKE THAT LIKE YEAH,IT'S BECAUSE IT IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED IN  STUFF WHY CONDOR YE YE EXACTLY KANDOR HA YE LIE WA WE LIKE YE
2138,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF,I THINK THAT AM BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
2139,I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT,I NOTICE THAT IS THAT IT IS A LOCUT BAH A VERY GOOD TOKET
2140,THEY ARE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND BUT IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED FOR ME AND,AIR COMPARED UMBY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AN FITS SENT U MOR COMPLICATED FORMAN BO L  BOK
2141,NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD,NOTICE THAT IT IS GLOWING THROUGH YOU AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RAD ECO
2142,IT IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND THE STUFF,SHE IS GOING ROUND AND IT IS A IN IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BUT BULBS WITH OR ONE DCELLIN WE DID THIS IN CLASS MSTAR
2143,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
2144,WHAT,WHAT
2145,DON'T,DANT
2146,THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THIS IS THA PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2147,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE AMOUNT IT'S GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL PODDING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE PODDING SOIL BECAUSE THE PODDING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE A THAN THE GRAVE THAN THE RAVEL BECUS BUT THE MOUNT ITS GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE ON STEP ON IT BUT THE PODDING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS
2148,GOOD,WHO GED
2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,ALL THE SOIL I DOESN'T COMPARE TO GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLDS FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN' T THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TO
2151,WE BEEN,DAY WEARY DORING
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,WE I OBSERVE THAT UM THE WATRK ITS DIRDY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL
2153,I SEE WATER IN SOIL,I SEE WATER AND SOIL
2154,YEAH,YR
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,YET CAUSE ON BECAUSE THE SOR THE SOIL KEEPS IT O THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CANNOT GROW IT CANNOT GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRINK DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP THE THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN LOOK SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,WELL THE SOILE ON ABSORBD MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLE LEADERS AND AND BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVE WILL LET FORTY WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT ATLEAST IS CLOSE TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANTED TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT
2158,GOT WET,E
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS AND PARTENC BECAUSE YOU CULD KNOW AND PEOPLE USE POTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING  SOO TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOES IT IT JUST LET TO GO DOWN TO THE CUT
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WE GRAP GRAPPLE AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO JOP WATERS
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,HE HAD JUST LIKE THAT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I ABSERBE THAT UM YE UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE ITS DART AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATRUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE IT AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST OM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTING SOIL ABSORS MORE THE GRAVEL DOES'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DAT
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,THE WAY IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER IS STILL GO IN BECAUSE THE WATER JLOWS THROUGH IN THER HOLES ALL OVER ON THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO TO BECAUSE THEREIS NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ANENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH OURSELFS SOME OF IT JIS GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THAM
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,IT DOESN'T GO TBROUG AND THE WATER'S JIRTY AND IT KEEPS HOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP IN A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER AND SOIL
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER
2168,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THEN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE PON SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T ILL JUST LET IT GO DOWN AN THE PLANT WOULD DIE
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,BE CAUSE IM SOMETIME THE THE PODDING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER  GROWS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTHEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AN THE THE PODDING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN IISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT
2171,BYE,BY
2172,YEP YEP,YEUP YUP
2173,WELL THE GRA THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOIL'S WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT U ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS IT ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUGH,WHILE THE GRAB TAIN THE SOIL THE SOILS WATER JAUSIT GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOILS KEEPIN IT ALL TE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH DRIPS ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOS THAT KEFIT
2174,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GE AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'D BE GREAT,WELL YOU CAN GO IN YOR CAPETER WILE YOU CAN'T GO AND COMP YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AN GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GOIN TO ROOM AND THET IM AND THEN GO GET WATER AN YUE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN YOU SUBMIT TO REAL AND THEN YOU COULD SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN'T GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'LL BE GREAT
2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER DRINKS WITH UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE ITS ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOWS DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF A WATER IN IT AN THE THE SOIL DOES IT THE SOIL KEEPS IT
2176,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESN'T IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T UM WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON 'EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,WHEN YOU POUR ON TO EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOES AT STICK STACE UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN IN THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T ON YOU POUR WATER ON EM THE IT GOES MUS MORE FASTER BECAUSE TIT HASE HOLD
2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THEREIS MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THER BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT IN THE I MEAN THE SOIL DIN'T LET THE WATER ON THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL
2178,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND RETURNED TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN
2179,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER,YAT JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER
2180,UHM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK,OM IT WILL JUST JEST BE BLACK
2181,UHM WELL UHM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE,UM WELL UM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE
2182,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE,ONYLIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BAL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT ITIS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUEUE
2183,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BALL,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE
2184,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE
2185,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT
2186,GOOD,GOOD
2187,SO WHEN THE WHITE UHM LIGHT SHINING ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,SO WHEN THE WHITE UM LIGT SHINES ON TO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW THAT COMES OUT
2188,WELL UHM THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL BECAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK IT JUST LOOKS BLACK,WELL UM THE LIGHT YACHT IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALCES THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE WERE BLACK JIS LOIKS BLACK
2189,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW IN THE BLUE BALLS NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWN BLUE
2190,BECAUSE THE GREEN LIGHT IS GREEN,AS THE GREEN LINE IS GR
2191,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY UHM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL THEY ARE YELLOW,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL TER WHITE AND WHEN THEY ARE MARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL IN THEIR YELLOW
2192,RED,RED
2193,UHM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,UM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONT THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2194,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL,ALL THE COLORS TURNED THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL
2195,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT AROUND,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE A THROWN
2196,WELL SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB,WELL SHOWN FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIT BALL
2197,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UHM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UHM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THE ROW HUM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK
2198,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGT
2199,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THAT COLOR TOO,HE HAD THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER WOULD THE OTHER OBJECTS RETURNED THE COLOR TO
2200,SO WHEN WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL UHM THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAME WITH THE BLUE SO ONLY YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BALL AND ONLY BLUE COMES THROUGH FOR THE BLUE BALL BLUE BALL,SO WHITE THE WHITE WHITE HITS THE YELLOW BALL R THE BOONBALL OM THE OTHER COF RINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAY  EOT TO THE YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YLLBOW AND WILL YO BE COMLETIN THE BLUBL BLOB OFF
2201,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UHM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT AS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT A MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE A LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT WITH THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
2202,COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH,E COLAR WALT SHINE THROUGH
2203,IT'S TURNING BLACK,IT'S TURNING BLACK
2204,SO UHM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT,SO UM TH YELLOW BALLIS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUEBOSS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGH
2205,IT ATTRACTS MORE STEEL WASHERS,IT ATTRACTS MORE STEAL OFF
2206,YOU CAN ADD WINDS OR SUBTRACT WINDS AND SEE IF THE ATTRACTS MORE STEEL WASHERS,YOU CAN ADD WINES OR SUBTRACT LINES AND SEE IF THE ATTRACTS MORE STEEL WASHERS
2207,STRONGER,STRONGER
2208,WRAPPING THE WIRE AROUND,RAPPING THE WIRE ROUND
2209,WHEN YOU ADD MORE WINDS AROUND THE STEEL RIVET IT IT ATTRACTS MORE STEEL WASHERS,WHEN YOU ADD MORE WINES AROUND THE STEEL RAVETTE IT IT IT ATTRACTS MORE STEEL WASHER
2210,WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER D CELL IT DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF WASHERS PICKED UP,WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER DESAIL IT DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF WASHERS P
2211,THE STRENGTH RELATES OF THE NUMBER OF WASHERS PICKED UP IS YOU IF YOU THE MORE WINDS THAT YOU ADD THE MORE WASHERS THE ELECTROMAGNET PICKS UP,THE STRENGTH T E RELATES OF THE NUMBER OF WASHES PICKED UP IS YOU IF YOU THE MORE WINES THAT YOU ADD THE MORE WASHERS TO THE ELECTROMAGNET PICKS
2212,THAT IT DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF WASHERS PICKED UP,THAT IT DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF WASHERS PICKED UP
2213,ELECTROMAGNETS ARE MAGNETISM OR MAGNETS WITH ELECTRICITY IN THEM,TRUMET ELECTROMAGNETS ARE MAGNETISM OR MAGNETS WITH ELECTRICITY AN
2214,I DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE WINDS YOU ADD AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE STEEL WASHERS THE ELECTROMAGNET ATTRACTS,I HAVE RECOVERED THAT THE MORE WINES YOU ADD AROUND THE STEEL RAVETTE THE MORE WATH STEEL WASPERS THE ELECTROMAGNET ATTRACTS
2215,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2216,MANY WASHERS THERE HOW MANY WASHERS THERE ARE,MANY WASHERS THERE ARE HOW MANY WASHERS THERE ARE
2217,I DON'T KNOW THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER WHEN YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WINDS AND IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS,I DON'T KNOW THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER WHEN YOU INCREASE A NUMBER OF WINES AND A PICKS UP MORE STILL WASER
2218,THE STRENGTH OF THE THE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET IT'S STRONGER AND THEN IT THE MORE WINDS AROUND IT MAKES IT STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS,THE STRENGTH OF THE STEAT OF THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER AND THEN IT THE MORE WINES AROUND IT MAKES IT STRONGER AND THEN IT PICKS UP MORE STEEL WASHERS
2219,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN EER BE
2220,I NOTICED THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET TURNS ON AND ATTRACTS THE WASHERS,I NOTICED THAT THE ELECTROL MAGNET TURNS ON AND ATTRACKS THE WATER
2221,BY SHOWING A GRAPH,BUT SHOWING THE GRASS
2222,I'M DONE,I'M DONE
2223,THAT'S ALL I KNOW,THAT'S ALL I KNOW
2224,THAT SHOWS WHAT THE BAR GRAPH IS AND HOW MANY THERE ARE AND WHAT IT IS,THAT SHOWS WHAT THE BARGRAPH IS IN HOW MANY THERE ARE AND WHAT IT IS
2225,THAT'S ALL I KNOW,THAT'S ALL I KNOW
2226,BECAUSE IT JUST DOES,BECASAGES CASE
2227,THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER,THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTROMAGNET GET STRONGER
2228,IT ATTRACTS MORE STEEL WASHERS,IT ATTRACTS MORE TEEL WASHER
2229,I NOTICED THAT THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES WHEN THERE'S TWO D CELLS,I NOTICE THAT THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES WHEN THEREIS TWO DECEILS
2230,IT DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF THE WASHERS PICKED UP,IT DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF WASHERS PICKED UP
2231,THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES WITH THE AS THE NUMBER OF WINDS INCREASES,THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES WITH THEM AS A NUMBER OF WINES INCREASES
2232,THIRTEEN,THIRTEEN
2233,IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF,INCREASES THE NUMBER OF WA
2234,ON ONE SIDE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAPH IT SHOWS HOW MANY THERE ARE AND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IT SHOWS WHAT THEY ARE AND ON THE TOP OF THE GRAPH IT SHOWS WHAT THE GRAPH IS ABOUT,ON ONE SIDE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GARAFFH IT SHOWS HOW MANY THERE ARE AND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAFFH IT SHOWS WHAT THEY ARE AND ON THE TOP OF THE GRAFFH IT SHOWS WHAT THE GRAFH IS ABOUT
2235,WRAP IT AROUND MORE TIMES,RAPID AROUND MORE TIMES

2239,THIS PLANT HAD WATER UHM CARBON DIOXIDE BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE SUNLIGHT THAT'S WHY IT'S YELLOW SO IT CAN'T CREATE CHLOROPHYLL,THIS PLANT HAD WATER ON CARBON DIOXIDE BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE SOME WHITE THAT'S WHY ITS YALLOW SO CAN'T CRAVE CORF
2240,UH THE CHLOROPHYLL IS THE CHLOROPHYLL'S NOT ON THAT PLANT BECAUSE IT'S YELLOW AND CHLOROPHYLL'S GREEN SO IT MAKES THE PLANT GREEN AND SO THAT ONE DIDN'T PROBABLY HAVE LIKE SUNLIGHT OR WATER OR C O TWO OR SOMETHING AND THAT ONE HAD ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT MAKE CAN MAKE CHLOROPHYLL,IT A THE COR FIELS IS A THE CORP FIELDS NOT ON THAT PLANT CAUSE ITS YELLOW IN COR FIELDS GREEN SO MAKES THE PLANT GREEN AND SO THAT ONE DIDN'T PROBABLY HAVE LIKE SUNLIGHT OR WATER OR SEE O TOO OR SOMETHING IN THAT ONE HAD ALL THOSE THINGS CAUSE IT MAKE CAN MAKE COR FAIL

2375,A D CELL BATTERY TWO WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,A DESO BATRY TWO IRES AND A LIGHT
2376,THEY'RE ABOUT LIGHT,THERE ABOUT ALL RIGHT
2377,IT MEANS LIKE IT RECEIVES IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY OF THE BATTERY THAT CONNECTS TO THE WIRES WHICH RECEIVES THE ENERGY TO THE BULB,IT MEANS LIKE IT WASHEEP IT GETS THE ELECISWY O THE ENERGY OF THE BATTERY THAT CONNECTS THE LAW WIRS WHICH ASHEEPS THE ENERGY TO THE BOB
2378,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAD NO BATTERY IT WOULDN'T REALLY LIGHT CAUSE THE THE D CELL BATTERY HAS ENERGY STORED INSIDE,TOH IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAD NO BATTERY IT WOULDN'T REALLY LIGKT ECAUSE THE BAT THE DESAIL BATTERY HAS ENERGY STORED INSIDE
2379,OKAY,OKE
2380,IT'S GOING TOWARDS THE FILAMENT WHICH MAKES IT WHICH MAKES IT GIVE LIGHT AND THEN YEAH,IT'S GOING TOWARDS R FILAMENT WHICH MAKES IT LUCK WHICH MAKES IT GIVE LIGHT AND THEN EA
2381,THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THEN TEVED ISIDE
2382,WHEN BOTH OF THEM ARE AT THE BOTTOM IT DOESN'T WORK,WEN BU U THE BO AT THE BOTTOM AT DOESN'T WORK
2383,WHEN I CLICKED ON IT IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND IT COMES OUT THE NEGATIVE,ER WHEN I CRICKD ON IT OM THE IT'S GOING TO CHEW THE POSITIVE AND IT COMBS OUT THE NEGATIVE
2384,LEARNING ABOUT LIKE LIKE LIKE ELECTRICITY,BURNING ABOUT LIKE TERLIKE C ALE LIKE ELECTRICITY
2385,IT GOES THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS THE NEGATIVE,IT GOS OS E WAY TOWARDS THE NEGATIVE
2386,ELECTRICITY,ELA
2387,WELL SINCE THE WIRES CONNECT IT CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND AND THE LITTLE WIRES INSIDE MAKE THE LIGHT AND THEN IT GETS HOT BUT IT STARTS TO BURN AND THEN IT DOESN'T BURN BUT IT STARTS TO GET HOT AND THEN IT GIVES OUT LIGHT,WELL SINCE THE WIRES CONNECTIT CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB THE THE LIGHT BULL RECEIVE THE ENERGY AND AND THERE LITTLE WIRES INSIDE MAKES THE LIGHT AND THEN IT GETS HOT BUT IT STARTS TO BURN AND THEN IT DOESN'T BURN BUT ET STARTS TO GET HOT AND THEN IT GIVES OT LIGHT
2388,I DON'T KNOW,OH I DON'T KNOW
2389,THE POSITIVE,NOR PARTOTI
2390,CAUSE ONE OF THEM IS NOT I MEAN THE CIRCUIT,CAUSE ONE OF THEM IS NOT PACE I MEAN THE CIRCUIT
2391,NO,MA
2392,A D CELL BATTERY A A D CELL BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A AND TWO WIRES BASICALLY AND IT HELPS YOU TURN ON THE BULB THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRE,BUT DYE SAIL BATTERY A SPOON A DESAI BATTERY A LIGHT BOB AND A AND TWO WIRES BASICLLYP AND IT HELPED SHE OULD TURN ON THE BOB THE DISAI BATTERY IN THE WIRE
2393,IT FLOWS LIKE STRAIGHT IT IT IT GOES FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH IS THE RECEIVER,IT FLOWS LIKE STRAY IT IT IT GOTS FROM THER POSITIVE SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE IN IT AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHTBOLB WHICH IS A RECEIVED
2394,IT GOES THE OTHER WAY,THE'V GORSO ON THE WAY
2395,THE ENERGY WAS ELECTRICITY,THE ENRGY OS A ELECTRICITY
2396,THE WIRES ARE LETTING THE,THO WHY S ARE WETTING THE ELITT
2397,THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTED,THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTE AH
2398,IT FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN INTO THE NEGATIVE,IT FROWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN INTO THE NEGAT
2399,THAT THE THE THAT THE WIRE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE IS IS TOUCHING THE IS TOUCHING THE WHAT'S IT CALLED IT'S TOUCHING THE BASE NO NO NO I MEAN THE,THA THA THE TAT THE WIRE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE IS IS TOUHING THE IS TOUCHING THE COTICO ITS TOUCHING THE BASE NON NO I MEAN TH
2400,THE ELECTRICITY OF THE THE ENERGY OF THE BATTERY,THEARE LA THREE OTHERB THE ENERGY OF THE BATTERY
2401,THEY HELP TURN ON THE BULB THEY THEY HAVE THE ENERGY IN THEM WHICH IF YOU CONNECT BOTH OF THE WIRES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN YOU CONNECT THE OTHER WIRE TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU YOU MAKE ONE WIRE TOUCH THE BASE AND ONE WIRE TOUCH THE CIRCUIT,AR Y HELP HER ON THE BOLB TAT THEY HAVE THE ENERGY IN THEM WHICH IF YOU CONNECT BOTH OF THE WIRES TOO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE AND THEN YOU CONNECT TE OTHER WIRES TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU YOU MAKE ONE WIRE TOUCH O BASE AND ONE WIRE TOUCH SAW A CIRCET
2402,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,CUT HE THREW OUT AGAIN
2403,THAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES TOUCHES THE THE CIRCUIT AND THEN IT GOES ONTO THE TOP WHICH IS THE FILAMENT AND THEN COMES RIGHT BACK OUT AND GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE OF THE D CELL,THAT THE NAGUTIVE TRIED GIRS TATCIS TO THE SIRCEAT AND THEN IT GOES ON TO THE TOP WHICH IS THE FRWINT AND THEN COMES RIGHT BACK OUT AND GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THEOF THE DECAIL
2404,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR,THE ELECELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE MOTOR
2405,IF THERE'S ENOUGH LIGHT YEAH BUT REALLY NOT THERE'S CHANCES OF YEAH BUT SOMETIMES,OR IT ITO NOT BIT YE BUT MAYLY NOT THERE'S CHANCES OF Y BUT SOMETIMES
2406,THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED THE LITTLE LIKE THINGY IS CLOSED SO IT'S IT'S LETTING THE ENERGY GO INTO THE WIRES BUT IF IT'S UP IT WON'T,THE CIRKET IS CLOSE FOR LITTLE LIKE SINGYS CRUMBS SO IS IT'S OM IT'S LETTING THE ENERGY GO INTO THE WIRES BUT IF IT'S AP IT W
2407,THE HAS TO BE CLOSED,LORD POT US TO BE CLOSED
2408,THAT IT IS OPEN AND THE AND IT'S AND THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH SO IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT CIRCUIT SO THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH,THERE IT IS OPEN AND THE AND ITS AND THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH SO IT HAS TO BE A CLOSE CIRCUIT CIRCUITS OBOUT ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH
2409,THAT WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT IS THE LITTLE FLAG THING IS SPINNING AND WHEN IT'S OPEN IT IS NOT SO THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING,THER ON ICOST IT IS THE A LITTLE FLAGGY SING IS SPINNING AND WHEN IT'S OPEN IT IS NOT ASHO THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT BLOWING
2410,IT STARTS GOING,ISIGESCARLINHA
2411,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN THE AND THEN IT IS AND THEN AND THEN THE ENERGY'S GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE WIRE AND THEN IT'S GOING TO THE MOTOR AND THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,OH THE TO WARDS ARE CONNECTED TO THE DESOIL BATTERY AND THEN THE AND HEN IT IS AND IN THE IT AND THEN THE ENERGYIS GOING TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE WIRE AND THEN IT'S GOING TOH THE MOTOR AND THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE S
2412,I DON'T KNOW OH THE,OM AND NA ATHER M
2413,THE THE SOLAR PANEL IS THE SOLAR PANEL IS LIKE IS LIT SO THEN IT HAS SUNLIGHT AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE MOTORS AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE WITHOUT LIGHT IT WOULDN'T REALLY RUN,THE SOUL  SAPORTE PAN WHAT IT IS THE SALA PANEL IS LIFE IS LIT WA SOSAN IT HAS SON LIGHT AND THEN IT'S CONNECTED TIH A MOTIVS SO THE MOTOR IS RUNNING CAUSE WAS OUT WY IT WOULD N'T REALLY RUN
2414,THAT IT PRODUCES LIGHT WITHOUT LIKE ELECTRIC SWITCHES AND IT'S SAFER TO USE BUT,THAT IT PRODUCES LI WITHOUT LIKE ELECTRIC TESE AND IT'S SAFER TO USE BUT
2415,GOOD,GOOD
2416,THEY'RE ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY TOO THEY THEY ALSO HELP IT HELP SOMETHING RUN,THEY ARE ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY TOL THEY OM THEY ALL SO HELP IT HELP SOMETHING RUN
2417,IT JUST STAYS STILL THERE,I PES SA SILTER
2418,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ELECTROMAGNETISM,BEFIN WORKING WAS ELECTROMAG
2419,MAGNIFICENT HOW ARE YOU,NIPLICENT HOW ARE YOU
2420,THE CIRCUIT HAS THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED,O TURK IT AT THE SURK IT HAS TO BE CLOSED
2421,IT REALLY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING IT WOULDN'T MAKE IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE LIGHTING THE MOTOR,IT REALLY WOULDN'T GO ANYTHING IT WOULDN'T MAKE IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE LIGHTING THE WATER
2422,IT THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO HAVE LIGHT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN SO THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE SOLAR CELL AND THE MOTOR,O IT THE SOLLER SHELL HAS TO HAVE PLIT IN LOTER TOO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN SO THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE SOLAR CELL AND THE  MOT
2423,THE MOTOR IS SPINNING,NER IPINNING
2424,WHEN I CLICK THE SUN IT IT GOES TO THE SOLAR CELL AND IT MAKES THE MOTOR LIGHT BUT WHEN IT'S CLOUDY IT REALLY DOESN'T GET ANY LIGHT AND THE MOTOR DOESN'T RUN,WHEN I CRECT THE SUN IT IT COS TO THE SOLAR SHELL AND IT MAKES THEM LIGHT BUT WHEN ITS CLAWRY IT REALLY DOESN'T GET ANY LIGHT IN THE MOTOR DOESN'T IT RUN
2425,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL AND THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR SO THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND MAKES IT AND MAKES IT RUN MAKES THE MOTOR RUN,WOR THE TWO AR CONNECTED WITH THE DECAIL AND THE TWO ARS ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR SO THE ENERGY CLOSE THROUGH THE WATRES AND MAKES A AND MAKES IT RUN MAKES THEM A MOTOR RUN
2426,IT'S ABOUT TURNING ON THE MOTOR,A EITS ABOUT TURNING ON THE MOTOR
2427,THE THE MOTOR IS NOT SPINNING,THE THE MOTOR IS NOT SPINNING
2428,IT DOESN'T SPIN,IT DOESN'T SPIN
2429,IT IS CLOSED,IT IS CLOS

2431,YOU TOO MARNEY SEE YA AND WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME BY THE WAY,YOU TOO MARN SEE YO AND WHAT'S YOUR LAST NIGT BY THE WA
2432,THAT IT PICKS UP THE MINI WASHERS AND WHEN IT'S NOT OPEN I MEAN WHEN IT'S NOT CLOSED IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T THE RIVET DOESN'T PICK UP THE MINI STEEL WASHERS,THERE IT IT PICKS UP O MANY WASHERS AND WHEN IT NAR OPEN I MEAN WHEN THE STACK CLOSED IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN' THE RIBBET DOESN'T PICK UP THOSE MANY SAL WASHERS
2433,THAT EVERYTHING'S CONNECTED,THER AVYTHINGS CONNECTED
2434,YOU COULD GET TWO BATTERIES,YOU CAN'T GET TWO FETTERIES
2435,IT PICKS UP MORE WASHERS,IT PICKS UP MORE WASHERS
2436,THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY,THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY
2437,THE WIRE WRAPS UM ON THE BOTTOM AND THE WASHERS ON THE SIDE A HUNDRED WRAPS WITH TWO D CELLS EQUALS THIRTY UM WASHERS AND ONE D CELL WITH A HUNDRED WRAPS EQUALS THIRTY UM WASHERS AND ONE D CELL WITH A HUNDRED WRAPS EQUALS FIFTEEN THE DIFFERENCE IS FIFTEEN,FHE WIE WRAPS UMON THE BOTTOM AND WASHERS ON THE SIDE A HUNDRED WRAPS WITH TO DECELLS EQUALS THIRTY  UN WASHERS AND ONE DE SON WITH A HUNDRED RAPS EQUAL FIFTEEN THE DIFFERENCE IS FIFTEEN

2448,THAT IS ELECTRICITY,THE IS ELECTRICITY
2449,THAT THE FIRST ONE TO UM LIGHT BULBS ARE DIMMER CAUSE IT ONLY AS ONE ENERGY SOURCE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS IS BRIGHTER CAUSE IT HAS TWO ENERGY SOURCES,THAT THE FIRST ONE THE LONG LIGHTPOPES ARE DIMECAUSE IT ONLY HAS ONE ENERGY SOURCE AND THE OTHER ONE E HAS IS PRIDER CREKD I TOINHER GREESE PORSE
2450,GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNI,GOOD HOW ARE YOU JENE
2451,THAT WITH TWO D CELLS HAS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE ONE WITH ONE,THE ONE OF TWO DESOULS HAS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE ONE WITH ONE
2452,IT'LL GET DIM THEY WON'T IT WON'T BE AS BRIGHT,WHEY'LL GET DIM THE WOM IT WULLD BE ASRIGHT
2453,UM THAT IT COULD GIVE OUT LIGHT AND HEAT,O THAT IT COULD GIVE A FLIGHT AND HEAT
2454,IT LETS IT GET SINCE UM THE THE THE ENERGY MAKES IT HOT IT UM,HE LETS I GIETSENCE COM THE LIC THOUGH THE ENERGY MAKE  HARD I EM
2455,OR WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS FLIPPED TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT UM FLOWS BUT WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS WITH THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT DOESN'T FLOW,O WHEN THE BOSSITIVE SAID IS WITH THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT ON IT FLOS BUT WHEN THE NEGATIVE SID IS WAS THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT DOESN'T FLOW
2456,UM I DON'T KNOW,E  E OT A MOMENT
2457,ENERGY HAS TO RUN THROUGH THE WIRE,ENERGY HAS THRWN TO THE WA
2458,IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BULBS AND THE D CELL,IT IS FALLING THROUGH THE FIRES ANDS ROB BOKS IN THE DESAI
2459,THE LIGHT BULB MIGHT BE BROKEN UH CAUSE ONE IS UPSIDE DOWN AND ONE IS RIGHT SIDE UP,AO I THOUGT MY PEOPLE OF IN OH COS ONE IS UPSIDE DOWN AT ONE IS RIGHT SIDE U

2648,UM WELL YOU'D NEED TO CONNECT THE SHINY THING TO THAT LITTLE SWITCH OR CONNECT THE SWITCH ITSELF TO THAT WIRE HOLDER,ALM WILL YOU NEED TE CONNEXT EITHER SHINY THING TO THAT LITTLE SWITCH OR CONNECT THIS WICK ITSELF TO THAT WHILE HOLD IT
2649,NO BECAUSE THE METAL IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER PIECE OF THE METAL,NO BECAUSE THE METAL IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER PIECE IN THE MET
2650,WELL THE WAY WE DID IT TO UM SEE WHICH WAS CONDUCTORS AND UM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER WORD BUT THERE A SWITCH THING WE WOULD CONNECT THE CONDUC THE UM OBJECT TO THE SWITCH,WA THE WAY WE DID IT THE COMSY OF WOODCORDS CONDUCTORS AND OM I CAN THE OTHER WORD BUT THE WAS WHIH THING WE WOULD CONNECT THE CONDUCT THI OM OBJECT TO THE SWHICH
2651,HELLO,LAW F
2652,THE UM ELECTRICITY WELL THE MOTOR JUST SWITCHED ITS DIRECTION,THEM LEC TO SEE WHILE THE MOTOR JESSWITCHED ITS DIRECTION
2653,YES BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET THROUGH THE SWITCH SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,YES BECAUSE ELECTRICITY CAN GET THROUGH THE SWITCH SO IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT
2654,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO WORK BUT UM BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY UM COMES BACK INTO THE PO POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN COMES BACK THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER WORK,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE FREIT TO BE ABLE TO WORK BUT UM BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY UM COMES BACK INTO THE POHOSITIVE SIDE AND THEN COMES BACK THOUH THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVE ER WORK
2655,UM WELL THIS ONE IS A SWITCH A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY THE OTHER ONE WASN'T BECAUSE IT HAS THIS IT HAS AN OPEN SWITCH AND THEN WI AND THEN THERE'S A BATTERY AND THEN THERE'S A LIGHT BULB,WELL THIS WON IS A SWITCH A LIGPTBULP AND A BATTERY THE OTHER ONE WASN'T BECAUSE HAS THI IT HAS AN OPEN SWITCH AND THEN WITH AND THEN THERE'S A BATTERY AND THEN THERE'S A LIGPTBULP
2656,WELL BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTED BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR,WELL BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTED BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR
2657,WELL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING FIRST YOU COULD DRAW IT WITH A SCHEMATIC UM DIAGRAM AND THEN YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE IT INSTEAD OF JUST WORKING WITH ONLY THE CIRCUITS AND STUFF,WELL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING HEEFFORTS YOU COULD DRAW IT WITH A SCHEMATIC A DIAGRAM AND THEN YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE IT ANDSTAAVE JUST WORKING WITH OLD NAME THE CIRCUITS AND STUFF
2658,YES,YES
2659,IT WELL THE SWITCH WILL IF IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT A CLOSED SWI A CLOSED SWITCH IT WILL UM IT WILL LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT'S CLOSED AND IT HAS METAL THAT WILL LET ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH IT AND WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT WILL IT DOESN'T HAVE THE METAL T UM CLOSED SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GET THROUGH,IT WELL THE WITCH WILL IF IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT A CLOSE SA CLOSE WITCH IT WILL UM IT WILL LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE AND IT HAS A METL THAT WILL LET ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH IT AND WHENC'E AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT WILL IT DOESN'T HAVE THE METAL I'M CLOSE SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GET THROUGH
2660,WELL IT IT CAN SHOW YOU LIKE HOW THINGS ARE POSITIONED BUT YOU JUST NEED LIKE A KEY TO KNOW WHAT THINGS ARE SO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE LIKE A DIAGRAM OR ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T REALLY TELL WHERE THE THINGS WERE,WELL IT IT CAN SHOW YOU LIKE HOW THINGS ARE POSITIONED BUT YOU JUST NEED LIKE A KEY TO KNOW WHAT THINGS ARE SO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE LIKE A DIAGRAM OR ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T REALLY TELL WHERE THE THINGS WERE
2661,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND HOW IT GETS TO UM ELEN ELECTRICITY RECEIVER TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER OR THE THING THAT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY WORK,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND HOW IT GETS TO UM OUTEN ELECTRICITY RECEIVER TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER OR THE THING THAT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY WORK
2662,BECAUSE THE SHORT LINE AND THE LONG LINE ARE THE BATTERY AND THEN THE STRAIGHT LINES ARE THE WIRES AND THE CIRCLE WITH THE UM CURLY Q THING IS A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE TWO DOTS ARE THE SWITCH,BECAUSE THE SHORT LINEED A LONG LINE ARE THE BATTERY AND THEN THE STRAIGHT LINES ARE THE WIRES AND THE CIRCLE WITH THE UM CURLY CUTHING IS A LIT BULB AND THEN THE TWO DOTS ARE THE SWITCH
2663,THAT,THAT
2664,A COMPLETE CIRCUIT IS WHEN THERE IS UM WIRE THAT CAN GET AROUND FROM THE BATTERY TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND BACK AGAIN,COMPLETE CIRCUIT IS WHEN THERE IS UM WIRE THAT CAN'T GET AROUND FROM THE BATTERY TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND BACK AGAIN
2665,YOU CAN MOVE THE SWITCH SO THAT IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE SO IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR RUN AND IT WILL LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH,OU CAN MOVE THE SWITCH SO THAT IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE SO IT WILL MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND IT WILL LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH
2666,YES IT IS,YES AF ES
2667,WELL A CLOSED CIRCUIT IS WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED SO IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT,WELL A CLOSE CIRCUIT AS WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED SO IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT
2668,YES I DO,YES I DARE
2669,UM THERE'S AN OPEN SWITCH AN OPEN SWITCH THAT SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING,M THERE IS AN OPEN WHITCH AN OPEN SWITCH THAT  SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
2670,IT IS A BATTERY AND A MOTOR BECAUSE THE BATTERY SENSOR THE S THE LONG LINE AND THE SHORT LINE AND IT HAS THE WIRES THE WIRES AND THEN IT HAS THE MOTOR UM AND IT HAS THE MOTOR,IT IS A BATTERY AND A MOTOR BECAUSE THE BATTERY SIGNS THERE THE LONG LINE AND THE SHORT LINE AND IT HAS THE WIRES THE WIRES AND THEN IT HAS THE MOTOR UM AND IT HAS THE MOTOR
2671,IT TRAVELS THROUGH A CIRCUIT AND IT AND THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GETS TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND THEN IT COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE SIDE AND THEN IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING,IT TRAVELS THROUGH A CIRCUIT AND IT AND THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GETS TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND THEN IT COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE HIDE AND THEN IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING
2672,IT IS A PICTURE OF A BATTERY AND IT HAS A CIRCUIT THAT'S GE AND THERE'S A SWITCH THEN IT'S GETTING INTO A LIGHT BULB,IT IS A PICTURE OF A BATTERY AND IT HAS A CIRCUIT THAT'S AND THERE'S A SWITCH THEN IT'S GETTING INTAIL LIGHTBOE
2673,THAT THE WIRES ARE IN A CIRCULAR POSITION AND GETTING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND THEN BACK AGAIN,THAT THE WIRES ARE IN A CIRCULAR POSITIAN AND GETTING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND THEN BACK AGAIN
2674,I'VE USED A SWITCH SO THAT YOU CAN TURN SO THAT YOU CAN LET THE ELECTRICITY GO TH SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE MOTOR STOP OR GO ON AND THE SAME WITH A LIGHT BULB MAKE THE LIGHT BULB GO OFF OR GO ON,AV USED A WITCH SO THAT YOU CAN TURN SO THAT YOU CAN LET THE ELECTROCITECRET SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE TOME MOTOR STOP OR GO ON AN THE SAME WAT THE LIGHTBULB MAKE THE LIGHT BULB GO OFF OR GO ON
2675,WELL UM WE'RE STUDYING HOW MAGNETS REACT TO EACH OTHER AND HOW THEY ATTRACT CERTAIN THINGS,BEM WERE STEADING HOW MAGNATS WACK TO EACH OTHER AND HOW THEY ATTRACT CERTAIN THING
2676,NO,NOUG
2677,BECAUSE IT E DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT,IT ISN'T HALF HOUR  OR SIND YELO
2678,REPELS FROM THE OTHER MAGNET AND WILL NOT LET THEM COME NEAR AND THE TWO ON THE TOP ARE ATTRACTED ALSO,PELLS FROM THE OTHER MAGNET AND WILL NOT LET THEM COME ERE AND THEY TURON THE TOP ARE TRACTADLES
2679,GOOD,GOD
2680,LE IS MADE OUT OF IRON,ITS SAKE OUT OF COSPIL ION
2681,NO THEY'RE NOT,NABERI
2682,AND,OR
2683,NEGATIVE MAGNET WHICH MEANS THAT IT,MAGATIC MAGLAR WIT WORLE FAT
2684,THE TWO MAGNETS ON THE BOTTOM ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER SO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER THE ONE THE MAGNET IN THE MIDDLE IS S,TWO MAGNETS ON THE BOTTOM ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHERS HO THEYAR STICKING TOGETHER THE ONE'S THE MAGNET IN THE MIDDLE O IS
2685,IT SHOWS A MAGNET PICKING UP THE METALS THAT IT'S THAT IT IS ATTRACTED TO,AN SHOWS A MAGNET PICKING UP WIT THEN S METALS THAT IT THAT IT IS ATTRACTED
2686,IRON AND STEEL,IRON AND STEER
2687,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY,HE HAD BEEN STUBDLING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
2688,I'M TRYING TO THINK,OU TO
2689,BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IF THERE'S TWO THAT GIVES UP GIVES OFF A LOT MORE ENERGY SO,BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IF THERE'S TOO THAT GIVES UP GIVES OFF A LOT MORE ENERGY
2690,MMM HMM YES,HAMPLETH AFTER YOUTH ITYES
2691,W WE DIDN'T QU WE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH TIME WE WERE TRYING MANY MANY THINGS AND THEY JUST WEREN'T RIGHT SO WE R RAN OUT OF TIME,WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH TIME WE WERE TRYING MANY MANY THINGS AND THEY JUST WEREN'T BRIGHT SO WE ANOUF TI
2692,A SERIES,A SERIES
2693,UM WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE WIR OR TWO OF THE LIGHT BULBS AND YOU CONNECT THEM WITH ONE WIRE OR TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT'S DIMMER YES YES WE DID,UM WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE WI OR TWO THE LIPE BUBS AND YOU CONNECT THEM WITH ONE WIRE OR TWO HOURS TOGETHER IT'S DIMMER YES YES WE DID
2694,A D CELL AND UM IT'S A ENERGY SOURCE YES MMM HMM,A DESAL AND SI'M IT'S A ENERGY SOURECE YES
2695,THREE,
2696,ONE,ONE
2697,OKAY YES UM TODAY WE WERE WORKING ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO WIRES AND YOU CONNECT IT TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO OTHER WIRES AND YOU CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER WIRE SO IT HA GIVES YES TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND IT GIVES OFF A BRIGHTER LIGHT,YES UM TO DAY WE ERE WORKING ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AN THE SERY CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO WIRES THAN YOU CONNECT IT TO ONE LIGHT BALB AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO OTHER WIRES THAN YOU CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER WIRE SO IT HAD GIVES YES TO ANOTHER LITBALB AND IT GIVES OFF A BRIGHTER LIGHT
2698,MMM NOPE WE DID CONDUCTORS CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT UM ENERGY WILL GO THROUGH,NO WE DID CONDUCTORS CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT I'M ENERGEBICAL THROUGH
2699,THE LIGHT GOT VERY DIM,THE LIGHT GOT VERY DIM
2700,YES,YES
2701,A WIRE,A WIRE
2702,IT HAS TO IT HAS TO GO IN A CIRCLE FOR IT TO ACTUALLY GO OFF YES UH CONNECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IF LIKE IF THAT ONE DIDN'T CONNECT TO THAT ONE IT WOULD NOT GIVE OFF ENERGY BECAUSE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'LL GO UP INTO THIS ONE AND LIGHT IT UP AND THEN IT'LL GO OVER TO THIS ONE LIGHT UP AND IF THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THIS ONE JUST WOULDN'T LIGHT IT WOULD BE ALL BY NO,IT HAS TO G ETT INTRU IT HAS TO GO AT A CIRCLE FOR IT  ACTUALLYGO OFF YES A CONNECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IF LIKE IF THAT ONE DIDN'T CONNECTO THAT ONE IT WOULD NOT GIVE OFF ENERGY BBECAUSE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'LL GO UP INTO THIS ON LIGHTED UP AND T GO OVER TO THIS ONE LIGHT UMU AND IF THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THIS ONE JUST WOULDNT LIGHT IT WOULD BE ALL GINT LECTROUSLY RIGHT NO
2703,WELL WHAT'S GOING IS THIS IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP AND THAT IS GIVING OFF THE D CELL IS THE SAME ONE IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE SO IT MAKES IT LIGHT,WELL WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS IS GIVING OFF ENERGY THIS ONE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP AND THAT IS GIVING UP THE DESAIL IS THE SAME ONE SKING OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE SO MAKE THEM LIGHT
2704,IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY WERE ALL THE SAME LIGHT L YES YES,IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY WERE ALL THE SAME LIGHT E RELY SI EYES YES
2705,I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE THAT,I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE THAT
2706,YEAH,YE
2707,UH NOT REALLY,AH N NOT REALLY
2708,WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS THAT WHAT WE TRIED DID NOT WORK CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD WORK THAT THAT WOULD WORK BUT IT DIDN'T CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THOSE HAD TO CONNECT BUT NOW THAT I'M LOOKING BACK ON WHAT I DID I THINK IT DOES NEED TO CONNECT,WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS THAT WHAT WE TRIED DIDN'T NOT WORK CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD WORK THAT THAT WOULD WORK BUT IT DIDN'T CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THOSE HAD TO CONNECT BUT NOW THAT I'M LOOKING BACK ON WHAT I DID I THINK IT DOESN'T
2709,TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE MISS DUNN TOLD US THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE THIS,TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE MISS DUNTOLD US THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE THIS
2710,NO YES WE HAVE MMM HMM,NO SS OH GUESS WE HAVE
2711,NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED THAT THAT MEANS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY SO YES,NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED THAT THAT MEANS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR WON'T FLOW THAT WAY YES
2712,YES,YES
2713,AND THOSE ARE TH N N AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A WIRE THAT WENT THROUGH ONE OF THE METAL THINGS AND THEN IT WOULD GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE THE TWO WIRES AND WE WERE TRYING TO OUT THEM ONTO THE BATTERY SO IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS SO IT WOULD BE BRIGHTER,AND THOSE O THE AND THEN THEREOULD BE A WIRE THAT WENT THROUGH ONE OF THE METAL THINGS AND THEN IT WOULD GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE THE TWO WIRES AND E WERE TRYING TO PUT THEM ON TO THE BATTERY SO IT UL LOOK LIKE THIS SO T WOULD BE BRIGHTER
2714,WE QU DIDN'T QUITE FIGURE IT OUT YET WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO TWO LIGHT BULBS,WE DIDN'T QUITE FIGURE IT OUT YET WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO CHU LIE BOBS
2715,OKAY,AUQUET
2716,BECAUSE THE BATTERY WOULD STILL GIVE OFF ENERGY AND IT WON'T AFFECT THAT ONE,BECAUSE THE BATTERY WAS TO GIVE OFF ENERGY AND IT WON'T AFFECT THAT ONE
2717,YES,GUESS
2718,NOTHING,LAUGHING
2719,WE WERE TRYING TO CREATE A CIRCUIT MMM HMM A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE PRETTY MUCH IT'S WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH ONE SIDE THE BATTERY GOES TO SOMETHING MAKES IT LIGHT UP OR RUN AND THEN GOES AGAIN THROUGH AND THEN IT'LL JUST MAKE A CIRCLE CIRCUIT YES NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS CAUSE IT CAN GO EITHER WAY OR IT CAN GO BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME,WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A CIRCUIT A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE PRETTY MUCH IT'S WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY GOES TO SOMETHING MAKES IT LIGHT UP OR RUN AND THEN GOES AGAIN THROUGH AND THEN LL JUST MAKE A CIRCLE CIRCUINYES NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS ECAUSE IT CAN GO EITHER WAY OR CAN GO BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME
2720,WELL BECAUSE IT WAS SHARING OFF THE SAME UM WIRES AND THE WIRE COULDN'T N THE BATTERY COULDN'T PULL OFF ENOUGH ENERGY TO G THE WIRE TO GIVE TO THE BATTERIES BUT WHEN IT'S SEPARATE IT GIVES OFF MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE AND NOT OFF THE ONE,WELL BECAUSE IT WAS SHARING OFF THE SAME A WIRES AND THE WIRE COULDN'T THE BATTERY COULDN PULL OFF ENOUGH ENERGY TO THE WIRE TO GIVE TO THE BATTERIES BUT WHEN IT'S SEPARATE IT GIVES OFF MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE AND NOT OFF THE ONE
2721,HAS TO GO BACK TO THE ENERGY SOURCE,HAS TO GO BACK TO THE ENERGY SOURCE
2722,ONE,WHY
2723,OKAY,HM
2724,OKAY,I DO
2725,YES,YERS
2726,YEAH,
2727,THEY DON'T WORK,DHEY DON'T FOR
2728,WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES EACH BATTERY WILL BE A SOURCE FOR THE LIGHT BULB FOR EACH LIGHT BULB AND IT'LL BE BRIGHTER,WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES EACH BATTERY WILL BE A SOURCE FOR THE LIOLP FOR EACH SLIPOLPEN L BE BRIGHTER
2729,YES I CAN UM I CAN TELL YOU FOR ONE THING THESE ONES NEITHER OF THESE ARE PARALLEL BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM GO LIKE THAT AND THAT N ALL THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING SEE LIKE THAT,YES I CAN UM I CAN TELL YOU FOR ONE THING THESE ONES NEITHER OF THESE ARE PARALLEL BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM GO LIKE THAT AND THAT ALL THE WIVES ARE TOUCHING SEE LIKE THAT
2730,YES WE DID,YESTERDAY
2731,YES WE DID,YES WE DID
2732,THOSE ARE THE WIRES AND THOSE ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,THOSE ARE THE WIRES AND THOSE ARE THE LIPALLS
2733,TWO,
2734,YES,IS
2735,WELL WHAT WE DID WAS WE JUST TOOK A BATTERY THERE AND THEN WE JUST DID THAT AND WE THOUGHT THAT THOSE WOULD MIX AND THEY DIDN'T SOME,WELLT WE DID WE WE JUST TOOK A BATTERY THERE AND THEN WE JUST DID THAT AND WE THOUGHT THAT THOSE WOULD MIX AND THEY DIDN'T
2736,DIAMOND,DINIE
2737,YES THEY ARE OPPOSITES THIS ONE IS NOT FACING THAT WAY SO THERE IS NOTHING RIGHT THERE AND THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT THERE WHICH MEANS THAT THE BACKS AND THE BACK OR THE PAH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BOTH THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND BOTH THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND ARE GOING THAT WAY NEGATIVE POSITIVE,YES THEY ARE OPPOSITES THIS ONE IS NOT FACING THAT WAY SO THERE IS NOTHING RIGHT THERE AND THERE'S NOTHIG RIGHT THERE WHICH MEANS AT THE BACKS AND THE BACK OR THE PO THE NEGATIVE SIDE BOTH THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND BOTH THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND GOING THAT WAY NEGATIVE POSITIVE
2738,MMM HMM YES,TO HESELS YE UP MURNENT YES
2739,THE RECEIVERS YES,THE RECEIVINGERS YES
2740,OKAY NO NOT AT ALL,K NO DO
2741,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATTERY'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO GIVE OFF TO THAT ONE IF THAT ONE'S BROKEN THERE'S NO ENERGY TO GIVE OFF TO THE OTHER RECEIVER,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATTERY SUPPOSE TO GIVE UP ENERGY THIS ONE TO GIVE OFF TO THAT ONE IF THAT WAS BROKEN THERE WAS NO ENERGY TO GIVE OF TO THE OTHE RECEIVER
2742,NO,NOW
2743,WELL SAME THING IF IF SAY THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THAT ONE WOULD GET OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE BUT IF THIS ONE WEREN'T THERE THEN IT WOULD NOT GET ANYTHING EVE IF BUT IF THERE WAS A SWITCH HERE IF THIS WERE THERE AND I DID THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IT WOULD GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN IT WOULDN'T QUITE MATCH UP WITH THAT IF THAT WASN'T THERE AND THEN IT'S GONE,WELL THE SAME THING IF IF SAY THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THAT ONE WOULD GET OFF ENERGY THAT ONE BUT IF THIS ONE WERE THERE THEN IT WOULD NOT GET ANYTHING EVEN IF BUT IF THERE WAS A SWITCH HERE IF THIS WERE THERE AND I DID THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IT WOULD GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN IT WOULDN'T QUITE MATCH UP WITH THAT IF THAT WASN'T THERE AND THEN IT'S GONE
2744,YEP YEP,
2745,WELL THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO TODAY WAS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE TWO OF THE SERIES UM CIRCUIT AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER THOUGH WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A CIRCUIT WHICH WOULD BE,WELL THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO TO DAY WAS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE TWO OF THE SERIES A CIRCUIT AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT BRITER THOUGH WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A CIRCUIT WHICH WOULD BE
2746,YES S BECAUSE WITHOUT THE WIRES WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE UH ENERGY GO THROUGH TO THE BAT TO THE MOTOR OR THE LIGHT BULB,YET SORT WORT WORTING OF  JS BECAUSE WITHOUT THE WIRES WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE A ENERGY GO THROUGH TO THE BAT TO THE MOTOR OR THE LIPO
2747,THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH THIS METAL BAR AND INTO THE OTHER UM METAL PIECE AND GOING THOUGH BACK TO THE WIRES AND INTO THE ENERGY SOURCE,THE ELECTRICITYES GOING THROUGH THIS METAL BAR AND INTO THE OTHER UM METALPIECE AND GOING THREUG BACK THE WIRES AND INTO THE ENERGY SORSE
2748,YOU NEED TO HOOK THEM TOGETHER SO IT MAKES MORE ENERGY FOR THEM TO FLOW,YOU NEED TO HOOK THEM TOGETHER SO IT MAKES MORE ENERGY FOR THEM TO FLOW
2749,WELL THE WIRES UM CAUSE IT'S METAL TO METAL AND W THE WELL WHEN METAL AND METAL CONNECT THE BATTERY WILL GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THE WIRES THAT SENDS THROUGH THE COPPER INTO THE UM INTO THE LIGHT BULBS OR THE MOTOR,WELL THE WIRES ACAUSE IT'S METAL TO METAL AND THE WELL WHEN METAL AND METAL CANNACT THE BATTERY WILL GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THE WIRES THAT SENDS THROUGH THE COPPER INTO THE A INTO THE LIPOBS OR THE MOTOR
2750,YES,YES
2751,OKAY,OK AN
2752,YES YEAH MMM HMM,JAATLY TE I TE THERSCYA SEE GREAT O WAT AEN SO
2753,MMM HMM NO,VERITY FOR HIU BETWEEN NO
2754,MMM HMM OKAY UH NO NOT AT ALL,I GE YOU HAVY QUESTION AH YOU FELLOW
2755,UH IT'S PATH,A ITS PATH
2756,WELL IF THAT ONE GAVE OFF ENERGY TO THAT AND THEN IT CAME UP TO HERE IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU GOTTA TURN THE SWITCH ONTO HERE AND THEN E ENERGY GO THROUGH THE METAL AND GO THROUGH THERE AND THEN GO BACK,WELL IF THAT ONE GAVE A VINDER TO DO THAT AND THEN IT CAME UP TO HEAR IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE HE GOT TURN A SWITCH ON TO HEAR AND THEN MGY GO THROUGH THE MEADOW AND GO THROUGH THERE AND THEN GO BACK
2757,UH THEN IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH BRIGHTER TWO YEAH LIKE THESE TWO THERE'S TWO HERE,AH THEN IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH BRIGHTER TIL O OSORTS LA LIKE THIS TO THERES TWO HERE
2758,MMM HMM OKAY,E I
2759,IT WOULD GO IN HERE AND IT WOULD MAKE THAT ONE LIGHT UP,IT WOULD GO IN HERE ANDIT WOULD MAKE THAT ONE LIE
2760,CAN'T GO OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES,CAN'T GO OUT OF THE NIGHT
2761,PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AND OFF SWITCH,PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AN OWF SWITCH
2762,UH WHAT WE DID WAS WE TRIED THAT ONLY THERE WAS A BATTERY HERE AND A BATTERY THERE BUT WHAT I WAS THEN THINKING WAS WELL THEN WHY NOT MAKE THE BATTERIES CONNECT CAUSE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE N TWO MORE WIRES AND CONNECT THE BATTERIES SO THAT IT WOULD FIT AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE OFF TWO ENERGY SOURCES BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTERIES CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCES WILL MIX AND IT WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER,AH WHAT WE DID WAS DE TRI THAT ONLY THERE AS A BATTERY HERE AN A BATERY THERE BUT WHIT I WAS THEN THINKING WAS WELL THEN WHY NOT MAKE THE BATTERIES CONNECT CAUSE I WAS THINKING THAT MAY WE COULD TE AN TWO MORE WIRES IN CONNECT THE BATTERIES SO THAT IT WOULD FIT AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE OFF TWO ENERGY SOURCES BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTERIES CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCES WON'T MIX IN IT'LL MAKE IT BREIHTER
2763,BYE I WANNA SEE NO I HAVEN'T,I HOW UN TO SEE SELF NO I HAVEN
2764,YES MMM HMM,GUESS SO ED YO WER
2765,BECAUSE IT GOES IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT MMM HMM YES THEY ARE,BECAUSE IT GOES IN A CIRCLE SAVERS AND WHAT DO SO YESTAY
2766,DEPENDING ON UM HOW MANY LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES YOU USE LIGHT BULBS PRETTY MUCH CAUSE IF THERE'S FOUR THEN THERE WOULD BE FOUR CIRCUITS,DEPENDING ON ON HOW MANY LIPOLBS AND WIRETH YOU LIPOBS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE IF THERE'S FOUR THAN THERE BE FOUR CIRCUITS
2767,THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU GO AGAIN HERE'S THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT'LL GO DOWN PAR WELL,THAT'S THE LIPOB AND THEN YOU'LL GO AGAIN HERE'S TO LIUB THEN L GO DOWN WE WPASE WELL
2768,WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VARY FROM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO A REGULAR CIRCUIT,WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VERY FORM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERY CIRCUIT TO IRREGULAR
2769,THEY DON'T WORK,THEY DON'T MARK
2770,THE OTHER WAY,GATHERAC
2771,YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN,YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHING WOULDHAPPEN
2772,WELL UM,WELL OUN
2773,GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES OUT,GOES INTE HERE GOES INTO HER THO OUT
2774,PATHWAYS THERE'S UH THREE,PATHWAYS THERE'S A THREE
2775,OKAY,
2776,YES,YES
2777,YEAH,
2778,THERE IS NO CIRCLE OR CONNECTION THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING,THERE IS NO CIRCLE OR CONNECTION THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
2779,YES THEY GOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T BOTH USING OFF OF THE SAME WIRE SO IT GOT BRIGHTER,YES THEY GOT BRIGTER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T BOTH USING OFF OF THE SAME WIRE SO IT GOT BRIGHTER
2780,Y YEAH I THINK IT MIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEED THESE TO GO THROUGH HERE YOU ALSO JUST IT'LL FLOW BETTER I THINK,YEH YE I THINK IT MIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEED THESE TO GO THROUGH HERE YOU ALSO JUST IT'LL FLOW BETTER I THINK
2781,UM WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER BECAUSE EVEN IN THIS ONE IT GIVES OFF A LOT OF LIGHT BUT WITH THEY'RE TWO IT'D BE JUST LIKE THAT ONE IT'D BE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT,UHWELL I THINK IT WULD BE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER BECAUSE EVEN IN THIS ONE IT GIVES OFF A LOT OF LIGHT BUT WITH THERE ARE TWO IT'UD BE JUST LIKE THAT ONE IT'UD BE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT
2782,AND THEN IT'LL GO AGAIN AND THEN AGAIN THEN,AS AND THEN IT ILL GO AGAIN AND DON GET WE
2783,THAT ONLY WITH TWO OF THEM THAT WERE BRIGHT SO JUST LIKE THIS ONLY BRIGHTER,THAT ONLY WITH TWO OF THEM THAT WERE BRIGHT SO JUST LIKE THIS ONLY BRIGHTER
2784,YES ONLY THESE WOULD PUT OFF MORE ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,YES ONLY THESE WOULD POFT MORE ENERGY IS  I THOUGHT
2785,GOOD,GOOD
2786,YES,YES
2787,A SERIES CIRCUIT OKAY YEP THEN IT'D BE LIKE THAT LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE A SERIES CIRCUIT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT,A SERIOUS CIRCUIT A GAT FIRS SORCAS PESCRITIBL YEP IT WOUD BE LIKE THAT LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE A SERIOUS CICU  CERIOUS CIRCUIT I SHOULD I
2788,OH YE WE TRIED THAT ONLY WITHOUT THAT,A YOSWE TRIED THAT ONLY WITHOUT THAT
2789,I WOULD STOP HERE I'D GO THROUGH AND THEN I'D GO BACK AROUND,I WOULD STOP HERE I GO THROUGH AND THEN I GO BACK ROUND
2790,YEAH PARALLEL,NO COAS OR EXIDE PARALLEL
2791,YES MMM HMM,YES O
2792,UH YOU NEED THE WIRES MMM HMM,AH YOU NEED WIRES
2793,WE ACTUALLY DID IT WITH THREE LIGHT BULBS WELL WE ALSO JUST WE JUST TAKE ANOTHER ONE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST KEEP ADDING ON ADDING ON ADDING ON,WE ACTUALLY DID WITH THREE LIPELES WELL WE ALLSO WE JUST TAKE ANOTHER ONE WELL YOU DO DID JUST KEEP EDDING ON ADDING ON ADDING ON
2794,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S UM SURE WELL I'M GONNA DO IT IN A CERTAIN FORM IT GOES LIKE THERE'S THE BATTERY,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S AMSURE WELL I'M GOING TO DO IT IN THE CERTAIN FOR GOSLIKE THERE'S THE BATTERY
2795,OKAY,ATI
2796,YES A SPONGE IS NOT A CONDUCTOR,YES AS BONGER'S NOT A CONDUCTOR
2797,BECAUSE IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE JUST LIKE THESE ARE ENERGY SOURCES,BECAUSE IT IS AT ENERGY SOURCE JUST LIKE THESE AR ANERDESOURCES
2798,SEPARATE UM MEANS THAT THE WIRES DON'T TOUCH,SEPARATE FUM MEANS THAT THE WIRES DON'T TOUCH
2799,BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT METAL IF IT'S SAY UH SPONGE IT WON'T GO THOUGH BECAUSE WHEN METAL GOES THROU WHEN ENERGY GOES THOUGH METAL IT GOES THROUGH QUICKER AND IT DOESN'T UM IT JUST GOES THROUGH A LOT QUICKER BECAUSE IT IS WELL,BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT METAL IF IT SAY TH SPONGE IT WON'T GO THROUGH BECAUSE WHEN METAL GOES TOWHEN ENERGY GOES TO METAL IT GOES THROUGH QUICKER AND IT DOESN'T COM IT JUST GOES THROUGH A LOT QUICKER BECAUSE IT IS WELL
