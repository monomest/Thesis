275,YOU WEIGH THEM,WAE
276,NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED,T CONCONTRATED I NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCNTRATED
277,THE SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT WILL BE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE SOLUTION ON THE LEFT BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE IN IT,THE SILLUSION ON THE RITE WILL BEMOR CONCENRATEDTHE SILLUSION    BECASAS R U

280,GOOD,O
281,YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE MAYBE ONE CUP OF WATER THAT IS MORE CONCENTRATED MIGHT HAVE MAYBE DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER,YOU AN SEL BECAS MA BE ONE CP OF WATERIS  CONCNTRATED BE DARKER LITER THEN THE OTHER
282,BECAUSE WHEN THE SOLUTE DISSOLVES IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY IT STAYS TWENTY GRAMS AND TEN GRAMS EVEN WHEN IT'S DISSOLVED,THESALLOUT DOES LPH NEVER RELLYGS TWENTY GRAMTHS IN TEN CRAMS EVEN

489,WE FOUND OUT THAT ONE WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ANOTHER WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB,WE FOUNDAT ONE MLE  BE  SIGHE TH LA TH BT
490,UM WE'VE BEEN GETTING A D BATTERY AND UM WE HAD TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO ATTACH THEM SOMEHOW AND GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP,GETING ATE MATOY I ARMWEV HAD TWO BES EN WE HAD AACH SOM OW A LO
491,I THINK THAT ONCE THE ELECTRICITY GOES UP THE WIRE ON THE INSIDE THE FILAMENT LIGHTS UP CAUSING IT THE THE WHOLE GLASS BULB TO SHINE,I THINKTHAT WON ELEP TISONE GOSP THE WAER ON THE INSIDE C OD GLASS
492,I THINK THAT IS ABOUT BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT UP I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT WAY,I THINK ABOUT  BECAUSNOETO LIGHT UP I THINK IT HAS GO THAT WAY
493,SO IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE,GOWING IN A CIRCUL
494,I MEAN THAT UM THE CIRC THE ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRE IN THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY,THECL TRISODY IS RUNING TRO THE WAR IN THE LABEL BAATER
495,YES LIKE THAT,LIKE THAT

499,SURE,HO
500,I THINK THIS IS ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND COMING BACK INTO THE BATTERY,I THINKS LECGOING THRO THE WATER EN CM BACO
501,I THINK THERE ARE IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE RIGHT NOW,I THINK THE RARCE DO
502,UM BECAUSE THE GLASS DOESN'T HAVE ANY WIRES ATTACHED TO IT SO IT WOULDN'T LIGHT,BECAUS GLASS DOESN'T HAVE NEY WLED A TACHED
503,WE UM WE DID IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY WE TOOK TWO WIRES ATTACHED ONE TO THE NEGATIVE ONE TO THE POSITIVE AND THEN WE HAD THE LIGHT BULB AND WE PUT THE TWO SIDE ONE SIDE FROM EACH UM ONE SIDE FROM EACH WIRE AND ATTA UM TACH THE LIGHT BULB AND IT LIT UP,E DINT W WEKI TATCHED ONETH NEGTV   PASIFT WE HAD THE LIOBPUTT T ONE SIDE FROM  MSIDS RAERE  TUCH THE LIOB
504,YES,S
505,UM A CIRCUIT WELL I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT A CIRCUIT CIRCLE IS THE LIGHT BULB AND THE WIRE AND IT RUNS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND KEEPS ON GOING IN A CIRCLE,WILL NATZACLY A CIRCUT CIRCUL IS THE LIE BOB IN THE E RUN THRO THE LBON
506,UM THAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE TAKES ELECTRICITY IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE AND FROM THE PICTURE IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH THIS M METAL THING IN THE LIGHT BULB AND CAUSES IT TO LIGHT UP,THE NAGR I SI TAKES ILIT FLOWS  THE RATHE PICTURE LOOKGS TRO THI MEDOW C TO
507,UM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE WIRES TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB OTHERWISE IT WON'T LIGHT AND THEREFORE NO LIGHT,I THINFOR THE WARES TUCHED THE LIBOLL
508,UM THE ONE WITH THE MINUS SIDE IS CALLED THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE ONE WITH THE PLUS SIGN IS CALLED THE POSITIVE SIDE,ON WITHTH BYISIGE ISC NAGATIVSID   WITH RUS
509,YES EXCEPT THE BLUE THING WASN'T AS BIG,THE BLUESIN WAS AS BIG
510,NO BECAUSE IT THE LOOKS LIKE THAT IT THE METAL ON THE INSIDE MUST BE TOUCH TOUCHING THIS OTHER TYPE OF METAL,BECAS THEIL LOOKES LIKETHAT MADOL ON THE INSIDE MST BE TU CHERING THE ALLER TIPE OF MATOLES

512,YES I THINK SO,YESI THINK SO
513,I THINK THERE MIGHT BE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE,THINK THA MIT BELY S
514,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND DOWN TO THE OTHER WIRE,LOOK LIKE THAT IT GOS THRO THEN DOWN THE EAR
515,NO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD,DON'T THINKW
516,NO BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND BACK IN THE BATTERY,BECAUS THE ILLECTISIOT GOS TRO THE WAR
517,YES BECAUSE SOME ELECTRICITY IS BEING USED BY THE LIGHT BULB,BECAS SOMEON OK USED BY THE LAGP
518,WE FOUND OUT THAT UM UM ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE PO UH UM FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,WENTA ELLEC TRISODYE FLOWS FROM THE UMFOM THE NEGIVSIDH THRO THE LPEN TO THE PASTIV
519,THINK I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE IF THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE WIRE ON THE INSIDE IT WON'T LIGHT,I THINK THAT IS BECAUSIF THE WAERE ISIN'T CMUCH THE WAERHE INSIDE
520,NO BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED THE UNIT TODAY,ABECAUS YOU JUST STARVED
521,JUST A LITTLE BIT,USAL
522,UM WE FOUND THAT MAGNETS STICK TO IRON AND NOT TO BRASS AND THEY STICK TO STEEL,WE FOUND THE MABI STICK TO D AL
523,WE HAVE BEEN UM SEEING WHICH KINDS OF METAL STICK TO MAGNETS,WEHAVE SENGICH CINDS F METOES

660,IT LOOKS LIKE A REPEATING SESSION OF THE FOOD CHAIN,IT LOOKED LIKEA REPEUTING ZATION OVE THE FLEWCHANG
661,I SEE WOOD I SEE A LITTLE DESK KIND OF THING WITH DRAWERS A CANDLE APPLE AND GAS,I SEE A I SEEA LITLEC RA CANDLE APLE WT GRASS
662,WHAT,WT
663,WELL I SEE THAT SHE'S WALKING AND THAT BURNS OFF A LOT OF CALORIES AND SHE'S EATING AN APPLE WHICH IS VERY GOOD PROTEIN,HE IS WAING TH LO CALLRY  AWH IS VERY
664,THE GIRLS GETS HER ENERGY BECAUSE AS SHE'S WALKING SHE'S BURNING A LOT A LOT A LOT OF FLAMES AND SO ON SO YEAH,TDOU GIVS YOAR ENERGY BECASWHEN SHE IS WAGING SHE IS BIRIN OOTO OTER PLA AND SOONSO
665,THE ENERGY THE FEET AND THE FOOD,THE ENERGY A R
666,ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,ETAGERY HAS AUN FORTUONAT BECASS
667,THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE COAL IS A A SOLID AND LET'S SEE THE GAS IS A LIQUID AND SO THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS,HEAR DIFRN BECAS THE A SOLD A N AME JUST AIS LICAD NT  DIFRN TGS
668,LIKE YOUR HAND WOULD BE ON IT IT FEELS REALLY REALLY HOT AND IT ALSO LIKE COULD BURN YOU,YOUR HAND B REALLY RELLY HOT  SPAWIN YOU

670,BYE SEE YA LATER ALLIGATOR,BS A THE RELEGATOR
671,IT WILL START A VERY BIG FIRE,IT WILL SA E VRY BG FIER
672,THE IT MELTS AND IT SINCE IT'S GETTING SO HOT IT JUST MELTS IT DOWN IT MELTS DOWN AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING DOWN AND TO GOING DOWN UNTIL THE CANDLE FINALLY ENDS BECAUSE THE FLAME IS SO HOT THAT IT MELTS THE WAX AND THEN THE WAX IS SO HOT FROM THE FLAME IT JUST KEEPS GOING ON AND ON AND ON UNTIL IT GETS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM,IS GETING SO HOT ITPS GDGTHE FLAIME IS SO HOTHE WAG IS S HOT FROM THE PFLANIST GIT GETS DOWN THE BATTEAM
673,I DON'T KNOW YOU TELL ME I FORGOT WHAT YOU KEEP SAYING BECAUSE,M I RGO Z
674,YOU CAN HEAR REALLY REALLY REALLY QUICK TAPPING SOUNDS LIKE,YOU CAN REALLY REALLY REALLY  COUSHING SONDESLIKE
675,THEY'RE ONE'S LIQUID AND THE OTHER ONE'S SOLID BUT THEY BOTH CAN CREATE FIRE,ONE LINT IN THE OTHERD CAN BOTH CREATE FIRE
676,I SEE THE WICK IS BURNING AND THE THE WAX IS MELTING,I SEE THE WIG IS BIRING IN THEA MELTED
677,THE WAX IS MELTING,THE WAGGAON IS MELTYD
678,BECAUSE SHE WALKING AND SHE'S EATING REALLY GOOD PROTEIN,BECAUSHE IS WALKINGHE IS ETING WILL

684,THE AIR STARTS TO BECOME BECOME SMOKE,THE A BECUM SMOKE
685,THE FLAME IT'S BURNING THE FLAME IS SO HOT THAT IT BURNS THE WAX AND IT BURNS THE WICK,THE FLTHE FLANE IS SO HOT THET IT BITHWA
686,YOU TELL ME,YUCOMA
687,IF IT'S A CANDLE THE CANDLE CAN BE LIT UNTIL THE WAX IS ALL ALL GONE OR IF IT'S A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN KEEP YOU CAN KEEP USING IT UNTIL THE FILAMENT IS GONE OR UNTIL IT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE UNTIL YOU'VE USED TOO MANY ENERGY,A CADO CANDLE CAN BE UNTELL THE ROBOLYOUNTHE AG ISGADANAL DOES NOT WIRK A N TELL YOUETARGY

690,IT GIVES OFF ELECTRICITY,GIVES ALETICY
691,WHAT,WEA
692,BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO WITH JUST ONE ENERGY CELL,BIRT LABAS ARE LIKIN THE OTHERJUST OEL
693,ONLY ONE OF THEM WILL LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY,ONLY ONTHEMIL LIGH OUP BECAUS IT IS NOT AN A LECTRISODY
694,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM,WE ERDABUT MATHATISON
695,THERE'S TWO REASONS BECAUSE NEGATIVE CAN'T THE NEGATIVE SIDE CAN'T GO THROUGH AND THEN COME OUT COME INTO NEGATIVE SIDE AGAIN AND ALSO THE TWO THERE'S TWO THERE'S THE TWO D CELLS ARE HOOKED ONTO EACH OTHER FROM BOTH SIDES,BGR TION BECASNATHE NAGAIV SIDE CAN'T GO TRO AN INNALTHE TWOTH STEUTI SELLES AR  DO T THERD
696,I THINK BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP BETTER BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY,I THINKLTER BECAUSE IS
697,THEY'RE BOTH LIT UP BUT THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE NOT REALLY THEY'RE NOT LIGHT HOW AS LIGHT AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THEY'RE REALLY REALLY DIM,THE BIG LIPT UPENOIRSUPSED REALLY REALLY
698,ELECTRICITY,ILLECTICY
699,EVERY TIME I CLICK ON IT IT CHANGED THE ONE SIDE OF A D CELL AND TURNED IT THE RIGHT WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO SUPPOSED TO BE AND WHEN YOU TURN IT THAT WAY THERE'S ELECTROMAGNETISM COMING THROUGH ONE SIDE AND THEN GOING OUT THE OTHER SO IT MAKES MORE ELECTRICITY AND WHEN YOU MAKE MORE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP,EVERY TIME MY C CHANGED ONE SIDE OF  DEALRN THE RWAN WN YOU TURN THATM NSIDEOTHERMKLTLT
700,EACH SIDE OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE AND THE AND THE POSITIVE AND ON THE BOTTOM IT HAS TO TOUCH THE CORE OF IT AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB,EASIDA THE AER HAS TO BE TUCHD TH NEGD AND ND THE BOTEM IT AS A UCHD THE BOTEMELAPL
701,WELL WE DID A PROJECT OF THIS THE OTHER DAY AND WE HAD A QUESTION ON OUR WORD WALL WHAT IF WE HAD TWO LIGHT BULBS COULD WE MAKE BOTH OF THEM LIGHT UP WITH THE CIRCUIT AND SOME PEOPLE SAID YES AND SOME PEOPLE SAID NO BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY DID IT ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB LIT UP BECAUSE THAT IT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH D CELL ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH AND ON TO THE BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS,WE D A OBJECTI SIDWE HAD A SON  AWE TO  COUD W MAKE BODTS OF PITIRPEOPLE M PEOPLE S WHEN WE ACTOLY DIDNT ONLY ONMTHE WAS THE A CRO
702,THERE HAS TO BE FULL COMPONENTS TO DO A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,SIR HAS PEPLE COMPTMENT A COMPLEET CIRCUS
703,IF YOU TURN ONE D CELL AROUND AND A NEGATIVE WOULD FACE ONE DIRECTION AND THE AND THE OTHER AND THE PLUS SIGN WOULD FACE THE OTHER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TWO TWO COMPONENTS FACING THE SAME DIRECTION THEN THE TWO D CELL COMPONENTS WILL NOT THERE WON'T BE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BATTERIES IN THEM AND IN THE BACK,YOU TURN HE ELROU INA A THES WON DIRACTION I THE  THE OTHERBECASIF YOU HAVE COMPMIONT ASING THE SAIME DIRACTION  COMPANT WILL NOTLETLONG THRO BESHA
704,A CIRCUIT IS ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM,S ABOUT ALETMATMATISOM

706,POSITIVE CAN'T GO IN IT,DEPAUSATIEVES CAN'T GO
707,THEY'RE ALL AN ENERGY SOURCE,ALAN ERED HE HORSCE
708,THEY'RE ALL TOUCHING EACH SIDE OF THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES LIKE ON THE BATTERY IT HAS THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDES AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH IT CAN'T IF YOU USE THE BATTERIES IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COME OUT AND COME OUT OF THE NEGATIVE,THE ELDPLUSONG E SIGHE OF THE PUOTS AN NAOTHE BRIT HAS A NEGI DEPLASETENDIT CAN'T GO TROIT CA UBUE ATERES IT CANT GO NAG
709,THE D CELL THE AND THE TWO LIGHT BULBS,C DESAE BE INT TWOO LIFEBATS
710,THAT IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO EACH OBJECT AND INTO EACH COMPONENT AND IT GOES IT COMES IN IT GOES OUT THE NEGATIVE AND THROUGH IT TOUCHES THE CORE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS AND IT GOES IN THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT FLOWS OUT THE BOTTOM AND THE SAME PATTERN GOES AFTER THE OTHER AND COMES AROUND AND GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY,THAT IS THE ELE TIRSON FLOWING THRO THE WATERI S BECA MEATS AS I UPTHE NDSEGS I THE ELECTIS THE BOUTTEM M PTER  THE

776,YES,YES
777,GOOD,GOD
778,WHAT WE DID IS UM FIRST WE MEASURED PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEN UM WE MEASURED THIS WE AND THEN WE MEASURED THE APPLE TO THE PART OF PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEY WERE THE EXACT SAME SO WE KNEW THAT IT HAD TO BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN GRAMS AND THEN WE JUST WHICH UM HELPED US FIGURE OUT THE THE PROBLEM,FRST WE MESERED A GRALSRED THE APLE  GROLE ACK SAMENE HAD BE A HONDRED FIFTY SEVEN GRADSHELPE UM
779,ACTUALLY WE MEASURED THE GRAVEL THEN THE APPLE WE MEASURED PART OF THE GRAVEL AND THEN WE MEASURE AND THEN WE PUT PART OF THE GRAVEL WITH THE AP APPLE AND THEN THEY WERE EQUAL SO WE KNOW HOW MUCH THE APPLE WAS,WETOD  GRALWE RAWE PU PART THE GROL WIT THE EAPLE SHEING NEW HO MUCH THE APLE WAS
780,NO,OWL
781,YES A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN GRAMS,HE HAS A HONDERED FIFTY SEVEN GRAMPS
782,THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE WHAT OUR GRAM PIECES LOOK LIKE AND IT'S KINDA SHOWING GRAMS AND JUST LIKE SHOWING LIKE SOME ABBREVIATIONS FOR GRAMS AND KIL KILOGRAMS AND GR AND LIKE HOW MANY GRAMS GO INTO ONE KILOGRAM,THAT CL LOOKE LIKE WITH GRAMPESES LOOKED LIKE AN  CAROSHLNG AJST LIKEING  REVIATIONS FORGM  ACRA
783,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME,COULD YO PEATTHA OM
784,YOU WOULD PICK UP THE BALL AND PUT IT IN ONE OF THE CUPS AND THEN YOU WOULD PUT THE GRAMS PIECES IN LIKE ALL LIKE YOU START WITH LIKE PUTTING LIKE A CO LIKE A COUPLE OF FIVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE YOU JUST KEEP PUTTING MORE AND MORE IN UNTIL IT'S LIKE ALMOST EQUAL INTO THE EQUALEST YOU CAN GET IT,YOWLD PAKE OUP THE BN UT W PUT HE DRAM PEASES INAR WIT PUTA COPL OF FA SOMTHIN JUST U

1248,THERE'S UM SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THEN A WASHER'S GOING INTO THE UM UM THE CUP,SPASERES BETWEEN THE MAGMIONTS IN TH IASHIO GOING IN TO THE M
1249,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER,WATH THEY PUT IN THE FRAGMENT THE RH BECAMES WEAKER
1250,THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE UM THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AREN'T AS UM STRONG,OAS THEIRAR THE HIERTI LOOKES LIKE THEEORN ETWEENTH FRAGMONT
1251,UM WELL WHEN Y WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GONNA PU IT'S GONNA PROBABLY BREAK MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNET,W YOU PUT THE WATER IN MOR EASERLY BECAUS THE SVASER BETWEEN THE AGMONTDS
1252,WHEN THERE'S SPACE BETWEEN UM THE MAGNETS UM THE FORCE ISN'T AS STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASILY,THER SPASE BETWEEN TH FAGMENT R IN A RA THE  ELY
1253,THERE'S A BIGGER UM LIKE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM WHEN THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,THET IS A BIGSASE BETWEENT IR LROE TOPOF EACHOTHER

1255,WELL IN GROUP C THERE'S ONLY FI IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WASHERS WITH N ZERO SPACERS AND IN A B AND D IT ALL THEY TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS,THER ONLYVNLY TOOK FIVE WATER WITH ZERO AS  ABIOO NIN TEEN WATERS
1256,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS IN THERE TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS IN THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRIED TO BREAK THE FORCE AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPACER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAK THE FORCE,T FRAGMENTWP WATER IN THEWE TRYD TO BAK THE  WATHERS TOOK TOYT YOU PUT A SPASER BETWEEN ELL SIXPSHN WATER
1257,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES,I NOTITHEPA TEAR THES WATER IT TAKES
1258,BYE SEE YOU TOMORROW,SEEVE TOMORROW
1259,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER UM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT IS A UM THAT THE SPACER IS IN BETWEEN,I THINK THAT WIN YOU PUT THE ASER BETWEEN THE MAGMENT I THINKSRG BECAUSE THE FA
1260,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM MAGNETS AND THEY SEEING HOW HOW F UM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,PEL E WIARKING WITH  MAGMENTS I SEING HEVIY THE C
1261,UM IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK,THE FRAGMENT TOGEATHER ITMAW
1262,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BR HOW MANY WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,W PUT ON THEAR S HO MONEY IT C WATER
1263,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS ARE THE FORCE IS LEA IT'S UM WEAKENING,IT GETS MART IN THE FRAGMENT
1264,UM THE MORE WASHERS THAT YOU ADD THE EASIER OR WHEN THE THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE LE IT'S NOT AS STRONG SO THEY BREAK APART,OU WATSHE YOU AD THE EASIERTHE STRENG GET L P
1265,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE UM ER AND THEN WE WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG IT HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BROKE,YOUSN WE PUT STASERS BETWEEN BALONPUTTHE MAGMENT TO GETHERTRO WE PUT THE AH ON THE OTHER SIDE WATER IC THES
1266,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS,E LIRND ABOUT TEMPERARY AGMENTS
1267,IT'S LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM AND IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LON HOW THE FORCE HOW MU HOW BY TOGETHER THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE FOR THERE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE,G RAGMONT WEN THE HAVE SPASE BETWEEN AL SOINGMAGOTR
1268,WE USE THE BALANCE AND WE PUT LIKE SPACE UH WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONE SIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS IN IT AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AH AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPACERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK BEFORE THE B FORCE BROKE,N MAGMENT ON ONSID WATH SVASERS BETWEEN THE MAMONTN E ACH TIME WE PUT ASERS  N WATHERFR TH
1269,WELL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STICK THEY JUST LIKE PUSHED APART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALMOST NO WAY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PUT 'EM TOGETHER THEY'D GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UM SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORCE THERE,MSTAK JUST PUSHT ALMOSPSCSYOU TRYD TO PUT T THERSIDEMHI YO WILL S ARDTOIT BECAUSTHE O'T GO OGEATHER BECAUS
1270,E REASON ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO G GET THAT IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TOO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE MA THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK,TE STICKS BECAS THE PAPER IS T I TOO MUCH PAPERTERTHE UR STRANG ANOFTRUGANOF MAGMATISOM TOOK G  AI THE URMAISOM DOESN'TIS NOUT STRONG ANOF TO GO THRO  THE PERTTS WY

1272,GOODBYE MARNIE,SUB
1273,UM THERE IS A LIKE A THERE'S LIKE UH THEY COULD LIKE STICK THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT COULD PULL 'EM TOGETHER AND THERE'S A FORCE THAT COULD PUSH 'EM APART,I'MVERY LIK ASIK R TAT CULD POLL THEM TO GETHER IHA U THET CO PUSHION APARTMENT
1274,OH THE ELEC UM THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CLIP MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET,MAGMATISOM ISNT STRONG ANOF TO GO THROOTHER BECAUSBCAUSBECAUS YO THATS WHY IT WON'T GPRMADA
1275,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,IDO' REALLY OW
1276,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IS IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP STAYS AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM,TD IS LIKE A TEMPERRY N A TEMPERY MAGMATISOMOBJECTTMAGMAOM GOS O THE PPE IN THEET S COLD TEMPERY

1278,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THERE IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART,TURN THE Y STICK THER AN SO TURN THE OBWAPUSHA
1279,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UH USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT 'EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK,MAGMATISOM CA BER THINGS IYOUUD LIK CDOTHE STIC A OBE BETWEEN TO MAGMENTS AN ZER STICK TO EACHOTHER TROTH MAGMENTONTOTHIG T TOO TICK A MAGNT NOT STRONGT YO WILL T
1280,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,TIN THETHE MAGMONT IS GOWING A CROSSE THE SANDI MAGMATISM TO THE MATLE MAMATSO ITL MI THEAD MIX THE MALETKE
1281,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,REALLYOW
1282,WELL W WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN 'EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN 'EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT THE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WOR THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE,AP TOWTHER THEIF YOU TURN OLB TE PUSH TURN THE OTHER WAY  I THE  WAYGHER T OL L GGTHERIF YOU TURN OOER THE PUSH
1283,WELL THEY'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT 'EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO LI IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO,ST HTHE S CAN BE REALLY SRO IT AL MOST THRO ISIF ITIS NOTSTROUNG ANOF
1284,AGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL,CNLSUNING MATHMATSOM THROH NALT TH PPERRPER
1285,THERE'S A FORCE THAT PU THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS 'EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER,W THEY GO  THER K  RA GTHER  WAY YOU CAN MOPET A ROUND SOM SARHSTCSTHER
1286,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET MEANS IT'LL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,SBECAUSECAUSTHE DOMAL IS NOTS NOD MAMENTS CAULD A TEMPERYBCIT NO AMEANS WILL AL WAYS STICK WITH OUT EVEN THAT MEANS DON ALWAYS STICK IT JUST FOR  COPLEES

1300,WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE THEY DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST UM UP AND THROUGH SO YEAH,E ONY THE ZR DON'T GMAGO  JUSTA OPENRO
1301,WELL WHEN YOU BURN OUT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOSTLY THEY BOTH GO OFF,W YOU TURNTHAN ATH GO OF
1302,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THEN IT WON'T WORK VERY GOOD,BECAUS A PALO CIRCUS HASI IT ONLY HAS HEOD

1310,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY,TE REPRESENT A PATHWA
1311,I DISCOVERED THAT UM IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIGHT IS THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME,IT SHOS W THE ENEARGRY GOS THROO ND LIKE THE SAME
1312,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S A TWO PATHWAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE'S ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BULBS,APARZL CIRCU TWO PATHWAYS BOTH  THE SAM APUT IN THE ZERO CIRCU ONLY CONEXTED BOS
1313,DIFFERENCES UM IS THAT THE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE SAME AND THEY'RE LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE IT'S THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ENOUGH ENERGY,SL SAOTHER O TEDER  BECAUSIS GOINGTRO THE SAIME PATHTHE OTHER OE TEIRS TWO PATHWAYEST AR GETINGBOTH INARGERY

1315,WELL THE ONE THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS,IT WIDN'T STAY OIF DIDN'T AV PATHWAES
1316,WELL IT H IT'S BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS A DEAD BATTERY IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE IT'S BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COULDN'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON,BECAUSTE HA TO PASTH WAYSI THE ENERGY E S A EATTERT COULDN'T GO THROO THEETER BECAUS THE ATTER ISIT COULDN'T GO THROO THE LIT COULDNT GET SCNY D STA

1319,THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YOU'RE SEPARATING THE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER,AEGRE ROEPERATE FROM THE WATER
1320,CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SIEVE BUT THE WATER AND THE MUD CAN,CAUS THE ROG AN GET TTHE WATERD
1321,THE THE UM SALT IS THE THAT THE THING IS THE BEST FOR THAT ONE BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES IT'S USING EVAPORATION TO GET RID OF THE WATER SO YOU CAN GET IT APART SO YOU JUST HAVE THE SALT,TH SO IS THINGSAR BEST FOR THAT BECAUS IT APERATE I YOUS  APERATION GET REDFHE ATER GET JUSTSO

1416,THE WATERS ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER OR THE MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER,THE WARSRE BENGPELTERED OUT TH ATER MARBLDOF THE WATER
1417,OKAY UM,OKAY
1418,THEY'RE THEY'RE BRING SPLIT INTO PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME,THEIR BENGS SPLOT INT ARTSHAT ARE THE SAME
1419,IT LOOKS LIKE THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT THE SALT IS STILL THERE,IT LOOKED LIKE A SOLDIERBTHE WATER
1420,CAUSE THE LITTLE PEBBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH IT,HL POBLE CAN GO THROT
1421,OKAY,OKAY
1422,BECAUSE OF PARTICLE SIZE,ARDACLE
1423,THAT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OR THE PEBBLES STAYED ON TOP AND THE WATER WENT THROUGH,PEPLE STIKON TOP THE WATER WENT THRO
1424,THAT BECAUSE THE LITTLE ROCK THE THE LITTLE TINY PEBBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH THE PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH IT,BECAUSL TINEYBLES A O THE PAPER WITH WATER
1425,THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP AND THE WATER GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER CUP,THE RO STAMPOP THE WATER GOS THRO
1426,WELL FOR THIS ONE WE ARE USING TO SEPARATE THEM,TH WIN WIL U MAGNIGHT EPERAT
1427,GET SOMETHING WITH AND WE CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET IT OUT,SOMTHING WITH ANIT
1428,THAT THE THAT THE MAGNET TOOK UP THE SAFETY PINS,RAGM TOOK  THE SAFTY PANTS
1429,THE,RAI
1430,THE THE IMPORTANT PROPERTIES THAT THE ROCK THE THE WATER AND THE LIKE MUD IN IT OR WHATEVER IS GOING THROUGH AND THE ROCK AND THE PEBBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP,THIRONPY IS THATH WATER EABLES ARVE STAING ONE TOP
1431,THAT USE THAT ONE BECAUSE THE THE THE SAND THE WATER WOULD EVAPORATE BUT THE SALTS WOULD STAY THERE,YUS THAT BECUSH WATER WILOPERATE IF THE SOLDIE W TAE
1432,A A AND A SOLUTE,SOAU
1433,THAT THAT THE THE SALTS WILL STAY THERE AND THE WATER WILL GO AWAY,ANTTHE SOLDIE WILL STAYN THERNTHE WATER
1434,WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT TOOLS A LOT MORE ABOUT SOLUTES AND SOLVENTS,WHELL WE LIRNABOUT LOBOU SALUDNTS
1435,THE MIXTURES MAYBE,MIXSTURE
1436,BECAUSE BECAUSE OF PARTICLE SIZE TO GET THE ROCKS ON TOP AND THE WATER THROUGH,BECAUS BECAUSE AARACLE YIS OGET THE ROON TO WATER
1437,WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WEVE EN TALKINGABOUT MIXSTURES OND SIELUTIONS
1438,THINK IT'S A MIXTURE,SOME MIXSTURE
1439,THAT THE ROCK CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WATER CAN SO IT'S FRESHENING UP THE WATER,OCAN'T GO SCREEMITHE WATER FRESH UP THE WATER
1440,YOU'RE SEPARATING THE ROCKS OR THE PEBBLES FROM THE WATER,SEPERATING T ROCKS AR PEBLE  FROM THE WATER
1441,THAT A MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MIX SOMETHING MIX ONE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING,MIXSTUR WI YOU IXMMX ONE THING WITHNOTHER HING
1442,BECAUSE EACH ONE HAS DIFFERENT PROPERTIES,BECAUS EAHON HAS DIFRENTPPDY
1443,YOU COULD EVAPORATE IT,COPERATE
1444,IF THERE'S IF THERE'S LIKE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE GET A ROCK OUT OF THEN YOU CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET,A ROG OUHT OF MNIGHT THES
1445,WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE CALM SO IT NEEDS TO BE CALM SO SO SO IT DOESN'T MOVE AROUND A LOT AND JUST TIPS OVER AND SINKS,T NE T BE CUM SO BUM SO DO MOVE  ROUN THE BATH AND JUTI OER STIX
1446,WELL THE DIFFERENCE IS IT'LL THERE'S TOO MUCH IN ONE I SEE ON THE F ON THE ONE ON THE FAR LEFT COULD HOLD THE MOST AND IF IT WOULD WELL THE P WELL I THINK IT WOULD SINK CAUSE THEY'RE ALL THE SAME BUT,DIFRINIRI TOO MUCH I ONEI ONE AR LAT CAN HOLD THE MOAI THINK E WILL THINKAR ALLE THE SAME
1447,MARLIE,O
1448,NOT HARD NO NOT HOW HARD HOW MANY,NOT HAVE HARD HAV MONEY
1449,WE BUILD 'EM OUT OF PAPER CUPS WE PUT 'EM IN THIS LITTLE TANK TO SEE IF IT WOULD FLOAT AND PUT PENNIES IN PENNIES IN TO SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS WOULD FIT IN AND AND IF IT SINK NOT WE DON'T COUNT THE PERSON THAT MADE IT SINK,HE BILL E AUT A PURPLE WE PUT HM IN THIS LTLA TOS IF O SEE HO MANEY PASSONDGIERS WIFITDON' CAA PERSON
1450,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS THE VARIABLES ABOUT,WHELL WE BEN RING ABOUT I VEROBLESUT
1451,WELL IT DEPENDS HOW TALL THEY ARE TO SEE HOW MUCH PENNIES IT COULD HOLD,IER EN YARD TO EMYY CAN HOLD
1452,WELL IF YOU JUST PUT A CHUNK IN THE PAPER CUP IT WOULD TECHNICALLY SINK REAL FAST CAUSE WATER WILL GO IN AND WILL START SINKING,LYO JUST PUT TUB IN THE STING RLO WATER IA
1453,MARLIE ARE YOU THERE MARLIE,AREYUVALY
1454,WELL THE DIFFERENCE WAS ABOUT,DIFRENS WS ABOUT
1455,YOU'RE WELCOME,JUROCO
1456,IT'S ABOUT HOW HEAVY THE PASSENGERS AND UM WE PUT A PENNY IN TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD HOLD THE MOST,A HAVE YOU A PASSONGER INDPUT A TOINKWI WI WI THE MOST
1457,WAY YOU TALK,YOUALK
1458,WELL YOU GOT TO PUT 'EM IN EVENLY CAUSE IF YOU PUT 'EM ON YOU GOT TO SPREAD THEM OUT AND IF YOU PUT 'EM LIKE IN ONE WHOLE STACK FOR SURE IT'S GONNA SINK DOWN REAL FAST,YOUOU EVEN BECAUS  YU PUTS SIRTH CUTIN DOWN  PASST
1459,POKEMON CARDS,SN MY ARAS
1460,WELL I THINK A WILL HOLD THE MOST,I THINK A WILL HOELL THE MOST
1461,NO MARLIE NOT LIFEBOATS JUST BOATS MADE OUT OF PAPER CUPS,NOR LIFE BALTS JUSTBS M PIPER CUS
1462,B WILL HOLD ABOUT TWENTY C WOULD HOLD ABOUT TEN D WOULD HOLD ABOUT SEVEN,WILL HODIXOU HO AOUT TEN  ABOUT SEVEN
1463,MARLIE MARLIE,MA
1464,THEY CARRY PEOPLE AND THEY FLOAT ON WATER AND THE VARIABLES WERE THE VARIABLES WERE ON A PAPER CUP T WE PUT PENNIES IN TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD HOLD THE MOST IN PAPER IN PLASTIC CUPS THAT PAPER CUPS,THE CAR PEOPLE ADTHEY FLOG ON WATERTHE VERY BOTH H VERYBOLTH  O WE PUT PANEYES IN TO SEE RICH O T COD THE MOST IN PAPERINPE
1465,I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,I'M GOOD ABOUT YOU
1466,HOW ARE YOU TOO,WHY ARE YOU TWO
1467,WE PUT WE DROPPED IT FROM A HIGHER DISTANCE AND AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND WE FIRST WE GOT FOURTEEN THEN WE TOOK A PENNY OFF THEN WE GOT FIFTEEN THEN WE ONLY HAD ONE PENNY ON AND WE GOT THIRTEEN,WHELL WIT THE LEING ON THI TREGOUGT  TT NINE SIX TWENTY NINE SEVEN MAUTORSPUT THREE PAS
1468,WELL BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WE'LL GET CONFUSED ABOUT HOW TO PUT IT BACK UP WAS AND THE TEACHER SAID TO DO IT ONE STEP AT A TIME BECAUSE IT'S MORE IT'S EASIER AND MORE BASIC,BECAUSE  NNSWILL G COM FUSED E BOLE OPUT AS THE TEACOR SE WONEABOUT A TIME BECAUS ITITS EASIER THE BASE
1469,WELL IF WE IF WE IF WE SHORTEN IT WE WILL GET LIKE THIRTEEN NO LIKE TWENTY THEN IF WE MADE IT LONGER WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN LIKE SIX WITH THE TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETER ONE AND WITH THE SHORT ONE WITH A WITH A THREE CENTIMETER ONE,SRTIN WE WILL GOO LIE TWTYI WE A A LONG WE WIA G SIX TWO HONDRED EN  MATERBLH SHORT THREE
1470,WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT YET WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT IT ON FRIDAY,WEV HASEN'T REALLY TOLKE ABOUTH YETTK ABOUON FRIDAY
1471,NO WE CHANGED IT ONE STEP AT A TIME SO WE WOULDN'T MESS IT UP,HEL WE SHAREDA ABOUT A TIM SOW
1472,OH THEY WERE ABOUT UM A STRING AND A ATTACHED TO TIED ON TO A PENNY AND THEN IF IF WE WOULD CHANGE WE WOULD CHANGE IT TO SEE IF WE HAD A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT RESULT LIKE PUT TWO PENNIES ON A SHORTER STRING HIGHER DISTANCE HIGHER DROP OFF,THE BOUT THE STRINGTHE TUCHE AITO TO A PATWE D  WE D CAGE TO SEE IF E ADAPUT TOU PANT ZAM SORT STRN  YOU TANSROPOFF
1473,WELL WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PENDULUMS TO SEE HOW HOW MANY TIMES IT COULD SWING SIDE TO SIDE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,WHL WE H EN NG ABOUT TO SHH  TIME I  INSIDE  SIDHE  FIFTEN SECANDS
1474,WELL WE HAD WE WE DIDN'T HAVE WE HAD A RESULT LIKE LIKE IT IT CHANGED IT CHANGED THE WAY AND IT MADE IT GO A LITTLE BIT SLOWER SO WE GOT TEN THAT TIME INSTEAD OF FOURTEEN,WEWE'VE HAD A REZOLT LIKE HE CHANGES THE  ND   CA L BIT FLOERW TEN THAT TIME IN STED OF FORTTUN
1475,WHAT DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT,DID YOU  TALK ABOUT
1476,WELL IT DEPENDS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER THE PROPELLER THAT'S HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE IF YOU HAD A SMALLER RUBBER BAND AND SPINNED IT ABOUT OH FORTY FIVE TIMES IT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE IT ALL THE WAY,N O  TIMES YOU SPINO O FAIT GOA E OU A SMOLL A SPANFOUR FIVE TIME IT WL
1477,CHAIRS TWO CHAIRS AND PUT 'EM TWO YARD STICKS FAR THEN WE TIED STRING THEN WE MADE PAPER AIRPLANES AND THEN TWO S AND THEN MADE IT AND THEN TWISTED THE PROPELLER TO SEE HOW FAR IT WOULD GO,TOO CHAIRS PUT THEM T YARD STICKS FTHE E TIS STRINGTHE  PER PLANS A THETST PLER TO SE HOW FAR WI G
1478,WE FLEW IT ABOUT TWO INCHES SECOND ONE IT WENT ABOUT HALF WAY AND THE THIRD ONE IT WENT WELL LIKE ALL OF THE WAY IT CRASHED IN THE THE CHAIR,FL ABOUT TWO INRS SIRHAF IN TE  OK ALL  CROSS THE CHAIR
1479,WELL ONE,L
1480,WELL NO,WNOEN
1481,IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE VARIABLES AND THE SCIENCE AND HOW TO BUILD THE PLANE AND WHY CHECK THE DISTANCE AND LEARN ABOUT VARIABLES,THIE ABOUT THE TPUPK THE VERBLE THESO WEN ARR TO THE PLAYNDY CKLD T DISPN I
1482,ABOUT VARIABLES,ABOVERL
1483,WE CHANGED THE RUBBER BAND AND THE AND THE KIND OF STRING AND AND WE CHANGED THE WI THE NUMBER OF WINDS WINDS,WE CHASED THE RUDERIN THEA CIND OF STRAINE HASE NOMBER OF AINN
1484,WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES ARE WE GONNA TWIRL THE OH WHAT'S IT CAL PROP,WILL HEF TO THINK ABOUT TIMES IET

1501,THE NUMBER GOES UP HIGHER,THE LEMBER GOWS APIRE
1502,MARNIE ARE YOU THERE,BOAR
1503,WELL WE USED POPSICLE STICKS,WILL WE FA
1504,DISTANCE GOES HIGHER THE DISTANCE GOES HIGHER,TDISTAN GROWS HIGHER A DISTAN GOWS HIGHER
1505,WE TRIED TO SEE 'EM HOW FAR IT WOULD GO AND WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER,WED TRY TO SE HOWWE WIL HAVE THE CHANE TO MK
1506,GOOD BYE MARNIE GOOD BYE,GOOD BUY
1507,OKAY,OKAY
1508,OUR BASE IS LIKE WITH WITH THE POPSICLE STICK WITH A POPSICLE STICK AND YOU PUSH IT AND IT GOES HIGH UP IN THE AIR AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO MEASURE TO SEE HOW DO YOU WANT IT AND WHERE DO YOU WANT IT TO GO,AUR BASHE IS LIKE ERCLE WITH A ERLE WN YOU PUSHECS HIGH UPIN THE ARMTO SEE HAWS Y  A

1530,CAN YOU HEAR ME,SAI
1531,GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,GOD VEW
1532,CAN YOU HEAR ME,ERA
1533,SO DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE,DDON'T TALK ABOUT
1534,GOOD,
1535,THAT THE SWITCH IS CLOSED SO THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET TO MAKE THE WASHERS ATTRACT TO THE RIVET STEEL,THE SWETIS CLOTH INERGY CAN FLO THROESTEVEN RIBEN WO MIK THEAB TRACPT THE

1539,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,RAL
1540,BYE,FIVE
1541,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW ENERGY SHOULD,WE'VE LIRND ABOUT HOU INERGY
1542,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BECAUSE THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THE OTHER BI  BECAS THIS IS A PAO CIRCUS
1543,THE ENERGY CAN FLOW TO THE OTHER ONE,THE INEARGERY CANO FLOW TOO THE OTHER WAN
1544,UHM IT DOESN'T REALLY END UP,I'L P  AIN
1545,IT ALL STOPS,STARP
1546,THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME,SAY ON THE CHERRY SIR CUSHYOUNAME
1547,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BACK TO THE,IR IS CLOTHES NOW THIN THRO LL
1548,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ON THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY BECAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS,M RAN THE OTHER ON IS TL GONG WITH INARGYFATHWATE
1549,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BURN OUT IT TURNS INTO AN OPEN CIRCUIT,WHE ON THE RS PDOTH  R TWON
1550,INTO THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTO,UN THE SCIRCAUT TURN T IN TOTH
1551,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK,BECAUS N THAR BCHEING INEARGYLL IF ONE BRAKESTH OTHER
1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,FIVE SIXFR HAVEN ONE THING
1553,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL,BECAUSE ONE LI IS GETING TOO MUCH INRD
1554,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A,THE  THE N HI CIRCUS GOS ROUND OTH THE BATTERYAND
1555,THAT THREE WIRES ON SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE,THRE ERES ON ONE SIDE  INAGYON THE OTHER SIDE T CIG E INERGY OF
1556,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK,IS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE ELON BRAKESTHE ENERGEY CAULN NOT GO THROFE
1557,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT,ONE LE HAS A BIOGENF IN THE OTHER
1558,I KNOW THAT THEY'RE PARALLEL LINES,I NO THT THER AROC
1559,THE SECOND CIRCUIT,THESECAND CIRCU
1560,GOOD,GD
1561,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH,THAT REAGER IS OPEN SO AN FLOA THRO
1562,THEN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT'S NOT BURNT OUT,THA INERGREMEAR ONLYGOS OUL DOWN
1563,WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS,BAKEO
1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,HOTHA ERISRCUS WIT
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BCUSTHE T LIP
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,THRMS WIING IN ONE THE BO S YOU CAN EVHD WATER WILIN
1567,I DON'T KNOW,DON'TALL
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THE FEAL BRAKES ON ONE COLTH INARGERY
1569,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP,THE LAG WILL INSIDSOMEONES ABOUT TA PUNISH MECE BE ER
1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,DOES NOT THINKA IRDS
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE TH SWET IS OE
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,TO AESAR CONECTD WIT THAT LIPOPNOTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,ESIDE THE INERGRY CAN STIL GO THROO BECAUSAAS
1574,I DON'T KNOW,W
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,TAB DOES NLI BECAUSLETRION CAULD NOT G THEML
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,I'LL BENT TOO AD WHIN THE PRP
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,SDY SIR GISSANDY SOON S AT ARE A BIG CIRCLEN VER SIRT GETS AROT JUST A BIGOL IN THE CIRROCAE

1582,A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,AM ARY CIRCUS MTBE LIKE THIS BE CAS
1583,I THINK THE BULB IS NOT LIT UP BECAUSE IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OPEN,I THINK THE ARL WAS NOT LET OUP BECAUS IS A COD
1584,WHAT'S YOUR NAME,MTURA
1585,ONE LIGHT BULB'S HAVING TOO,ONE E  VE TWO U
1586,THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED TO THE D CELL,THE ROG CADECT THE DE SHAE

1588,THAT ONE OF THEM IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILAMENT IS,THAT WONDER BIS AL BR DOWN THEOTHER
1589,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S AWESOME,I THINKEVERY THING IS ACOM
1590,BECAUSE THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT,BECAUS  HE CIRCU SHORT
1591,STOP STOPS GLOWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB,STAMPHS WILLNG BECTHA ROULE
1592,THAT,THW
1593,WE TOOK SOME STEEL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ATTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE TOOK SOME STAAA LOT OTHER STRVE TO SEE WHT WULD GUM T GETHER WITH EB TRACTI
1594,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP,TAK EATHER THE COUMPEST A PAPERR STEALL SHAANKS ANDRY YOUSE TMTHE COUMPEST WITH YIN OR TOR HAVURADSAVEINGS WHEN YOU FOUND THE W GAUB OP
1595,THEY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE,STICK WAND OLSO THE OLDSAIINS AL SO DIDN'T STICKSIF THE WR UDUN
1596,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS A CIRSTIMEIT DID
1597,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP,ITHEDSTHAY WLDNOT GO IF YOU TAUCHED IT IN
1598,THE NAILS AND THE PAPER CLIP,THE NA AND THE PAPER COLT
1599,SINCE THEY ATTRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS,TTHE CUM THROU INTI SO TMSTENTING APON HO THICKTIS GS  ABELES IN OTHER THINGS
1600,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT,AGT OTHAT CAN MAKE A SRAOERT PICK UP THE PAPERRGER WITHTHE MAGNET AT
1601,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF,THE WAER  IS GAT STIL DMDSF
1602,O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO,THEU DOS WITH THE MADIT DT
1603,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF F WOULD C WOULD MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF,THEY CAIME TO GEATHER BECAS IER MAOT WI MAKE THEM M TO GEATHER SO THATD SOM TIMESGO THRO STOF
1604,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM,WE'VE BEN STARDYNG MAGMOT
1605,AND THE ROCK THE S STEEL ROCK,THE ROCK THE STE ROCK
1606,YES,YES
1607,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE N NET THE NAIL DID,WEV FOUNDOUT THE PAPER COTND NALED
1608,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM STAY LIKE THA,HR YOU PUSHTMAGMENTIF THEY HAVE OPESIT SIDE THEY WILL GUM TOGETHER YOU AN
1609,YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THEY'LL DEPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,E ECAS  TO THEIKARBDI THECAR BRD GO STRA AAO
1610,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T,SO THEMC WITH SO IRN  STICKES SM DINNER
1611,THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET,OTHERMAGIT BECAUSTHE IRST MAGNT
1612,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER,GUM STGATHERD
1613,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE TH THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T G ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,TE CANTRAPT TRO THINGS NOT LIK CAIRBORDCDATRACT TOE COULD ATRACPT O SOMTHING PEASE PAPER SOMTHING LIKE THAT
1614,WE HAVE PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK S STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ONTO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT,WEPUTTHE BOON I THE TOOK STEL SHAVNGS AND HA CUMPEST TRY TO FINDM OTHER PEOPLECASTHE FRAGMENT R STICKAP ON TOO THE BOK YO HA TRY TO FINDT
1615,GOOD,GOD
1616,YEAH SOMETIMES,SUTIMES
1617,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND M ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY BY LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW,THE PAPER YOU CAUD FINDTRD FELL HAV YOU BECAS YOU WAL NE TH TH MAGMENT WIL BE REALLYLOASE NSID I YOUR MELOWS
1618,TTRACTED EACH OTHER,TD EACHATHER
1619,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNETS RUBBED ON TH THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNE IT MAKES IT M A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THEY WILRIP BECAUS SANTS TH MAGNAT RUB DOWNTHETH A ZOTH SANS THE RUB TO GETHERTHAT MAKSKS A BID MAGMATICETIT N PIKUP THE PPER
1620,IT IT STUCK ON ONTO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK T AS WELL,IST RON THEM A WHEN THEY LOOKED NEW THE ELDER OND STICKAS WL
1621,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,A THEWE FOUNDOUT WE WD CUM TO GETHER WITH AOMENTS
1622,THEY'RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER,THA SOUBTRACTIN EACH OTHER T  M TGETHER
1623,THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER,THEBTRACT EATCHOTHER
1624,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS A MAGNET,OMTHING CAN'T STA LIKE THAT SOG
1625,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STAY LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD,WTHE GEATHERLN OT AROUNDIF THEY DIDN'T STICK D
1626,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN,SESS ONLY FRWHILEBECAUS IT CAN'T STA LIKE THAT
1627,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS SO FIND AND YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN,TH MAGMEN YOU CAN FID YOU CAD START CLOTSERPINTS A DIFRNT WAYTER YOU GTTE TORDS THE OTHERTHS MAGMETS  YOUDINNER

1657,WE HAD HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE CHARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY,RAPBCAS WE   O WE STARTEDAD WHENT TNTH THEIRTE MNT O BECAUSE WE D HA A ATER F IT
1658,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT,OR BALTIRS WILL GUM UP
1659,IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SWIT SWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND TO MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT THERE IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AGAIN,A THE  S GOINGLOING TO THE OTHER SIDIT GOSIS B RAUPD AROUNDVR  BAC DOUN INSA BUS U
1660,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MINUS SIGN WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY A LITTLE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND TO PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRY TO PICK THEM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,HAD THE BATERY AND ON BIY  SIGH WE ADL WE HAD A COECTI THE SWICHER AND WE HAD A RELLY LOLNG LAER COECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE ATERR WI WE RAPED ROND THETOOK EHSID  PUTIT O THE SWICHWEIAS TRYD TO PIC THEUPAN SEE HO MNEY WE UTWED TRN A A

1663,YES,YES
1664,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL IS IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS A MAGNET WE WOULDN'T USE WE'LL NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOMETHI A SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PICK,MAKES IT SORE BEC E AR LAOO TRN APNOFTI VERRY IMPURTON BECAUS WITOT THE HOLL IELECTRIS DIF WE DIDNT AVE TATI WULDN'T HAVE SOM THING   EA SOMTHING FMONAND THE RE CON NEXT EVERY THING IN THE R W

1666,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND OUR HOU IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT SO WE DON'T TO TO PUT THEM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,THE SEAT IS TEAR SOR THET WE CAN TURN  AELPSED RABL TH MAGMENT WE HAVE A ATERRODSSTHE SWE IS THEAR FR T PICKTHE UP AND TURN THE UPEN DOWN WITHOUT HAVING RAN

1669,BECAUSE OF MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING MORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING IT A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE,BECAUS ARTHIS FLOING OARMIS FLOWING THROOW ADI BILIG MAKING A STRONGER MAET GOK GO ROUNDLL IT HAS R PIK OUPT
1670,WELL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO AS A MAGNET SO UM WE THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS,WEAP THE ITERRODTHE OUR TMES A WE ROPDRO THE STRONG TRNI AS AUR TMES WE ROPD ROTHE  MAGMENT WE N PICK UP

1672,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STONGER,WALTR ARE CUMING UP BECAUS ITS GETING STRANGER
1673,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET,WHE MAD AN ILLECTIRMAGN
1674,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET,TIAPT LIKE A NORMAL PEAS OF MATL INSTEDG
1675,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND IT HOW IT'S IT NEEDS TO GET AROUND THOSE WIRES,THE ENEARGY FLOWS THRWISHE PEAD O  ATER ATER
1676,I SEE THAT UHM THE WASHERS JUST GOT PICKED UP,I SEE WATCHIS JUS
1677,BECAUSE ENERGY MUST BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND ENERGY KIND OF I DON'T KNOW,ENERGY MST BD R JUCAS
1678,THAT IT LOOKS LIKE UHM THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY COOL AND UHM THERE'S ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT GOES OUT,THE ANEARGY STEAPS OOING THR THE WA RLLY CDN  ANOTHERGOS DOWN

1892,I'M GOOD AND HOW ARE YOU,I'M GDR YOU
1893,THAT THE PAPER CLIP WOULD WEIGH I MEAN GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP WOULD WEIGH MORE THAN THE OTHER THINGS THEY'RE WEIGHING IN GROUP ONE'S WOULD WEIGH UM LESS AG AGAINST THE OTHER THING,A THE PAPER LIP DI MEN GRU STET PAPE  OR THE THE OTHER THINGS T WI IN GRU D ARA GENST THE OTHER THING
1894,YES I THINK THAT WAS THE WAIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT,YES I THINK THAT WASI DBDON'TNO

1898,AND THAT'S KIND OF IT,HANDT
1899,GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP IS BIGGER THAN GROUP ONE'S SO MAYBE GROUP TWO'S PAPER CLIP WEIGHS MORE THAN GROUP ONE'S,R TOPPE IS BIGER THE   TOPLE WAS  THENA
1900,GOOD,GOOD
1901,MMM YES,G
1902,WE USED A,YE

1947,THE NEGATIVITY SIDE,TAGOVE IN
1948,I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,II'M REALLY GDBOUT YOU
1949,IT FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES GOING TO THE CASING OF THE BULB AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BULB GOING OUT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE MAKING THE BULB HAVE A CIRCUIT LIGHTING IT UP,GIN THE WATER GO INGT THE CAHES A NOTHE O CWITHE BOUGTEMBRAS A CIRCUSGETUP
1950,I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THIS,IO AROUND LIKE THA
1951,I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COURSE,IOS LIGTGFR
1952,THINK THAT IT WILL NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE NEEDS ONE TO BE AT THE SIDE OF THE BULB FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW OUT CAUSE IF IT'S AT THE BOTTOM THEN THERE'S ONLY JUST ONE BULB CONNECTING TO IT OR I MEAN WIRE,I THINAI WS NOT LIGHT UP BECAUS THER NEAS   BE A SIGETHNEARGYCAUS IF ITSE THE BOTEMTHER IS ONLY JUST ONE GRD C

1954,THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW IF THE ENERGY IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH OR NOT,THE FLOADG IS SPITING IS BECASETHE ENERGY IS ACHGING THROR A
1955,I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THAT OTHER METAL CONNECTED TO THE WIRE IT GOES BUT WHEN IT IS NOT AND IT IS SEPARATED IT DOES NOT GO,NTTHAT WHEN THE WAR IS CONECTED WIT THE OTHER MAELE COTHIT GOS W IIS NOTEPERATED
1956,MEANS THE THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY ABSORBING IT MAKING IT GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR,THLLL CONECTEING WITH SM INARGY AB ZORGHE WATERES TO THE MOATER

1958,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT,WE'VE BIN LNINGIUTHO WILL THEA CAO AK A BOD CIRCUTS
1959,WHAT MUST HAPPEN IS ENERGY MUST GO THROUGH THE WIRES GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT THE FLAG GO TO YOUR,ABHIS ENERGY MUST GO THRO THE WATER GOING TO  CIRCUS GOING TO THE MATERETET
1960,IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE A BATTERY YOU CAN OUT IN THE SUN AND THEN IT WILL GET AND THEN IT WILL GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN IF IT IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRE THE ENERGY WILL FLOW THROUGH THE WIRE TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BUILD IT FROM,IF YOU DON'T MATTER YOU CAN GO OUT THESLL WILL GETANER FROM THE S WTHE INERGEYL TH TH W
1961,YOU TOO,STUO
1962,THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING,AL

1969,IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP,TH THE IS ENARGY FLOWING FROM THE GET LIGHT UP
1970,THE SUN MAKES IT COME TO A REALLY SUNNY DAY MAKING THE SOLAR CELL ABSORB THE SUNS ENERGY GOING THOUGH THE WIRES UM CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO BUT IF IT IS A UM CLOUDY DAY THEN THERE IS NO SUN TO HAVE THE SOLAR CELL UM ABSORB ENERGY FROM SO IT WILL SO THERE IS NO ENERGY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES UM GOING TO THE MOTOR NOT MAKING IT RUN,CUM T VERY OAKING RB  THE WATR COUDING THE MALTDER IIF ITIS ATHIN TEIR S HAVE A SOLDER ELBOURMANRS THERS OTER GOING TO THE MDN AT NG GET ROU

2146,THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THIS IS A PALE CIRCUS
2147,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE AMOUNT IT'S GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS,TECFRMSIONS ALL ABOUTTHH EARTH MATRI AING SORDO IN GRABPUT THE CABOL IS I THEARNG BCATHE PAING SOO TAKES ATER VTD IS GOOD A ZOR BECASTHE CRAVEL CANATER IS   ONH AUWT SIDE PEOPLEIM SPUT THE PARING SOO I AB SORFOR THE PLAN
2148,GOOD,SUA
2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,I'M SOR DOESN'T CAMPARET TO HE GRAB IS MUCHIF  WATER THE STHE NOT MUCH BECAS THE SO H WATER GROW SOME CINT OF PLAN I THE GRABEL JUST LE FLOT BECAUS IT CAN'T VE ENEYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,SOYLE FROM THE GROUNDYOU GETE ROCK MTH
2151,WE BEEN,O
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,IOB ZEARE THATTHE  GETS STARTY WI YOU P WATER O THE GROVL
2153,I SEE WATER IN SOIL,I SEVE WATER NTHE OYAL
2154,YEAH,Y
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,IVI OB RISTANY WATER GETSOME SR CICKR
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,BCAUSTHE SORDIO CEAPSTHER WATER TITORITM CIN OF PLANWEDONT  AP WE THE DRAING D TO THE LARGGRAVEL CEAPS DOWNITG SLOLY BE CAUS HE HAS HORES
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,IMSORIN  WATER BECAS WE FIFTYLY THERTY FIVETHE GRA OU IS I SIRPSTL FIFTYTHE BE THIS COSTT FIFTYTHE SATER OAD IT CAN BE HELPM W E WE  O WATER
2158,GOT WET,
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,PUTYINGMY IFRMTION BECAIS PAING TO I GRASTHE PAUNGH SRO TAKES MY WATER BECASGROLDSJUST LIKE GO DOWNA
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WERA CRA WE PUT IT IN THE WATER IN THE FIVE MINTSAKS TO COWATER
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,WOR JUST LIKE THAT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I ABZERVE ING SOYO IS MUCH MR BETER THES UING SORIO YOU CAN YOUS ENY WA BECAS AB SORBE  WATERYAAR DOES NOTTHERAA BECAUS  WATER DN
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,ING THE ORGANISEWE YOU JUST AIOG SOYAB SORB  FOR HIS PLAN SAVE I THE GRAIT JUST APUT IT DO I TAKES THE WATER I LET THE WATER FLO DOWN THE BOTEMSR AM O THE GRAVLE DESNT BECASIT CAN GRO  AE TOO ARD YOU
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,TE ROCK AR HEVITHE WATERCASTHE LS T IS NOT YYOUD HAVE A R FOR THE WATER TO C SE GOS DOWN BECAUS  ONLY SOMA
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,I DOES RU D THE WATERT YODIT CAT ATERON THE TOPA ATERN THE BOATTERM
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,HEHA TO AN THE ROCKS WE PU WATERD THE WATER
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE CRAVL IS HIYGER I HAS MUCH WATERADTE  LKE JOP WATER I THE TOTE STOYL JOPLOR
2168,THANK YOU,YANKUE
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,I EUT AI YEAUT PINGTHEN GRAL BECAS H SAB SORBOR WATER T THE AL BECASE ONLY ROK  TUK THE WATERPATH AVL IF Y PDO
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,BECASIM SOME TMETHTH PARING SOO ITS GOOD  AB ZOURBING THE WATER GOS PLANTI GIVES YOUR PEUT THE GROVEL DOES BECAS AB ZORBES ARE READYE TO THE ROCKSTHETHE PARING SOO OP THE A METHE DRNBCASIT

2173,WELL THE GRA THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOIL'S WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT U ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS IT ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUGH,THETHE S ATERDUS GO DOUN BECAUS THE SOROE L SOMATER GE ON THE ROI GOS DOWN BECAUS THEIS OR N
2174,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GE AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'D BE GREAT,YOU  UPUTER YO A GO PLASES  BRING STP TO YOUR HOUSE N GONGET WATER I YOUR BG YOU SUB MITYOU CAN SEE HA MUCH WATER I THEA MOARIN THIS SAL WL BE GRATE
2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER DREENS WITHI THE GRALE BECAUS THE GRALE HAS A CODE BECAUSE  ROUCK INTHE REBLOAO THE WATER OUS DOWN THE REALLY SLOB A LOATERHE OREP IK
2176,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESN'T IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T UM WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON 'EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,WHE YOU PU ONT THE EARTH GO ON SOME MATERIELEDTKS A SME TRAPG DOTROK  ROK CAO P WATERTEATN ECAS IT HAS
2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOIOL IS MUCHI HAVE EARI THE CRAVEL BECAST TOR WATER IECASA DIDN'T IK  WATER SOYL I  WATERH RTER THIN THE A
2178,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN,IU THINK WAS GOING ON THE ING THEIRUD FANE IF I GAUGHT I SARFOM DIRTYC
2179,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER,E  JUST LIKE THATTHE SODIO MUCH MOR HEVIYR REALLYSIT TOOK THE WATER
2180,UHM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK,IM ABL JUST JUSTSEE BLACK
2181,UHM WELL UHM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE,T SIANG LIT DOESNT ACTHONS BOUT COAR IFT CUMSI
2182,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE,TURNS N IIS TO THA BLUELUEITIS BECSA C A BLUE FROM THE RAINGOCMR A BLUE CERNG BLUEPAJUSTBLU
2183,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BALL,STVERED OVER TH BLUEBOT
2184,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE,THE L REFLCTON B IS WHITE
2185,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT,NOTIS THEAT THER ISAWIE
2186,GOOD,T
2187,SO WHEN THE WHITE UHM LIGHT SHINING ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,WIN THE WIT LT SHADOW THE YELL YELLO
2188,WELL UHM THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL BECAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK IT JUST LOOKS BLACK,THE LITE YAR IS TURN AN RED GGPRBLUEBEL JUST LOOKES PBLUH
2189,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE,WALL ILIS THE SAME BECAUSS ONE REFLECTONTH BECAUSTHE YELLOBOLL IS SHEWINGB
2190,BECAUSE THE GREEN LIGHT IS GREEN,HGRMA
2191,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY UHM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL THEY ARE YELLOW,THE LIBRIS AR HEDON THE BOLLMWYEAO
2192,RED,RED

2194,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL,CTUN THEOTHERLET FROM THE YELLOB
2195,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT AROUND,Y THE RED CALLER CAN
2196,WELL SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB,S THE PICTURE ASAN
2197,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UHM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UHM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK,THE LIGHT ISI'M REDTHECARI' JUST RED  SEPT FOR THE BLUEB BLUEBOS
2198,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT,I'VE BENWRINGABOUT LATE
2199,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THAT COLOR TOO,WE HAD A C LISE ILTERD PAPER WI THE OTHER OBEN THE
2200,SO WHEN WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL UHM THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAME WITH THE BLUE SO ONLY YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BALL AND ONLY BLUE COMES THROUGH FOR THE BLUE BALL BLUE BALL,SO ONO M YELLOBOTHEO AN'T MW SPFR  CALLER O THE YELLO  LIKE A BLAERYELOW
2201,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UHM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT AS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW,IS REALLYA CARSOTH RIN  MIXTTTHER WHITETH GI CMS OUT WITH CLERRAN
2202,COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH,THE CALAR WIL SHIND THROU
2203,IT'S TURNING BLACK,TURNGO

2664,A COMPLETE CIRCUIT IS WHEN THERE IS UM WIRE THAT CAN GET AROUND FROM THE BATTERY TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND BACK AGAIN,A COMPLT CIRCUS WHEN THEIR ISA IN GET ROUND FROM THE BATTERYT THE ILLEC TRISTY RE SEVER B
2665,YOU CAN MOVE THE SWITCH SO THAT IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE SO IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR RUN AND IT WILL LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH,OU CA MOVE THSRI TUCH ING THE WAER WILL MAKE THE ANDLLT THE LE FL
2666,YES IT IS,YEL
2667,WELL A CLOSED CIRCUIT IS WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED SO IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT,WTHE CLOESIRCUSWN THE SWAG IS CLOTHE S ALETI THRO
2668,YES I DO,Y
2669,UM THERE'S AN OPEN SWITCH AN OPEN SWITCH THAT SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING,THER IS A OPEN SEN THA THE MOATER IS NOT
2670,IT IS A BATTERY AND A MOTOR BECAUSE THE BATTERY SENSOR THE S THE LONG LINE AND THE SHORT LINE AND IT HAS THE WIRES THE WIRES AND THEN IT HAS THE MOTOR UM AND IT HAS THE MOTOR,BATERY ANDE ATER BECASTHE ATERN T LOGD SHIRT LAS THE THE IT HAS TH MATER DE
2671,IT TRAVELS THROUGH A CIRCUIT AND IT AND THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GETS TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND THEN IT COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE SIDE AND THEN IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING,TRAVTRO A SCIRCUSA THELECT CMS FROM THE NEXT SIDE AND GET THEILEMS BACK THE
2672,IT IS A PICTURE OF A BATTERY AND IT HAS A CIRCUIT THAT'S GE AND THERE'S A SWITCH THEN IT'S GETTING INTO A LIGHT BULB,PICTURE BATTERYAND IT HAS A SCIRCUS HTTHER IS AWEO
2673,THAT THE WIRES ARE IN A CIRCULAR POSITION AND GETTING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND THEN BACK AGAIN,THE WARES AR IN A CIRCUL MUSISION GETING FROMTHBAUTERY TO THE MALTETHE A
2674,I'VE USED A SWITCH SO THAT YOU CAN TURN SO THAT YOU CAN LET THE ELECTRICITY GO TH SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE MOTOR STOP OR GO ON AND THE SAME WITH A LIGHT BULB MAKE THE LIGHT BULB GO OFF OR GO ON,WSURN SIRA YOU CAN LIK THE LECTRI STARESSIR YOU CAN AKE TME STP GOON N THE SAMEO
2675,WELL UM WE'RE STUDYING HOW MAGNETS REACT TO EACH OTHER AND HOW THEY ATTRACT CERTAIN THINGS,TH  A STAINGAATEA CHATHER  THA  ZARTA
2676,NO,
2677,BECAUSE IT E DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT,OO DOESN'T HAVE IRONS AR STELE
2678,REPELS FROM THE OTHER MAGNET AND WILL NOT LET THEM COME NEAR AND THE TWO ON THE TOP ARE ATTRACTED ALSO,FROM THE OTHER MAGMENTBEN THE TOP ARGAE
2679,GOOD,O
2680,LE IS MADE OUT OF IRON,T SOL IS TA OUT
2681,NO THEY'RE NOT,Y
2682,AND,CHAR
2683,NEGATIVE MAGNET WHICH MEANS THAT IT,MAGMET N
2684,THE TWO MAGNETS ON THE BOTTOM ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER SO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER THE ONE THE MAGNET IN THE MIDDLE IS S,TMAMS  R OTHER STICKR FRAGMENT IN THE ME
2685,IT SHOWS A MAGNET PICKING UP THE METALS THAT IT'S THAT IT IS ATTRACTED TO,SA A AG NIGHT PGUP MAOWS IF IT A CROUCLT

2687,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY,MABGMATISON IND LETICTY
2688,I'M TRYING TO THINK,IMAGEY
2689,BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IF THERE'S TWO THAT GIVES UP GIVES OFF A LOT MORE ENERGY SO,BCAUSBECAUSER WT GVE GIVES OFFH A MENAGY
2690,MMM HMM YES,BNORMAL
2691,W WE DIDN'T QU WE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH TIME WE WERE TRYING MANY MANY THINGS AND THEY JUST WEREN'T RIGHT SO WE R RAN OUT OF TIME,DIDN'T IGHT HAVE TIME WE WER TRYING MY Y THINGS  THE
2692,A SERIES,TERA
2693,UM WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE WIR OR TWO OF THE LIGHT BULBS AND YOU CONNECT THEM WITH ONE WIRE OR TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT'S DIMMER YES YES WE DID,YOU TAKES  TW TLIBOI CONECT WITH NE ERR TWO THER
2694,A D CELL AND UM IT'S A ENERGY SOURCE YES MMM HMM,I'M BT A NERGY SORTIS
2695,THREE,E
2696,ONE,WHT
2697,OKAY YES UM TODAY WE WERE WORKING ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO WIRES AND YOU CONNECT IT TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO OTHER WIRES AND YOU CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER WIRE SO IT HA GIVES YES TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND IT GIVES OFF A BRIGHTER LIGHT,A PARRL SCIRCUS IN THA SERIOSIRSAAL CIRCUSIS IHA ONE BATER YOU K TOO ATRS NY CONXT ON PB YOU TK TOO OTHER WATE CONXT A NOTHER GIVES OATER LATE
2698,MMM NOPE WE DID CONDUCTORS CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT UM ENERGY WILL GO THROUGH,ED COND CON DUCTERS AR THINGS A I EI
2699,THE LIGHT GOT VERY DIM,THEEA VERY SOON
2700,YES,YES
2701,A WIRE,
2702,IT HAS TO IT HAS TO GO IN A CIRCLE FOR IT TO ACTUALLY GO OFF YES UH CONNECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IF LIKE IF THAT ONE DIDN'T CONNECT TO THAT ONE IT WOULD NOT GIVE OFF ENERGY BECAUSE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'LL GO UP INTO THIS ONE AND LIGHT IT UP AND THEN IT'LL GO OVER TO THIS ONE LIGHT UP AND IF THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THIS ONE JUST WOULDN'T LIGHT IT WOULD BE ALL BY NO,LR CONECTIONS AR IMPOURTEN BECAUSEFTHAT MITHIN COCTDA  YOUT WILD O  OFO LITO THAT WAS INT I B O
2703,WELL WHAT'S GOING IS THIS IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP AND THAT IS GIVING OFF THE D CELL IS THE SAME ONE IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE SO IT MAKES IT LIGHT,THIS IS GIVENG A OPP SAME ONSCALD OFY
2704,IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY WERE ALL THE SAME LIGHT L YES YES,WASTILL THE SAMIWAS JUST THE SAME THING W ALL THE SAME LIGTE
2705,I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE THAT,I THINK IGALS LIKE THATHAT
2706,YEAH,YELLOW
2707,UH NOT REALLY,N REALY
2708,WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS THAT WHAT WE TRIED DID NOT WORK CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD WORK THAT THAT WOULD WORK BUT IT DIDN'T CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THOSE HAD TO CONNECT BUT NOW THAT I'M LOOKING BACK ON WHAT I DID I THINK IT DOES NEED TO CONNECT,WH SERPRIE ME ST WE I THOUGHTBCAUR IN TIN NOI LOOKING BAG DID
2709,TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE MISS DUNN TOLD US THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE THIS,MY STUM OSME TOOTH BAUTERYS  AK THIS
2710,NO YES WE HAVE MMM HMM,ABNORMALGEST WE HAVE
2711,NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED THAT THAT MEANS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY SO YES,BECAUSE IFE DOUR NOT CONECTD MEANS LO THAT WAY
2712,YES,
2713,AND THOSE ARE TH N N AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A WIRE THAT WENT THROUGH ONE OF THE METAL THINGS AND THEN IT WOULD GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE THE TWO WIRES AND WE WERE TRYING TO OUT THEM ONTO THE BATTERY SO IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS SO IT WOULD BE BRIGHTER,E AWAR TO BAS WE WR TRYING TO PUT O THE ATER LOOKE LIKE THIS
2714,WE QU DIDN'T QUITE FIGURE IT OUT YET WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO TWO LIGHT BULBS,E DIDN'T C FIGER YETWEWR THINKING ABOUT HAVEING CHEABOMS
2715,OKAY,Y
2716,BECAUSE THE BATTERY WOULD STILL GIVE OFF ENERGY AND IT WON'T AFFECT THAT ONE,BECAUSTHE MATTER WAS O GIVOF ENERGY
2717,YES,
2718,NOTHING,NOTHING
2719,WE WERE TRYING TO CREATE A CIRCUIT MMM HMM A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE PRETTY MUCH IT'S WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH ONE SIDE THE BATTERY GOES TO SOMETHING MAKES IT LIGHT UP OR RUN AND THEN GOES AGAIN THROUGH AND THEN IT'LL JUST MAKE A CIRCLE CIRCUIT YES NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS CAUSE IT CAN GO EITHER WAY OR IT CAN GO BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME,YWUD TRYIN TO CRAC THE CIRCUS ACIRTH ENERGEY G INSIDE G SOMTI LIGHTUP  A GODON'T THINKIT CAN G EATHERORI CAN GO BOTH DIRACTIONS
2720,WELL BECAUSE IT WAS SHARING OFF THE SAME UM WIRES AND THE WIRE COULDN'T N THE BATTERY COULDN'T PULL OFF ENOUGH ENERGY TO G THE WIRE TO GIVE TO THE BATTERIES BUT WHEN IT'S SEPARATE IT GIVES OFF MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE AND NOT OFF THE ONE,BECAUSE IT WAS CHING WPUL OFFO ENERGYTHE WIER GIVETOT BATTERIT GIVES OS ORONERGY BECAUS
2721,HAS TO GO BACK TO THE ENERGY SOURCE,WHS TO GO BACKTO THE NGICIO
2722,ONE,WHITE
2723,OKAY,
2724,OKAY,
2725,YES,
2726,YEAH,
2727,THEY DON'T WORK,
2728,WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES EACH BATTERY WILL BE A SOURCE FOR THE LIGHT BULB FOR EACH LIGHT BULB AND IT'LL BE BRIGHTER,BECASE YOU HAVE TOO BATERS MATER WILL BE A
2729,YES I CAN UM I CAN TELL YOU FOR ONE THING THESE ONES NEITHER OF THESE ARE PARALLEL BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM GO LIKE THAT AND THAT N ALL THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING SEE LIKE THAT,I CAN TEL YO W THINGTHE O NEATHER  A PARROLALBCAUS NEATHER OF THEM O LIKE THAT IN AOTHE WIS
2730,YES WE DID,AA
2731,YES WE DID,YE
2732,THOSE ARE THE WIRES AND THOSE ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,TS ARE THE RTOS
2733,TWO,TWO
2734,YES,
2735,WELL WHAT WE DID WAS WE JUST TOOK A BATTERY THERE AND THEN WE JUST DID THAT AND WE THOUGHT THAT THOSE WOULD MIX AND THEY DIDN'T SOME,UST SK ABOUTTER WE JUSTD A WE THOUGHT MT DIDN'T
2736,DIAMOND,DMA
2737,YES THEY ARE OPPOSITES THIS ONE IS NOT FACING THAT WAY SO THERE IS NOTHING RIGHT THERE AND THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT THERE WHICH MEANS THAT THE BACKS AND THE BACK OR THE PAH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BOTH THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND BOTH THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND ARE GOING THAT WAY NEGATIVE POSITIVE,THIS ON IS NOT FASING THAT WAY ME THE NAGETIVSDBOT YR LEG ISIDE AR THER  PAUSETIVSDARE WAY FROM EOTHER
2738,MMM HMM YES,ORGEST
2739,THE RECEIVERS YES,OSEN
2740,OKAY NO NOT AT ALL,NOMAL
2741,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATTERY'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO GIVE OFF TO THAT ONE IF THAT ONE'S BROKEN THERE'S NO ENERGY TO GIVE OFF TO THE OTHER RECEIVER,UTPOF INAGY THIS MOTHAT  BROKAN THEIS O INAGY RECEVER
2742,NO,
2743,WELL SAME THING IF IF SAY THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THAT ONE WOULD GET OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE BUT IF THIS ONE WEREN'T THERE THEN IT WOULD NOT GET ANYTHING EVE IF BUT IF THERE WAS A SWITCH HERE IF THIS WERE THERE AND I DID THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IT WOULD GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN IT WOULDN'T QUITE MATCH UP WITH THAT IF THAT WASN'T THERE AND THEN IT'S GONE,THAT WAS  ARN THAT WON LD GDFOASONE WLD NT THEAR WAS A SWEET YEAR IF THIS WR EBECAS EDONE GOS THRO EAR AMH
2744,YEP YEP,BOMAL
2745,WELL THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO TODAY WAS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE TWO OF THE SERIES UM CIRCUIT AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER THOUGH WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A CIRCUIT WHICH WOULD BE,THAUTS W WE WIR TRYING TO DDA ETRYNG TO E ERRIOS WEWR TRYING TO MAKE ITWE WR TRYIN TO MAKE THA CIRCUSTIC WILL BE
2746,YES S BECAUSE WITHOUT THE WIRES WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE UH ENERGY GO THROUGH TO THE BAT TO THE MOTOR OR THE LIGHT BULB,BECAUSE WITH OUT THE WAIRE WE WILL BE ABLE TOMAK THE ENERGY GO THRO TOTOTHE MOATER
2747,THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH THIS METAL BAR AND INTO THE OTHER UM METAL PIECE AND GOING THOUGH BACK TO THE WIRES AND INTO THE ENERGY SOURCE,THELECT IS GOING THRO THIS MADBTHROBTH
2748,YOU NEED TO HOOK THEM TOGETHER SO IT MAKES MORE ENERGY FOR THEM TO FLOW,EM TOGATHEI NAGY FOR THEM TO FL
2749,WELL THE WIRES UM CAUSE IT'S METAL TO METAL AND W THE WELL WHEN METAL AND METAL CONNECT THE BATTERY WILL GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THE WIRES THAT SENDS THROUGH THE COPPER INTO THE UM INTO THE LIGHT BULBS OR THE MOTOR,BCAUS ITS MAOWS TOMTOIN MES IN MEO TH BATTERY  GV ENERGY R THRO THE CLER IN TO THEMATER
2750,YES,S
2751,OKAY,
2752,YES YEAH MMM HMM,YAPH
2753,MMM HMM NO,N
2754,MMM HMM OKAY UH NO NOT AT ALL,CRONAM
2755,UH IT'S PATH,PASTH
2756,WELL IF THAT ONE GAVE OFF ENERGY TO THAT AND THEN IT CAME UP TO HERE IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU GOTTA TURN THE SWITCH ONTO HERE AND THEN E ENERGY GO THROUGH THE METAL AND GO THROUGH THERE AND THEN GO BACK,I THAT WON GRL ATHEN IT CAME   TH  THRO THE MEDOWGO
2757,UH THEN IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH BRIGHTER TWO YEAH LIKE THESE TWO THERE'S TWO HERE,NADO M MUCH BRITERLIKE THIS TAR  HARO
2758,MMM HMM OKAY,ARMAL
2759,IT WOULD GO IN HERE AND IT WOULD MAKE THAT ONE LIGHT UP,GOINUR
2760,CAN'T GO OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES,DOAN'T GOU
2761,PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AND OFF SWITCH,UOLSWACH
2762,UH WHAT WE DID WAS WE TRIED THAT ONLY THERE WAS A BATTERY HERE AND A BATTERY THERE BUT WHAT I WAS THEN THINKING WAS WELL THEN WHY NOT MAKE THE BATTERIES CONNECT CAUSE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE N TWO MORE WIRES AND CONNECT THE BATTERIES SO THAT IT WOULD FIT AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE OFF TWO ENERGY SOURCES BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTERIES CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCES WILL MIX AND IT WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER,TR TA ONLY E IS BI WS THEN THINKING AS ABI THI TORAIN C CD HET BTER OFF TO RGYCWHN THE BAI CTHE ENERGIY SORSES WILLR
2763,BYE I WANNA SEE NO I HAVEN'T,BOUNY
2764,YES MMM HMM,GESH
2765,BECAUSE IT GOES IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT MMM HMM YES THEY ARE,BECAUS IT GOWES IN THE CIRCULES
2766,DEPENDING ON UM HOW MANY LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES YOU USE LIGHT BULBS PRETTY MUCH CAUSE IF THERE'S FOUR THEN THERE WOULD BE FOUR CIRCUITS,NING LIPL  RCIHERS FORT BE FO CIRCUS
2767,THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU GO AGAIN HERE'S THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT'LL GO DOWN PAR WELL,TAALPOBI THE NUL AM OURS LPO  G DOWND
2768,WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VARY FROM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO A REGULAR CIRCUIT,TELS ME ABOUT THE CIRCUSTHAAR VEY DFNAOIIS
2769,THEY DON'T WORK,MAR
2770,THE OTHER WAY,ATHERWA
2771,YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN,BECAUS THEY ARE NOT CONECTED  THIS ON
2772,WELL UM,WLAM
2773,GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES OUT,EROS IN
2774,PATHWAYS THERE'S UH THREE,PASTHR THREE
2775,OKAY,
2776,YES,YES
2777,YEAH,
2778,THERE IS NO CIRCLE OR CONNECTION THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING,THEAR IS CIRCLER CONECTIONTHE ENEARGY DOES NOT
2779,YES THEY GOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T BOTH USING OFF OF THE SAME WIRE SO IT GOT BRIGHTER,A PAK  BECAUSTHE WAR BT USIONG OF THE SAME WITERPRATR
2780,Y YEAH I THINK IT MIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEED THESE TO GO THROUGH HERE YOU ALSO JUST IT'LL FLOW BETTER I THINK,I THINK NICTE BECUSYOU NE BEAS GOS THRO HEAR YOU AL SO
2781,UM WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER BECAUSE EVEN IN THIS ONE IT GIVES OFF A LOT OF LIGHT BUT WITH THEY'RE TWO IT'D BE JUST LIKE THAT ONE IT'D BE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT,L I THINK A BE MUCH MUCH  GRITEREVEN IN THISOE IT GIVES OFH A OGTOFA TO
2782,AND THEN IT'LL GO AGAIN AND THEN AGAIN THEN,I'M THD  GOAN
2783,THAT ONLY WITH TWO OF THEM THAT WERE BRIGHT SO JUST LIKE THIS ONLY BRIGHTER,YWTWOHEMER JU LIKE THIS ONLY ARIR
2784,YES ONLY THESE WOULD PUT OFF MORE ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,YESONLY TEATS WD P OFPH R ENARGY
2785,GOOD,
2786,YES,YES
2787,A SERIES CIRCUIT OKAY YEP THEN IT'D BE LIKE THAT LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE A SERIES CIRCUIT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT,A STERRIOS CIRCUS WITH CRALIKE THATTHAT WILL BE A SERIOUS CIRCUSS
2788,OH YE WE TRIED THAT ONLY WITHOUT THAT,WE'SULD TRY THEAT AM WITH OUT
2789,I WOULD STOP HERE I'D GO THROUGH AND THEN I'D GO BACK AROUND,ISTAMGO THRO  BACKGROUND
2790,YEAH PARALLEL,PARLEW
2791,YES MMM HMM,GESH
2792,UH YOU NEED THE WIRES MMM HMM,WIRES
2793,WE ACTUALLY DID IT WITH THREE LIGHT BULBS WELL WE ALSO JUST WE JUST TAKE ANOTHER ONE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST KEEP ADDING ON ADDING ON ADDING ON,WEV ACTLYD  WITH THE REEE WEVE JUST TIKED AN OHER ON YOUS ALN
2794,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S UM SURE WELL I'M GONNA DO IT IN A CERTAIN FORM IT GOES LIKE THERE'S THE BATTERY,THAT PLAY THE HE CIRUS WITHS WILL I'M GOD DO IN  RO MR
2795,OKAY,GY
2796,YES A SPONGE IS NOT A CONDUCTOR,SPOOS IS NOT CNDC
2797,BECAUSE IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE JUST LIKE THESE ARE ENERGY SOURCES,BECAUSE  ISN'TY OJUST LIKE THE ARRUS
2798,SEPARATE UM MEANS THAT THE WIRES DON'T TOUCH,SEPERITMAN THE WATRES DON'T TAUCH
2799,BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT METAL IF IT'S SAY UH SPONGE IT WON'T GO THOUGH BECAUSE WHEN METAL GOES THROU WHEN ENERGY GOES THOUGH METAL IT GOES THROUGH QUICKER AND IT DOESN'T UM IT JUST GOES THROUGH A LOT QUICKER BECAUSE IT IS WELL,BECAUSE IT IS NOT MADE IF ITIT DON'T GORBCAUSTA WHETH ENERGY GOS TO MA IT GOES ICERND IT DSN'TER BECAS
2800,YES,Y
2801,NO,NML
2802,THE EXTRA THE EXCESS YES THE ACCESS WIRE,IS PETURES
2803,MMM HMM YES,E
2804,YES UM,SAB
2805,YES MMM HMM YEAH TODAY WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE AND ELECTROMAGNET MMM HMM THAT IS WHERE YOU MAKE A MAGNET WITHOUT USING A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET,SZAVBER TRY TO MAKE AN ILLICTREFMADTHAT IS WHEIR YOU MAKE A MAGMET WITH OUTT
2806,YES,YES
2807,THEN WHAT WE DID IS WE TOOK THE UM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU CALL IT BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S METAL AND IT HAS A LITTLE TOP A LITTLE ROUND TOP AND IT HAS THREE PLASTIC OR RUBBER CIRCLES AND SO WHAT WE DID WE W WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND IT AND WE COVERED THIS LITTLE RUBBERS AND THAT WORKED MORE BECAUSE IT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY IT WORKED BETTER BUT IT WORKED A LOT BETTER IF WE COVERED IT AND SO WE WOULD WRAP IT EACH TIME WE'D WRAP IT TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND IT WOULD PICK UP MORE AND MORE OF THE LITTLE SN WASHERS,THETOOK THETHREWE ROPED THE WATER A ROUNDITND WE CERDTHETHA WIRDS MOR BECASUR BTERD A EATCHE TIME WE GRUGHT THE TITER N TR TR PIK
2808,MMM HMM AND TWO ON THE SWITCH YES CAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO S FOR ONE TO GO HERE AND AND THEN THERE'S THAT AND THEN THERE'S THAT SO WE STICK IT IN THERE,BCAUSE AS AVE ST ONEGOHERO
2809,YES,YS
2810,THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH THERE INTO THE THE NAIL AND THEN GOING JUST PICK UP THE WASHERS,THE ILEC TICODY WAS FLOWING THRO THE IN TO THEGO

2824,LIKE THOSE BIG BATTERIES ABOUT THAT BIG LIKE THOSE ONES YEAH OF YOU PUT WIRES ON THOSE BACK UP AND IF YOU HAVE A SMALL LITTLE LIGHT BULB SAY GOODBYE SO,YOU PUT BATHERS ON THE BAKUPIF YOU HAVE A SMOK IG STK
2825,THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE CRANE YEAH GOES INTO THE MAGNET AND MAKES IT ELECTRIC MMM HMM AND TURNS IT ON YEAH,THE ILLECT SDE FROM THEFROM THE GRAYNG BIEAGOS IN THE MAGET AND  DON
2826,YE UH NOT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IT WAS LIKE A MONTH AGO AT LEAST,BLWEKSAGO IT WAS LI A MONTH
2827,WELL IT WAS STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ENERGY IT CAN GIVE,BECUS  YOU ROLPED ROUWND THE  ENERGY
2828,WELL I'M NOT SURE BUT I WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET WITH TWO BATTERIES,IR FORWARD TRYNG TO MAK AN LRAHMNT WITH
2829,UH YEAH YES WHEN WE TOOK SO PRETEND THIS S IS A BIG LITTLE RECTANGLE THING OKAY AND HERE IS THE SWITCH SURPRISES IS THERE ARE LITTLE THINGS WHERE YOU PUSH DOWN AND THE WIRE GOES THROUGH THOSE THINGS GOT REALLY HOT BECAUSE OF THE D CELL I BELIEVE BUT THAT WELL I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS THAT THE D CELL WAS GIVING OFF SO MUCH ENERGY TO THE UM TO THE SWITCH BECAUSE IT WAS ON OFF THE THE SAME WIRE SO THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT BUT IT STILL WAS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR ME YES YEAH JUST LIKE THAT HEATER NO I'M NOT SURE IT'S BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE AN END LIKE THOSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE AN END IT DOESN'T PER SWAY AS MUCH ENERGY SO I DON'T THINK,EE TOOK AND THIS ISHER IS THASRPRISER THINGS PUSHD DOWN N THE BAGRTHOS THINGS GUGHT RELYHOTCASF THE DE SELL BLEI THINK W GOING O THE DEE SELL  GVENG O SO MUCH ENERGY TOIS BECASE IT WIS O OLPH THE SAME WATERCYOU DOESN'T HAVE AN A DSN'T PR WAY S MUCH INERGY
2830,YES YES THAT'S WHY THEY ALL WIRES HAVE THAT AROUND THEM,THATS WTHE ARWAORES HAVE THAT AROUD
2831,YEAH PRETTY MUCH,RYMACH
2832,YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TOUCH IT,AS WY O DON'T
2833,YES,YE
2834,YES THERE IS HEY LOOK THERE'S BARS LIKE GOING UP YEAH IT DOES,WHE LOOKED  BARIS LIKE GOING
2835,WRAP IT,WAPED
2836,YEAH I CAN AND,EGPIN
2837,IT WAS COMING FROM SO THEY'RE LIKE THAT RIGHT SO THE ONE'S COMING HERE AND ONE COMING HERE AND THEY COME TOGETHER,IT WAS COMING FROMER LIKE THAT ONTH MHRE
2838,I SAW THE LITTLE THING GOING UP AND DOWN,THI LEADER PE IN ON UP YOUR SA
2839,AND THEN IT WORKS GOOD BUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY STRANGE WAS WHEN RIGHT AS WE OPENED IT IT WOULD STICK FOR LIKE A MILLISECOND AND THEN IT WOULD DROP IT'S BECA WELL I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE UM MY FRIEND SHE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD BECAUSE IT NEEDS A W IT TAKES TIME FOR IT TO N GET THE NOTICE TO STOP I GUESS,I THOUGHT WAS REALLY STRANGE WHEH WI STICKE A MELO SEISBCASMYFREND SHE TOLD ME IT TAKES TIME FO GET H NORTES TO STAP
2840,THE OTHER TWO ENDS GO ON THE ENDS OF THE SWITCH,THE OTHER TWA
2841,MMM HMM YES I DID,PATHETIC
2842,ALL WE DID WAS WE HAD THE D CELL BATTERY AND NOW THE WIRE WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT CAUSE IT LOOKS UM THE ENDS INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE LIKE THAT IT HAD TWO SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE STICKED TWO OF THOSE ONTO THE BATTERY WE STICKED THE OTHER TWO TO THE SWITCH WE HAD A SWITCH TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THEN WE TOOK THE UM,HAVE A EELETHE WAER WAS ALNBE CA LOOK IN STETOF HAVEING ONE I   R  TWO TOS TICK THE OTHER TWO TWEHOOK
2843,IT WOULD GO UP,HE WALGP
2844,IT'D BE EVEN EVEN STRONGER,EVEN

2846,MMM HMM IT WASN'T METAL,AMA
2847,YEAH,R
2848,OKAY,
2849,YES,S
2850,UM IT WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF WIRE THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE IT WAS A A QUADRUPLE END AND IT WAS SEE THROUGH ALMOST IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT IT'S LIKE THAT YES IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT YEAH YES IT WAS REALLY WEIRD MMM HMM IT WAS LIKE A COPPER I BELIEVE COPPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,A RO CINDS OF WATERN WE'VE EVER SEEN BE FOURIT WAS A U HIT WAS EZAR LIKE THATM LIKE THATH S REALLY  A CO
2851,NOTHING IT JUST WOULD ONLY PICK UP ONE PRETTY MUCH,NOTHINGCU ONLY EP
2852,YES YES,OB
2853,THE PLASTIC IS THERE TO PROTECT YOU,ASSEEDECTURE
2854,IT WORKED REALLY GOOD WE WERE ABLE TO PICK UP FIFTEEN SMALL LITTLE WASHERS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNET,WE WR ABLE TO PAIKP FIFTYN SMOLLER WATERS
2855,YES AND THEN THE X,ACT
2856,BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THE CIRCUIT IT HAS STILL HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF ENERGY AND WHEN IT GOES THERE AND IT LETS GO IT STILL HAS ENERGY AND THEN IT STOPS THE ENERGY SAYS OH WAIT WE NEED TO STOP,BECAUSIR ASSTELT HAS A HORB OF YR INARGYD WHEN IT GOLSHIELL HAS ENARGY
2857,ANOTHER THING DID SURPRISE ME WHEN WE TOOK THE UM WHAT CAN I USE,UOINGIPRICED MWHEN WE TOK THE
2858,NO YES,NORMAL
2859,TO THAT BALL YEAH AN ELECTROMAGNET,TOO THATBOLECT
2860,YES I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD PICK UP SO MANY JUST BY TIGHTENING IT AND MAKING IT MORE AND MORE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT,DNTT YOU CAULD PIC OUP SO MANEY JUST Y
2861,YES IT'S REALLY BIG IT'S IT'S UM I THINKS IT'S EITHER A VERY POWERFUL MAGNET OR AN ELECTRO I'M NOT QUITE SURE,RELLI THINK AITS EATHER AR VERY PAEFUL MAMEONT SURE
2862,IT'S STRIPPED,STRIPE
2863,YEAH I WAS SURPRISED ABOUT THAT YES YEAH I WAS STILL A LITTLE SHOCKED ABOUT THAT THOUGH MMM HMM,I W PRED ABOUT THATI AS O LE CHOCKED ABOUT THE TUM
2864,YES,YES

3304,I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS,TTHE SOLDIEROS INTO THE WATER  THE WATER VAPERATET CRISTOLES
3305,SOLUTE IS WHERE ONE INGREDIENT THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVENT,WIUR YOUAL ONETH SIRVN DESARVES AN NOTHER I
3306,IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LOSE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH,IT TELLS YOU THINGS DON'T LEASE HOW MUCH THE WA
3307,THE MASS IS GROWING,HASSGROWIN
3308,THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE,THENO ITRIS A ELUSION SANTAOARMIXTURE
3309,THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER,HSATH WATR
3310,THE SOLVENT IS THE IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS,THE SEIRVAND  WATERD WILLZRA SN
3311,WE CALL THE THING THAT'S DISSOLVES IS A SOLUTE,WE'E C THE THING THATADRIA STO U
3312,THAT THE SOLUTE DISSOLVED INTO THE SOLVENT TO MAKE A SOLUTE SOLUTION,ATHE ZA U DE ZARVED IN TH ZARVIN TO AKEA SILLUTION
3313,IT'S A GOOD WAY TO SEPARATE THEM,ITS A GOOD WAYTERIN
3314,THE THE,THE SO EAT THESO SO
3315,I SEE THAT THE SOLUTE IN THE MIXTURE STAYS IN THE COFFEE FILTER WHEN THE SOLVENT THE WATER RUNS THROUGH BACK INTO THE CUP,IETHE MIXSTURE STAS IN THE COFFYSR WATERBTEA
3316,I DON'T KNOW,IDON'TNO
3317,THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM ONE IS A SOLUTION,THE COE IS A MIXSTURE IN THE BOUTTEMLION
3318,AS THE MONTHS PASSED DIFFERENT THINGS ARE BEING PUT ON THE BIKE FIRST THERE WAS RAIN WHICH AND THEN THERE WAS SNOW WHICH MADE THE BUS BIKE,AHE MONTH PASST S EFRN THINKSPFURST THER WS  THEN THIS WAS  NOLICH MAD THE B
3319,THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLED,THE T CILLUSIONA A CURMCL REACTION BES ILLUSION
3320,ONE CUP HAS NOTHING IN IT AND THE OTHER HAS WATER IN IT AND THEN THERE'S A SPOONFUL OF BAKING SODA AND A SPOONFUL OF CALCIUM CHLORIDE NOTHING IS MIXED TOGETHER SO THERE'S NO MIXTURE OR SOLUTION,ONECOB HAS NOTINTHE OTHERAS WATERPOONFULOA ISPOONFUL INOTHING IXATHER THER IS  PIXTURELS
3321,THEY ALL LOOK DIFFERENT,OA
3322,THE ICE CUBES ARE FLOATING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FOGGY,AR SCREPES OF FLODN TON THE TOB BECAUSETHEY WILLSA THE WATER I TIN
3323,BYE,
3324,REACTANT,REACT
3325,WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM,THE OO MIDL ISPS THE R
3326,I'M DOING AWESOME,I'M G AWE SOME
3327,A SOLVENT,SOTAN
3328,THE TWO THINGS WERE ADDED TOGETHER WHICH MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION AND THEN THE THEY IT WENT BACK TO REGULAR CLEAR,THE IN ALERD TO GETHER WI A A CA REACTIONN TEN THTA WENT BACK THE RED
3329,I DON'T KNOW HELP ME,YSING
3330,A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES,AU REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BEUSTHTOARBLS
3331,A PRODUCT,PRODOUCT
3332,THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM,THE TW TINS AR BEING PATHER TO GETHER TO MA
3333,NO I DON'T THINK A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED,IDON'T THIN REACTION SPING
3334,SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THE BAKING SODA OR SOLUTE WAS ADDED TO THE VINEGAR WHICH IS THE SOLVENT MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CREATED UM GAS UH YEAH,HPEN THO N WAS AD GER WIH IS H SOPE MAD A CMCL RE ACTION WICSHI CREATED
3335,THE CARBON CARBONATED WATER WAS ADDED TO THE CUP AND AS IT WAS BEING POURED IT WAS FIZZING AND THEN AFTER A WHILE IT STOPPED FIZZING,THEARN NATED WATER WAS AD TO THEA A WAS FI
3336,THE ICE CUBES FLOATED TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS DENSE AND THE THEIR WAS STUFF ON THE SIDES OF,THE AICRUE FLODD FOM THE TO EBECAUSE THEY WILL  STAPSND EAR WAS
3337,THE WATER IS GAINING UM MOLECULES FROM THE ACID,THE WATER ISSCTRAYWNINGBODO FROM THE CAULTRI ATSEED
3338,YES THE UM SOLUTION HAS BLUE MOLECULES FROM THE VINEGAR AND WHITE MOLECULES FROM THE BAKING SODA AND GREEN MOLECULES WHICH REPRESENT GAS,THE ILLUSION HAS BLUEE MONAC FROM TH VETGOD WHITE MONA FROM THE MACING SOAND GRA MONA WITH REPRESENT
3339,A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANTS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER,REACTIONS NOT TAKING PLACE BECUSMORTHNREACE  TGETHER
3340,WE CALL THESE REACTANTS,WE CLL THE RIEACTIONTS
3341,A LOT OF THEM KEEP THEIR SAME PRODUCT,Y OUGT FEMET THE SAME PROTOP
3342,CONSERVATION,COULTEVATION
3343,UM IN IN CUP ONE CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING SODA WERE MIXED CUP TWO CALCIUM AND CITRIC ACID WERE MIXED AND IN CUP THREE BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID WERE MIXED AND NOTHING,AH CLORAT BN  MIXTU T  CORT AND SIWE  MIXTU AR E SOTA IND SI  MIXTADNOTHNG
3344,SO THE BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND WATER ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER WHICH FORMS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND AFTER A LONG TIME UM PRECIPITATION IS LEFT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP,THE THINKINGTHE COS LOS I BATER BEING MIXTHERWICH FORMS A CL REACTION  A A LONGTMTEMPTATION IS LE BOTTEM
3345,IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE EARTH WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE EARTH AND NOTHING CAN DISAPPEAR OR BE MADE,BECAUS EVERYTHING ONTHE EARTH WILL ALWAYS BEHEEARH NOTHINGMAD
3346,RECENT,R SENTS
3347,LEARNED ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW IF CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FORMED OR NOT,HFUMCL REACTIONSNA
3348,I NOTICED THAT UM THE VINEGAR HAS BLUE AND YELLOW MOLECULES AND THE BAKING SODA HAS WHITE MOLECULES AND THE UM THE PRODUCTS HAS BLUE WHITE AND GREY MOLECULES,I O AO AS BLUE IN YELLOW MONACTHAT I ING SOA HA WHITE MONACD BLUE WHIT EN GRAY MONC
3349,YES A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED CAUSE ADD THE WATER AS THE WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE A IT'S CAUSING RUST WHICH IS A CHEMICAL REACT,HMREACTION ISGCUSTHE WATER HAS THE WATER IN SNB AING RUSTWIS I RE
3350,IT IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANT TO BE ADDED,NOREACTION BECAS  WAS T REACTEDED
3351,I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING DID ANYTHING ONLY THE ICE CUBES WERE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER SO THEY FLOATED,DON'T THINK THE ART CAN OK REACTIONOTHINGLYTHE ICECUE  MORDIONS FROM THE WATER
3352,ALL OF THE MOLECULES IN THE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT THE THE UM,I' LIKE M MONACTOTHS WIN THE DNFRNTTHNKI
3353,I THINK A SOLVENT IS MISSING,I THINKAPA
3354,NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER,BECAUS HAVE A CUCOL REACTION YOU HAVE T HAVE WATER
3355,WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE,BESOTA IN  CACOU ROT
3356,YES A CHEMICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FOLD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDICATES A CHEMICAL REACTION,UREACTION HAS BN TABECAUS YOU LWC INDACATESREATION
3357,I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME,I DON'T PLEASE HEP M
3358,CHEMICAL REACTION,REACTION
3359,THE CITRIC HYDROX AND HYDROX ACID ARE ADDED TO FIFTEEN MILLILITERS WATER WHICH FORMS A SOLUTION,I NT I ATED FIFTY MILEADERS WATERWICH FARMS A LLUSION
3360,WELL THERE ARE NO BUBBLES AND THERE WAS NO CHEMICAL REACTION BUT WHEN THEY ADDED TOGETHER THEY THE SOLUTION WAS PURPLE,WL HER NE BUPLES IN THER WAS  REACTIONW THE GATHERD TOGETHERILLUTION WAS
3361,REACTANTS,REACTIEN
3362,YES BECAUSE OF THE OF,YBECAS OS THE OVATION ACE
3363,VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA WERE ADDED TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY WERE ADDED TOGETHER THEY CREATED A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH BUBBLED,AKING TERAND WEN THE ART T GETHER THE CREATED A C RACTIONWPUPLE
3364,A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEEN HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WHEN THE GRAPE TASTE IS ADDED TO THE WATER,REACTION IS NOT B NOTHING IS HAPEN  THEAST IS
3365,WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE WHICH MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH ADDS RUST TO THE BIKE,WATER AN THE SNO AR BEING ADED TO THE PUEI MS L REACTION WITH
3366,CAN BE SEPARATED,IT CAN COPERATED
3367,A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE GLOW STICK IS UM FOLDED IN HALF,HA CCOL REACTION I BEING MA AS THE GORSTICK ISVALED

3385,I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME,IPLEASE HELP MEA
3386,SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND,CREE SEPERATED THE WATER FROM THE SAND
3387,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURE,WE'VE BEN LINAOUTH MIXSTURE
3388,THEY'RE BRINGING MIX TOGETHER,THER BRANG MICT TO GEATHER
3389,THAT IS CALLED A SOLUTION,THAT IS A COLD CO VIELLUSION
3390,THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER,ASOD EV INTR THE WATER
3391,THEY'RE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATER,THEY TRAINING THE MARBLES OUTOF THE WATER
3392,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THEIR SAME PROPERTIES,THFRENS BETWEEN MIXTURNLUSION ILLUSION W ESBTH THEM THE SAME PROPRTY
3393,TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE PART NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OTHER,TO MAKE A TELUSION AR NEA A ES VID
3394,BYE,TH
3395,THIS IS A MIXTURE WHERE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES,THIS IS A MIXTUREEVERY THING EATS THE PROPERDY
3396,THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER,WYO'LL GET SEPERATED FROM YOUA
3397,THE MIX THE UM EVERYTHING MIXES TOGETHER TO MAKE A MIXTURE,H WILL YOU L THE M EVERY THING MICXTI T GATHER TO  A MIXSTURE
3398,THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES,DE ZALVES IN THE WATER WILL THE OTHER TO CKEAP THER NRAPDY
3399,THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE OTHER TWO ARE MIXTURES,SO WATER IS ILUIONTHE THER O MIXTURE
3400,IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE AND IT'S WHERE TWO OR MORE OBJECTS ARE TOGETHER,TIS CALD MIXSTURE  OBJECTSTTHER
3401,THEY WERE TAKING RAISINS AND M MS OUT OF THE NUTS,WILL AK IN VASE IN TH M D OUTO THER ATS
3402,I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER,I SENG SALLY  N WATER

3405,GOOD,GOO
3406,THEY'RE TAKING BACK THEIR OWN PROPERTY,TAKING BACK THEIR ON PROPERTY
3407,THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP WHILE THE WATER GOES THROUGH,THAT MARBLEBAL STAINKS ON TOPLL THE WATER GOWS THROO
3408,THE PILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE,THEBI IS A MIXSTURE
3409,BECAUSE THE GREY STUFF UM DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,S BECAUSE THESDE ZERTED INT THE WATTER
3410,SOLUTIONS CAN'T BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED AND THE OTHER AND IT CAN'T BE TAKEN OUT,SILLUSIONS CANT BE SEPERATED BECASONAS EZOLPED IN THE OTHERIT CABETACNOUT
3411,THE SAND STAYED ON TOP,OD SAT STA O THE TOP
3412,WE CALL THAT A SOLUTE,WE CAL HA SALLY

3414,THEY ALL KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES,THAY ALL CEP THEIR ON PROPERTYS
3415,THE SALAD IS GREEN,TH SOLLUER  GREN
3416,THE WATER GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE,THE WATERE GETS STRAIND OUTO THE MIXSTURE
3417,WELL IT TOLD US PARTLY UM WELL IT TOLD US THAT WE COULD COMPARE OUR ANSWERS AND WE COULD SEE WHO HAD THE MOST OF SAY C A B AND THEN IF VERY FEW PEOPLE HAD A C B THEN WE WOULD KNOW THAT C A B WOULD WAS PROBABLY THE RIGHT ANSWER,TOLD USARLE TOLDUSWE CUD COMPA ANCSER ND WE C SE HO HAS THE MOST O THE ZE VERY FEOU PEOPLE HAS A E WE WDHE ZIER  IT
3418,WELL WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND THEN WE TRIED TO FIND OUT WHY AND WE CAME UP WITH MAYBE ONE THE TEACHER FILLED UP SOME CUPS SOONER SO THEY WERE COOLER AND THEN SOME LATER SO THOSE WERE HOTTER AND THEN ALSO MAYBE THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WAS DIFFERENT WITH THE SUN COMING IN FROM THE WINDOWS,WEAL GOUT DIFRNT ANSEARWE TRYED TO FIND OUT WHY AND BECAME OP WITHE TEATERM SONE THE S LADER ALS MA BE THE RU TEMTER ITH DIFRN WITH  SNWINDOWS
3419,YES IT WAS UM LIKE THIS,YU SUS ARM LIKE THIS
3420,WELL WE HAD THREE CUPS OF WATER AND FIRST WE WOULD PUT OUR FINGERS IN AND ESTIMATE WHICH ONE WAS THE HOTTEST AND WHICH ONE WAS THE COOLEST AND THEN WE WOULD ACTUALLY USE THERMOMETERS,WE HAD THREE CUPS OF WATER WE D PUT OAUR FINGERS IN THEESTHWITTHEST WE D ACTHOL YNAUMADOS
3421,WELL IF WE DIDN'T KNOW THEM THEN IT MIGHT BE HARDER ONCE WE POUR THEM TOGETHER TO GET THE ANSWER,IF WE DIDN'T NO THEMEIT MIGHT BE HAIRDER WHEN S WEET  THEM TO GETHER ANCEAR
3422,OUR FIRST TEMPERATURES WAS B WITH THE ICE WATER WAS EITHER I THINK IT WAS ZERO DEGREES AND THEN WITH OUR WARM WATER IT WAS TWENTY ONE I THINK,OAUR FIRST TEMPTURES WLS BE WITH THE ICE WATER AS I THINK WI ZERO D GREES IH WI AUR ORME WATERAS TWENTY ON I THINK
3423,WELL IF YOU MIX THEM IT IT WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE ALL WELL IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE ABOUT THE FIFTY OR FORTY OR IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER BECAUSE WHEN WE DID IT WE GOT EIGHT DEGREES CELSIUS,WEL IF YOU MIXT THEM  PROUBLTILL BE AWELMYOUT TH FIFTY R FOURTYE OR  MY BE AUB LOER BECAUS WHEN WE DIDN'T WE GO EIGHT DE GREES
3424,WELL IT TELLS ME THAT ROBBIE GOT C A B BILLY C A B JAMIE GOT A C B AND PAT GOT C A B AND SO THERE ARE THE SAME NUMBER OF EACH SO THEY IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO TELL WHOSE WAS CORRECT,WELL IT TELS ME THE RUB BILLI R  B AN THE ARTHE SAME NOMBER   S IL ARDER TO TEL HOS WAS CURRECT
3425,YES OUR ANSWER ONCE WE MIXED 'EM SURPRISED ME AND THEN UM ALSO WHEN WE COMPARED OUR ANSWERS WHEN WE MIXED 'EM WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND SOME PEOPLE HAD LIKE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES AND YEAH THA,YEAR ANER NWET SOM SURPRISE MEALSOWN WE CN PAD OUR ANSEAR WHE WE ALL HAD DIFRENT ANCERS INSOME PEOPLE  TWENTY EIGHT GREE
3426,WELL THE THERMOMETER HELPS YOU MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THINGS IT YOU WOULD PUT IT IN LIQUID OR YOU COULD HOLD IT IN THE AIR AND EVENTUALLY THE MERCURY INSIDE OF IT WOULD EITHER EXPAND AND COME UP THE TUBE OR COME DOWN AND THEN YOU WOULD READ THE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS,WILO HELPS THE MASD THE TEMPTURE OF THINGS W LICDR YOU CUD HOLD THE AL THE MIRRY IN SIDEOF IT WI THE DON  RDID
3427,UM WELL A AND C THEY'RE BOTH AT TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS SO THAT TELLS ME THAT THEY ARE TWENTY IS HIGHER THAN FIVE SO THEY ARE THE WARMEST AND B IS THE COOLEST,EAIGHE EIRBO TWENTY GRES SO SOTHT TELS ME THE ARTWENTY IS HIGHER THEN FIVE ZR THE AR THE ARMIST VICUOST
3428,YES WE ALSO RECORDED OUR MEASUREMENTS UP ON THE WHITE BOARD AND ALL THE OTHER TEAMS DID THE SAME THING AND THEY RECORDED THEIR'S TOO AND WE COMPARED OUR ANSWERS,WE ALL SO RECORDTED AR MEASERMENTS UPON THE WITE BOARD AND ALL THE OTHER TEEM TD THE SAM TINGPDA ANCSERS
3429,WELL THE CUP ON THE FAR LEFT LOOKS LIKE THE WATER IN IT IS VERY WARM BECAUSE IT'S FIFTY CELSIUS AND THEN THE CUP ON THE FAR RIGHT HAS ICE IN IT SO IT'S COLDER AND IT'S TEN CELSIUS,THE CP ON AR WEF LOOKED LIKETHE WATERIS VERY ORM BECAUS FIFTY SELICUP
3430,WELL THEY WERE EACH FILLED WITH UM DIFFERENT TEMPERATURED WATER SO B WOULD HAVE ICE AND THEN C WOULD BE WARMER AND THEN A WOULD BE THE WARMER AND THEN YEAH,WH THE FIELD WITHTHE TEMPTURE WATER SO E W HAVE  ICE IN THE SEEWL BE AMRTH A B THE RM
3431,WELL WE LEARNED THAT PARTLY HOW TO USE THERMOMETERS AND ALSO HOW TO MEASURE WATER WITH THEM,WE LIRN THAPUE HAVE I YOUSE TUR AULMADORS AND AL SO HAVR WATER WIT THEM
3432,WELL FAHRENHEIT IS HIGHER OR SO FOR EXAMPLE THE ROOM TEMPERATURE MIGHT BE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BUT IT WOULD BE UM LESS IN CELSIUS BECAUSE YEAH,WHL SARNI IS HIGHER OAR SILVER THE RUD TEMPETUR MIHT BE TWENTY EIGHT D GREE ERN BE A LES IN SELIOUST BECAS
3433,WELL IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE USED FAHRENHEIT WE WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND IT WOULD BE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO CONVERT THE FAHRENHEIT TO CELSIUS,IT S IPORTN BECAUS IF WE YOUST ANIT WE WILD ALL HAVE DIFRENT ANCERS IND CVIRTH ARNTIT
3434,I'M DOING GOOD,I'MGWNGGOOD
3435,HE IS USING HIS FINGER TO TRY TO SEE IF HE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT WHICH ONE'S THE HOTTEST AND AND THEN IN ORDER TO THE COLDEST,H IS YOUSING HIS FINGER TO TR TO SEE IF HE CAN FIGOUTW WI THEOTHE COLD
3436,YES BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD MORE ICE WATER THAN HOT WATER AND THIS LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIXTY DEGREES,THAT WAS BECAS WE HAD MOR ICE WATER THIN HOT WATER LOOKE LK MI BE SIXY GRFE
3437,WELL ESTIMATING IS KIND OF LIKE GUESSING IT'S WHERE YOU KNOW SOME HINTS ABOUT IT BUT YOU HAVE TO GUESS P ON PART OF IT,WLL ESTAMATING IS CIND OF L GEING WHR YNO SOM THINS ABOUT IT B YOU HAV A GETEPART
3438,WELL THE A AND THE C LOOK LIKE THE SAME TEMPERATURE AT TWENTY AND B IS THE COOLEST BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS,WHTHE ETHE SE LOOKED LIKE THE SAME TEMPTERE AT TWENTY S CLIST BECAUSITS ABOUT FIVE DE GREES
3439,UM NO WHEN I DID IT MY GUESSES WERE NOT CORRECT,H DIDENT MY GESES WR NOT COURRECT
3440,WELL CELSIUS IS THE METRIC SYSTEM WAY OF MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THINGS,WILL SEL IO IS THEAICK SISTME A OVF MASURING THE  TEMPTURE O THINGS
3441,PRISED ME,
3442,WELL AFTER WE DID THAT WE EACH GOT THERMOMETERS AND WE PUT THE THERMOMETERS IN EACH CUP AND WAITED UNTIL WE HAD THE MEASUREMENT AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT IT WENT C A B NOT A C B,AFTER WE WEE CUGT THER MAUMPTORS  WE PUTH S IN EAT CUP N ESNTLL WE HADE A BE
3443,NO IT WAS NOT,NO  WAS NOT
3444,WELL THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN LET'S SAY WOULD BE UP TO THE TOP SO RIGHT WHEN YOU OPENED IT IT WOULD THE SODA WOULD COME UP TO THE TOP,E SARDCAWILL BEO THE TOR WEN YOU OPEN TARA  AUP THE TO
3445,WE WOULD POUR IT INTO A CUP WITH MEASUREMENTS IN MILLILITERS WE WOULD MEASURE THAT AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH WE WOULD EITHER USE THE SYRINGE OR ANOTHER CUP,WE OD R INT A CUP WITH MATURMONTS IN LEDERI THAT WASN ANOF WE  SERIN FOR A NOTHER CUB
3446,WELL WE WERE DOING MILLILITERS AND LITERS SO WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SODA CAN'S CAPACITY WAS AND HOW MUCH THEY FILLED THE COMPANIES FILLED UP TO AND THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IF THEY FILLED IT TO CAPACITY THEY COULD GIVE YOU MORE,WEMIL LEADERSI LEADER TRYING TO FIGROUT WT THES PASD WAS IN HOU MUCH THE THE CUMPNE FELDH THREE HUNDED MILLDER TOOK A ASTHEY CD YOU
3447,WELL A WHILE AGO IN MATH WE WORKED WITH SODA CANS YES,WILAIL AGOTEWEE WIRKED WITH SARDACE
3448,WELL WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT THE COMPANIES WOULD DO THAT SO YOU WOULD BUY MORE BECAUSE YOU WOULD FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SO YOU WOULD COME BACK AND BUY MORE SO THEY WOULD EARN THE COMPANIES WOULD EARN MORE MONEY,WE CAME OP WITHTHE CUMPE   BYM AR BECAUS YOU L LIKE YOU DIDN'T HAV CUM BACK N'TY MONEY
3449,WELL WE POURED THE WATER INTO THE SODA CAN SO IT WAS FILLED TO CAPACITY AND THEN WE DUMPED IT OUT AND MEASURED IT,WE PUR THE WATER IN TO THE SOTACSEDAY WE JUMPTE DO AN  ESRD
3450,WELL MILLILITERS IS A METRIC WAY OF MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID SO THEY'RE PRETTY SMALL,WIL MILS IS A METCLA OF MASERYING THEAO LD SO THE PRETY SMARLE
3451,WELL IF WE USED OUR WAY OF MEASURING WE WOULD ALL HAVE GOTTEN DIFFERENT ANSWERS LIKE I SAID BEFORE AND IT WOULD BE HARDER,IF WE OUR WARING WE  HAVE GOUGHT IN DERNT ANCES LIKE A S BE FOUR NDIT WLLD BE HARDE
