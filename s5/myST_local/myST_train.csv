/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/002261/myst_002261_2015-04-06_09-57-13_LS_2.1/myst_002261_2015-04-06_09-57-13_LS_2.1_008.wav,so the one on the right is uhm the green one and so that was the one that uh you it's alive and it's tall it's the same height as the left one that's yellow and you can tell that it's not dead because all of the roots at the bottom they would be like brown instead of white so they look a lot they look the same height and everything they're just different colors so like the green one that was able to have the chlorophyll and the chlorophyll was able to bounce uhm bounce off of it and make it green like the reflection that it's supposed to have but for the yellow one the yellow one didn't get the chlorophyll and even though it broke its dormancy doesn't mean that uh it needs the chlorophyll and so i would think that that one was probably growing in a black bag because it couldn't get a couldn't have gotten the chlorophyll if it was in a black bag and the green one was either out had no bag at all or in a clear bag where it could get that chlorophyll

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/007073/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_021.wav,well it is the steel one because the other one isn't made out steel or iron so it can't stick that's why i will pick the steel iron nail and not the other one

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/007073/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_016.wav,because one nail is made out of steel yeah steel and the other nail is probably made out of copper so that's why it's the steel one is sticking to the magnet and the copper one isn't so that's why
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/007073/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_020.wav,the nail sticks to the magnet because it's made out of steel the other one isn't made out of steel so it won't be able to stick
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/007073/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_008.wav,well it's because we've been learning about that magnets in in class so now we're like a magnet expert

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/007073/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_022.wav,so what happens here is like the regular rock doesn't stick the aluminum nail doesn't stick and the washer doesn't stick either but the paperclip the steel nail and the river rock i think it is or the black rock does stick because it has and the little paper fastener and those things have steel or iron in it like the rock i thought it wasn't going to work but it actually worked because it had some iron in it so and i learned something new in science

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/007073/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_014.wav,so magnets stick to anything steel or iron and it could and but if it sticks to refrigerator because that's steel or iron but it sticks and some magnets stick to other magnets but it depends on what side because on some sides they have a force together and on a different side they stick together like attract and then the other side it's a force
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/007073/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1/myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_023.wav,when a gray rock touches the magnet it actually really depends because some of them do have iron or steel in it but some of then don't too so it really depends i think you would have to try it out as well so

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_064.wav,th so this is our s uh what uh this is our measuring tape and and then yeah we have our things on it so this is our measuring tape and um we have our our little launch pattern down here and it has a stick that hangs off of it with it's little things that hold it and then here is our square this was our greatest square this is our fifty and we had a push stick so we had our p stick pushing down on it all the way down here so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_044.wav,well that's what um we talked about as the basics and then um just controlling one variable at a time i think we changed all a lot of variables we wouldn't see what had affected it and we have a recording sheet and our recording sheet told us it asked us questions and everything and if we changed all the variables we couldn't answer those questions because we wouldn't know oh wait oh no that's that's how it is that's what affected it mass affected it not the an the brace affected it beh yeah
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_028.wav,so my test my basic or my uh or my or my variables test
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_076.wav,as we get bigger mass it's it's shrinking

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_074.wav,i would say uh to them if you look at it the mass does affect it and it affects it by mainly um it's kinda hard to explain cause i haven't done the full test yet but um
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_006.wav,you have a um tin foil and you ha it's twenty in uh centimeters long that is going to be one that's a basic uh that's an average um passenger

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_070.wav,it affects it how does it affect it um

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3/myst_993200_2008-23-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_084.wav,yeah yeah yeah okay okay so i'll just do that okay you're welcome thank you you too

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_020.wav,well at the end of our basic or our um standard was a penny so we added another penny onto it and yeah yeah at the end of it yeah we added another one and we dropped it and basically yeah the mass and yeah yeah so we went to the standard dropping point and we dropped it from there and well the mass didn't do any any
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_026.wav,the string s the small string did a whole bunch more swings than the larger swing i mean the larger pendulum so the larger pendulum did at least ten s uh five swings in fifteen seconds and i think that was because of the um just because the larger ones have to go a farther distance the it has to carrier a farther distance to go to to uh um to get one swing and the little ones kinda just had to go back and forth and the little ones were so easy because they they were not even uh a far part away so they just went up down up down did a longer string kinda had less swings cause it affected it more yeah the th yeah the fifteen i uh centimeter actually did twenty two swings which was a difference between our standard and the bigger one did less so that was the difference between our standards so that's kinda what we watched
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_030.wav,yeah s yeah the same the same one same s string um but so the ones like thirty and thirty five from that range those centimeters they they didn't really make a big difference they kinda went a little faster so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_002.wav,um we've been doing um well first we did ecosystems and we're done with that unit now um but now we're working on um on a pendulum which is basically um what is inside a grandfather clock and um well we measured speed well not speed but um we measured
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_036.wav,okay so there's from five to twenty two and then so here i would go one two two well um more sixteen to uh two hundred these are how many swings so swings and this is um more of how long it is so this is the centimeters so the centimeters um say we're doing the two hundred and the two hundred did did five swings yeah did five swings we drew down with a ruler and we just measured it and we went all the way down to two hundred and we drawed our pendulum so we drew our dot and it went all the way up to the littlest one that was like this and in between there's a whole bunch of them just like this and you could watch it went up a little bit some of them have to were were the same and then some of them went to some of the small ones did slower so so some of them were more over here than up here just because um sometimes when you drop it it hits something so we still have to count the swings between there but it doesn't matter if it hit something so it's kinda between that
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_008.wav,i mean um no i i mean not speed but um not speed but just how how many swings it should do so desk level would be where y w we taped the pencil to a desk or a flat surface and then you lined it up with that flat surface and if you when you drop it we have fifteen seconds and we see how many swings a swing would be counted as basically so say you started on the right side y you you you
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_050.wav,yeah yeah we did it a couple times and we finally got rid of the cluster so like once we got rid of the cluster it was a little better just because we could actually see more of what was on the graph and how more it w how it works a little better so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_004.wav,oh well we measured the w um the weight of the pennies that we put on the bottom of the pendulum and the and the um how many swings it does and weight distribution with uh desk level so like if y so the pendulum was made with um basically what we made it with was a pencil string a thirty two piece thirty eight piece string with um a paper clip hooked to the end of it with a penny on it
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_022.wav,what do you mean
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_046.wav,well we had a cluster probably because the well you kinda we have to do it on our desks and our desks are put together so it's hard to drop it without it hitting anything so um when we dropped it might hit something and it it just counts as a less swings so if you look at it it's gonna be less swings uh for the bigger ones like the the bigger ones some of them like the thirty eight and them
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_024.wav,well uh we wanted to test it just normal and then we would test it above and below our desk so we tried it and it still didn't get more swings it came out with the with the standard swings which was twelve t eleven to twelve so that didn't work we it the dropping point didn't have any effect the mass didn't have any effect so we tried it in all three places and it didn't have any effect to the pendulum so we um that was basically the just the thing that started so the next day so yesterday we tried different sizes of string and so there was string from six no fifteen centimeters to two hundred centimeters so the be the the um there was basically there was no there was a huge difference between the we eh the the string just because the larger string

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_032.wav,well we wrote all the answers on the board and it turned out that um the

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_010.wav,yeah

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993200_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_034.wav,everybody had to know what their string was like how big it was or how small it was they have to know how many swings that it each did and so we all went and wrote it on the board and then we made a bar graph a graph on the swings on and if you looked at it it kinda looked you'd look at the big ones and you'd see so it'd start with how many swings you do so say there's a number line from one uh from five to twenty two and that was how many swings and then it went down to two hundred centimeters

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_006.wav,um well without the rubber band it wouldn't go anywhere same with the propeller and the um uh the body of the plane was the straws so it kinda had to fit together um but so yeah that's how that worked um we were testing like um it was hooked to a string and we had to see how far it would travel with as many twists as the propeller would twist with the rubber band
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_004.wav,yeah okay so um we've been working on airplanes and we've been we did we're doing aviators and stuff so um we made our own little planes they're um a plane made out of straws a propeller and a rubber band um so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_010.wav,so it was the twist of the propeller hooked to the rubber band which made the propeller spin so it was that many twists and a twist would be all the way around all the way around so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_048.wav,it might need a little more winds to go across just because the turbulence is taking the strength out of it kinda it the rubber band and the propeller makes a really strong um group so when it travels it's a lot harder to uh it's a h n really hard uh so like it's really strong it's gonna be strong going across but if you hit turbulence onto it it's gonna be kinda slower and it's going to bump up and down which might weight the propellers it might like um it might make the propellers lose a little bit more um spins when it goes up it might not move as far or when it goes down it's not gonna move so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_018.wav,well we tested from fifteen and fifteen didn't make it very far maybe um maybe forty or fifty centimeters long it would go and we measured um our string after we um well we measured how long it would take until we hit the the airplane and the airplane if it was all the way across we knew that it flew the whole four hundred meter uh four hundred centimeters and then you knew with the the others um with the thirty centimeters i mean the the halfway line you'd have to go um to about two hundred centimeters so you'd go to two hundred centimeters see if that was halfway if not you try again and you try and well we predict and we see if we can get it the right length
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_050.wav,um passengers i think what will slow down uh i think it'll slow down just because um it'll be heavier so if you start with like two passengers i don't really think it's gonna make a huge difference but if you put like four or five passengers on it like paper clips for passengers or pennies for passengers it's gonna make a big difference because there's gonna be so much that it's gonna start to lower the string which is gonna make the plane fly lower and it might have a little more ch a lot more trouble flying so

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_038.wav,like how many rubber bands you'd put on the plane to see how much farther the force or passengers or turbulence or so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_062.wav,see so you have a chair we were just hooking them together with chairs so we put a chair on one end and we put it up on a wall and then we put the plane up there and we see if that will affect it or maybe it'll slide down more or anything so yeah

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_044.wav,well we haven't looked at it in exactly yet but um we were thinking of what would we already testing turbulence my group because we were thinking it might it might change it and it it so turbulence is like if you were on a plane you'd start hitting like bumps you'd be jumping up and down kinda um that's the kind of turbulence so if you hit the string with a pencil constantly constantly it will vibrate the string and the plane will take a lot longer to get over
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_052.wav,well we all gotta choose something to test uh i chose passengers and turbulence with my group just because um i think that will make a difference like rubber bands and propellers i don't think that's gonna make a very big difference but i i wanna see if passengers and turbulence will make a huge difference yeah we're gonna test that today and see what happens

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_024.wav,yes we were predicting how long well not really how long but um how far it would go with the twists yeah so it said how um our paper said how long do you th how big uh how long does it have to be to go to the lo um to the end or how many twists does it need to go to the end um and we all guessed around forty to twenty everybody thought that twenty to forty
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_014.wav,well um if everybody different different we'd all get different results cause some people would count halfway halfway halfway and it wouldn't be as much so it'd probably be around twenty or so so we tried to do the average twists and everything and so the average twist was thirty going halfway across so and then for halfway across would be twenty to twenty three spins to get it halfway across so
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1/myst_993200_2008-15-10_00-00-00_VB_3.1_058.wav,the parts of the system

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_062.wav,yeah it did because i would think that the larger string would actually go faster just because it's heavier and it's um but it turned out the littler strings were going faster um just i it it just because they were they didn't have to go as far they were like down down and i think that's why it was
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_014.wav,um i like math a little bit it's not my strongest subject um i'd have to say writing is my strongest subject so um but science is one of my favorite subjects just cause we get to do a whole bunch of experiments
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_024.wav,um well just recently we finished our one um it was our one uh e we were doing ecosystems we just recently finished that unit and um now we're learning about um like well we've done a pendulum or a swinger and yeah um and a swinger so we're basically just uh studying how it works and like the if you're leveled with your desk if when you drop it it will move or how many swings you'll go in fifteen seconds so that's basically what we've been doing
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_066.wav,yeah yeah that was a standard thing
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_054.wav,yeah
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_060.wav,a swing so um say you were starting from the right side of your desk so it goes down to the left and back to the right that's one swing so yeah that's one swing and that's how it's gonna work and then yeah
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_056.wav,desk level yeah
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_072.wav,um mmm maybe because when you swing you need the speed too and the only way to keep it going is to go up and then down again and you'll just keep going like that that's how a pendulum keep pendulum keeps going it keeps on moving higher lower higher lower it's kinda how that works
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_078.wav,um yeah we all did the same thing and i think the results came that it doesn't really matter so um the only thing that affected it was the string size
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_028.wav,well it's an easier word for pendulum but we just call it a swinger just cause it's easier so yeah that's what we call a swinger
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_001.wav,centimeters

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_044.wav,yeah

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_002.wav,hi

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_042.wav,um no we couldn't we did weight distribution too and we put two more pennies onto it well we started with one more penny so it there was two pennies on it and well it didn't really like there was more of a um it didn't really matter we started it at desk level first and then we started higher and lower and it still made twelve swings exact eleven to thirteen swings and so it didn't change um it didn't affect it
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_034.wav,the penny is basically weight distribution distribution and um it's it's gonna give it more weight and it's gonna help it swing a little more so s and we did take off stance with it like our desks are leveled and we have to bring the up to desk level and drop it and see how many swings we do in fifty seconds
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_050.wav,yeah the string made a difference all the uh the middle sizes weren't exactly like they weren't like um the middle sizes they made still the the the twelve to fourteen swings back and forth but otherwise it was just normal
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_010.wav,okay

/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_082.wav,and well if you look at a grandfather clock they have the pendulums in them is that they have two and they cross each other the whole time and by the hour um they kind of stop and they switch directions if you watch really carefully um but so um a pendulum kinda it's e like if you're looking at small clock it's gonna just be like back and forth really fast but so yeah
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_064.wav,faster so we all started back where the starting point was but when i dropped it it kinda went it was like maybe not even seventeen inches away from uh the de uh from the bottom and i think because of the larger string it had to go all the way down all the way up which is gonna be a lot harder for it but um for the smaller ones it just had to go down up down up which was really easy for it
/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993200/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2/myst_993200_2008-01-10_00-00-00_VB_2.2_026.wav,okay
