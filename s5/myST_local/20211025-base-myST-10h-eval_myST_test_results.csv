0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGED ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IND WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY TWO
1,OKAY,OKAY
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DON GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEARE
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THEY WOURED JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY IT TO EVERY ONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEYWRE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH
4,YEAH,YEAH
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT NTO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE U LENGTH OF THE STRING SO
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,UM PROBUBBLY THEXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S SAW TIT THAT WOULD MAKE IT DIFFERENTCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YEAH A LITTLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO ITOD THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HOURISONTOL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEACHER AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE RO ON ONE TIME IT WAS UM S LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT E NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THERE LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESSTD SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAYCAS AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT' SORT OF COME VIENSED USS THAT THES SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM UM WR LIKE EXACTLY  THE WAY OUR DESK WHERE  OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESS ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY U EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO AND WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TO YESTERDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY
14,MATH,YEAH
15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,OKAY
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L YOU ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THENS IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED
19,OKAY,OKAY
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YEAH AT FIRSCED WE T WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM UHP STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UH IF LIKE THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE IS FORCE IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
21,YEAH,YEAH
22,OKAY,OKAY
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SYSTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP IN A PENNY AND YO WOULD TACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPERCLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I S I I DIDN'T TELLHER THIS BUT THE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAD THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE ST THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,OKAY YES WE D DIN IN PENDIN LEMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BE UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO  IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING THE EXPERIMENTAT UNTILL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,OKAY
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'T'T DONE THAT YET
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISES PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY EFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ALEVEN SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS T
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WEWUD LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THOF STICKWEDTS AND THEN FLUEW UP TO THE WET NUMBER IT WENT TO WA HOW HOIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS W LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP AND STEAD UP DOWN
34,UM WE,UM WE
35,WE WERE USING,WE WERE USING
36,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SHE RETESTED WITH A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF
37,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP,U YEAH F WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP
38,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WEV JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WE'RE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LONGCHER THING AND THEN THE UM LIKE YEAH IDS THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
39,YEAH,YEAH
40,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WELL WILL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UHS UM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIRES AND THEN FLIPPERS
42,YEAH,YEAH
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MIS MOROUR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE THING
44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOWA HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT ALL WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MIS MOTO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT WHY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT EFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT EFFECTS THE OUT COME AT OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY DO KNEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE  RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,AND IT LOOK LIKE THAT IT WENT UP
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,MM HM YEAH AND THEN AFT WELL THEN WE TESTED EIT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICKS THAT SAIS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,WELL THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFOR CAUSE WE MADE IT RECORDING SHEE AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LETS SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFT TIMES AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON TE CALCULATER AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOURE AND THAT WAS A RESULT AND YEAH
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WEL WE ALL CAME UP WITH THE VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS TIN AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHESE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH WHEN THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE X AXISS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXISS WELL THE Y AXISS IS RIGHT HERE THE X S S IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEAT AND WE WALKED AND LENT SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXISS THERE WAS UM WA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW MU FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAPH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STIEL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS IN HE Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WIT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HOYT IT WENT
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMIN BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAT OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL THAT
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,M HM AND THEN WELL SO SIN STIXS WAS ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED STICX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIXS IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MIS MOO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSED TO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVHES ANOTHER BOLY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THO STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TR THIS TRIED AND YOU PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY INTO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE
63,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO
64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,THAT WAS FURTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS OR THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELLE TOPOWER T FE IT THROUGH Y GUAS
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOK LIKE THAT
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOUD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAD MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REEAL PLANE SO I BET THE  THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDERIT'S GOINGNTO GET THE MORE S THE MORE SPINS UM WE NOW WE AREIN TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DIDN' WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BE CAUSE WE AD T SCIENCE AND THEN TE  AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIEDED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWC WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE JUST JUST GAS TO WHAT NUMBER UH
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED O H LIKE TO JUST PULL ED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPON IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIENT WENT AND SO WE PUT IT ANT ONE END OF THE CHARE AND ACTUALLY OUN THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE  THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WEW TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW HO THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO PE E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO  S
71,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL WEL KNOW  REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN N THAT WOULD BE COOL
72,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETE FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOUR METERS,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETER FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FORMY
73,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YEAH ACTU LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT ALL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE JUST SIDED IT WAS TWO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A LIKE MORE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST JUST SIDED A TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AN IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY  WA
74,YEAH,YEAH
75,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKADNES WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS ERE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RES KEEPING FORTY SPINS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING FORTY SPINS LIKE THIS'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
76,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
77,YEAH,YEAH
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOLD TO SEE THEM FL TUT I WANT THIS SWINGERS  CAUSE  WE HAVED THIS VARIABLESOOK AND IT'S SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UHM A WOMON DOING  UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TI SEE AND THIS OMON WAS DOING A FRENT HAND S PRING OFF THEWAS SHE WAS DOING A BALT AND I DO BAL LIKE I TAKE DAMESTICKS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IS REALLY FUN THOUGH
79,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE UH YEAH FOUR METERS
80,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU GO AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEAETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FING YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY JUT TESTED IT LIKE ONCE
81,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHARE WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR IT WAS ONE CHARE WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROP IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PART IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHT NES OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKED NESS SO I BE THE CHARES WERE CROOKED

83,OH YOU'RE WELCOME OKAY,UHM YEA  OKAY
84,HELLO,HLLO
85,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
86,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,OALHL THE ALL THE'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE'D TE FOUR THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS OS CEL
87,YEP,YEP

155,YEAH,YEAH
156,UM YEAH,UM YEAH
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED THE TRYE TO HAVE THE SM THE OR HOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRYE TO FIND OUT HOW W W HOW WE COULD GET AND OUT COME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUT COM AN GET FIN FIND I IN A A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DID FOR TO THE PENNIES AND LIKE FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPINGTO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPD THE PENNY AND IT DROPPD TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPD TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO
160,YEAH,YEAH
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YEAH IT BECAUSE IT DE YOU WANT TO HA FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLINATION FOR YOUR EXPERIENMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU WOULD DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTER WARDS YOU WANT TO KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO ANTH END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS AND EACH ONE THEN OARE ARE E OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A  UM ALL IN ALL  UM  UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTIM TWELVE PENNIES
162,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAS SES O FER THE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD THE M LESS NO M LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS SLO TED LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOATAND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES AND I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REZEN WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM
163,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
164,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE SATURATED SOLUTION SOMETHING LIKE THAT NO THE START OVER,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE CETDRAD V SOMETHING LIKE NO THE STORT O

1079,THERE WERE TEN YEAH,THERE WERE TEN YEAH
1080,EVERY TEN WE COLORED IT A DIFFERENT COLOR,EVERY TEN WE COLORED IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
1081,WHAT WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANSWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE Y WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU G IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,WHET WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW IT ANDSWER WHEN YOUR LIKE YOU WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING THAT GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU COU IF YOU DIDN'T DO WIT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT
1082,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING,WHAT'S SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THET I WAS DEING EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE T LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING
1083,BUT USUALLY THEY HAVE LIKE MEASURING TAPES THERE,BUT YOU SUALLA EAS THAT YOU HAVE LIKE MEASURING TAPES OR
1084,WHAT KINDA THINGS DID I ESTIMATE,WHAT KIND OF THINKSI ASKDA ME
1085,OH YEAH IT WAS THE STRAW ONE,OH YEAH IT WAS THE STRAW ONE
1086,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,WONE MADE ME REALLIZES ARE WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THEN THE OTHER CLASS MADE AND THEN THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRES AND THEY'RE WEN DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM
1087,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE STARTING MEASUREMENT AN AMOUNTHS TO M
1088,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THAT ESTIMATING WITH ESTIMATING IS IND A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS
1089,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,ITWAS SURPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASSS

1164,IS TEN,JUST TEN
1165,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFICT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
1166,TEN OR MAYBE MORE YEAH,KIND OF MAYBE WORKE
1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,MEASUREMINT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASE A MORE BATTERIES LIKE LIKE THEY LIKE WHEN IT WRAPPED AROUND HUN YO VENTS IT PICKED UP THEI DO WASHES BCAUSE IT AD TWO BATTERIE
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,IF MINI ILL CREASE MORE THE LINES IT HAS MORE THAT R'S UP FORE
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,UH REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCE
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TICKET IT DOESN'T
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINUSED THE LINE TO SEVEN IT MEE TO TWEN ONES UM I WOULD'T TNOO SAY IT BEFOREI ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW IT JUST PICKED UP FINVE
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT I DISDSCOVERES WHEN I PUT MOREORE WRAPING MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM A MOR AH WASHERS STICK TO IT
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,UM THE'S ATTACHED TO THIRTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN IT PUT A HUNDRED WIS IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUP BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UPA I PICKED U TON WASHERS AND STEAD OF FUFTEEN WASHERS TO ADDE UP  FIVE MORE
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND  A RIVET
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,UM IN INCREASE ONE OURG   PICKS UP TO THE LOWER CAUSE YOU ANY I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT THE IT UNNA BUT ITS TO A HUNDRED WINS IT HAD LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WAS
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,WHAT IT RELATES IS
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,UH WHAT'S IMPARTANT IS THERE'IS AHO SUPPOSE TO B ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL H IT HAS TO BE THEIS CLOSED OR TO EVERYTHING
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE  VERSE ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES GOES UP TO
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,YOU' ACCOMPLESHE AT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE VET
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU'R WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRO MAGNTT IIT AR IDD MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THERE MOARE UM LINDS YOU HAVE WHAT 'S HAING  TE STRENGTH ITS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT A STAND THE BUTTER  GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WAHPENED TO MAM ME OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BATTERY
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,UM IT HAS TO FLOA THROUGH A BASING BOTER AND IN CAYSING LIGHT
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING THROUGH AND A LIGHT BULB  HE BABLEMAHANTING TOTH
1189,NO,BYE PEAZE THAT
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT IS ELECTRICITY IS EN'T SWOWNG THROUGHT BECAUSE IT NED S BE TURNS AROUND ANDS HAS TO HAVE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSTIVE E POSITIVE I SIE TOUCHING ACH OTHER AND WHAI TUR MOKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
1191,UM IT WILL <unk> IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,UM IT'LL IT'LL THE LIGHT BULB JU SHOULD BE BRIGHT AND BRIGHT ERTH TO LIGHT TOK THE LIGHT AND WILL BURN IT OUT
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS <unk> RIGHT,IT'SON BECAUSE M MA YE JUST HAVE ONE THE ELECTRICITY WILL RUN OUT AND THERE'S CERTAIN KINDS OF DIFFERENT BU THAT AN INSIDE IT SHINESLIGHT
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,IT'S GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES US  CIRCUIT IS WHE WHEN THE WISE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE HAND POSITIVE TO THE KASING WHERE AND THE BASING WATER
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,BOTH BYES THE EACH ISM THE REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEY'L BE EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,W WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU A JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TWO LIGHT BULBS IT'LL FTAL BE DOELL AND I WON'T SHINE BRIGHT BUT IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT'LL ONLY TWO LIGHT BULBS SHINE BRIGHTER
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THET ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE THE LIGHT BULB
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONCE A PATHWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,BUT I HAVE BEEN DOING SCIENCES LEIRTING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT IT WILL SHIGHT LOWER AND LOWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT A BATTERY WITHE BATTERYOU UT THE
1203,OKAY,GREAT
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT <unk>,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT WIH THE LIGHT WILL
1205,FINISH,PANISION
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,ALLTIUYT PEPLE THE C
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,WE PAA PAS AS OR THEA WE PETAT ITY A JUST  ATTACHP TO MUCH
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPENED IS A WIRE'S NEEDTO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IH WHAT BOTH OF WIRS HAS TO BE ON A BASING WIE AND UN A CASING WIRE
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULEBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ALSO THE LIGHTIS G BECAUSE OF FOR THE CR
1211,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO
1212,IT IT TURNS INTO THE,ITT TURNS INTO THE BLUE
1213,COLORS,COLORS I SEE
1214,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SHAS RED R ITS POST TO BE RED
1215,UM CHANGING COLOR,UM UM IT'S CHANGING COLOR
1216,UM IT WILL TURN DARK,UM IT WILL TURN DARK
1217,CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS,YU GET HRANGE THE SAME CS THE FULD TURN
1218,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,UM IT'S NO USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN LIME AND IT'S JUST BIG GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
1219,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,ITS AN THE PRISM IS CHANGING IT COLORS
1220,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,IT WOULD LOWH HOW TO REFLECTION THE BIG O AR YAH
1221,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FR TO A PERSON
1222,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S DING BECAUSE IT'SPRET REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
1223,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIGHT EP PUMP ASHING OFF OF OBJECTS THROUGH BOTH TE COLOR BLUE
1224,SEVEN SIX,SEVEN COX
1225,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,BUT HOW IT REFLECKS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKEH TO VIALLATE TO PURPALE TO POLLUETE TO GREAIN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE T RED
1226,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTE I DON'T PROUB BAL
1227,THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR,THE REFLECT WAS IT USED TOITTO MIXING THE COLOR
1228,TURNS INTO,TRANSIT YELLOW LOW ING

1232,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF UM  LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BA BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY USE THE LIGHT
1233,BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME COLOR,BECAUSE ITS HAVE THE SAME COLOR
1234,TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,TURNING IT TO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
1235,YES THE REFLECTION THE COLOR,YES THE REFLECTION OF THE COLOR
1236,UM THE LIGHT LITTLE REFLECTS OFF THE LIGHT,IT WAS ON ON KNE E YAY AT UHM AND SOMETHING LELE O THEY WIMS LECKT OP TO BE
1237,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF
1238,SIX COLOR,SIX COLE
1239,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COLOR IS REFLECT OFF IN IT CHANGES ITS COLOR
1240,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SOLAR DELLS TEND U THE CIRCUITS A I'M TH THEY DIS
1241,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,WHAT HAPPENS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH DIT DOES THAT BEB WHEN THE CART IT'S WHITE IT DOES IT TURNS BLUE
1242,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT,THEYR HAVE LIGHT
1243,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,N NO UM O ONES BCHEREA TAXKNINES UH AND NIE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS
1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,IN BY ITS SPFORCED
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FORCE WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,WHAT IT DOESN'T UH MIX THE FIRST A WEAKER
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS T OUTH PAPER THATT'S A THE PAPER CLIP ISM TOP AND IT MOVES IT ALRIGHT
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS MEASURENE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S MO TIC CONNECT
1249,THE MAGNET <unk> THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNET IT THE MAGNET IS M  IS ENDES LIKE STCK AND AND YOU'RE JUST MADE IN THE MAGNET AND THE PAP CLICK AUSE NOW MAGNETS ISM CONNECTED TOT
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN IT JUST ENTERED WHEN WASHER IT BROKE ITS ALL BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE UHAN THE SPACES MADE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSORBE HAPPENING IS LIKE A TIM PRESSING THE WASHERS GO IN
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT IS  BANEU BAALLY ADD ONES SPACERT BREAKS A STALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM IS N'T REALLY S YU TO STICK ON
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE UH MAT THAT MAKES T THE UM AMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS AND ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAG MAGNETS AND ETHTHER CUPS TIF SEE A UM HOW MANY UM WASHERST BREAK OF THE MAGNETS FALL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE BOTOO UT THE MAGNETISM OF THE ATUALLY IS FORCED TOENOUGH
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEYT GET FIRTHER APART A THE FIRST GO FORCE CO IS AE WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNETS MAGNETTIS FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES T WEAKER
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,THEY'RES SPREADDING APART
1260,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,CAUSE I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP UH TO HOW MA WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKENS FALL
1261,MAGNETISM,MAGNETCTISM
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WHIT'S GOING ON HERE IF I WHEN IT PRESSPEACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THEL MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNETS ARE STILL TOUCHING ACH OTHER
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,IT GAESE BIGGER THAN THE IT GOES SMALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOEST UM MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER WEAK A WORKER IN STAD OF BEING STRONGER AND USUALLY THE FORCING
1265,I NEEDED THREE,I NEEDED THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,I NOTICE IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE'S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MAGNET CO HOLD TE PAPER
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S EVERY BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE BOING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TICK OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METTAL ENT UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF UM UH THE KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I'SHALL THIS VEEO ONSE WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL RON THE MAGNET AND STICK INTO A PAPER CLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF IT
1269,<unk> THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,THAT NO IS ACTING LIKE A
1270,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL ITH THE THIN ONE IS LIKE SSOF ONE I GUESS THEREAND ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EESY BECAUSE IT'S THICKING HE THEH'S AAT OF A LOT AND THEN I STARTD ON THIS AND THEN IT'S GOING LIKE THAT AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE MAGT
1271,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH TO THICK PIECE OF PEOPELRE IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK A ANDT THI IT COULD BECAUS IT'S SO ES
1272,BUT THE DIFFERENT <unk> PUSH BACK,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AND WY THEY PUSHED BACK
1273,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATEST MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET AND  MIXT UR THROUGH HAND IT JUST REALLY REANET IT DON'T WITH THOESE PA IT
1274,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,WE IT EIS UP THAT THAT WITH THAT IS FINE THINGS JUST
1275,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACTN UM HOW IT GET THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET CAUS IS SO UM IT SO WELL STRONG THAT IT COULD GO THROUGH ANNEA ANDNOTERD IT HOLD TA PAPER CLIP
1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,THE MOTOR CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNETS ON IT ITT REACTS LIKE
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISN'T IT ACTING LIKE A MAG UM MM LIKE WI YOU COULD RAPP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY AND CURENT FLOWING THROUGH AN STILL MAKE IT'S STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AN REACTS LIKE A METAL
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,WHEN IT'S TO MAKE IT ON IT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN IT'SN IT CAN NOT STICK TO THE PAPER CL
1279,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,HE WOTER IS FOON ARON IS  THE MOADI IS HOLDER TO PAK TE CLIP AN THAT AIR
1280,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LEARNNG ABOUT MAGNETISM
1281,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT'S BECAUSE THER MAGNETISM CAN NOT GO THROUGH BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH MAKE ATAGRAP OF UM PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S F
1282,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST SEE THE SAME THING YOU'RASURING YO LAST NIGHT
1283,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,UM M ARE YOUSEPETAING ME A MOVE BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THAN I ON THE PAPERCLIPS
1284,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WATAR OP BUNNIE IS IT' STICK ING TO AN AIR AND IT'S CONNECTED PAPER
1285,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEAY THE SAME PICTURE
1286,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,ONCEE THE MAGNETS OPH ANOTHER TABLE AND THEN THE MAGNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETS CONNECTING IT AND WHOLE
1287,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,MOTOR IS HAPPENINGS THE FORCE ANT CANS STIRT GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNET FORCE IS SO LIKE ITS O STRONG
1288,REPEAT THAT,REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE
1289,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS RE MOVED FROM THE NAIL AND TS THE NAIL UZES ITS MAGNETTISM
1290,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP<unk>,WTHAT'S GOING ON HEREIS A METALI AN A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
1291,LEARNNG ABOUT MAGNETISM,NOT GREAT
1292,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CIP CAN NOT REPEL EACH OTHER
1293,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,I SEE IS A MAGNET AND THI NA AND IT'S FORCED KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
1294,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD <unk> PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD PAPERCLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
1295,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT IS SHAWING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM
1296,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETTISM PRESES OFF AND BECAUSE ITS A MAGNET IS MAKING IT JUST
1297,THE <unk> FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER AND ODOR MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
1298,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET,IT CAN'T BE CAUSE UM THE TE MAGNET TAEM FORCE
1299,THE LIGHT BULBS ALL OF THEIR ELECTRICITY AND,LIGHT BULBS ARE ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND
1300,OKAY,OKAY
1301,A D CELL BATTERIES AND,A D CELL BATTERIY IS OF TE
1302,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS LIGHT IT UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY TO U
1303,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOTS OF TE ELECTRICITY GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND ROUND LIKE THE LIGHT BULB
1304,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,THE DIFFERENT BOATS CONNECT TO THE WIZE OR THE FASE L  WI REALLY WIH BECAUSE THE CLASTIC IS HOLDING
1305,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE THEY D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHTB
1306,BUT I NOTICE IS SOME IMPORTANT THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT,WHAT INOTICE IS CERTAIN PARTS THEYT ARE LIES CONNECTE
1307,THE ELECTRICITY FLOW,THE ELECTRICITY
1308,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,THE DIRECTION THE FLOW WHEN IT Y HE SWITCHS THE D CELL IS IT CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND E POSITIVE SIDE IT'S GOING OTHER DIRECTION
1309,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING ADD OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY 'S FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1310,WITH THE AT THE SAME WIRE AND YOU,I THINK THAN IS BECAUSE A BUTTAL WORK BECAUSE IT'S BOTH AT THE SAME WHI AND YOU ON'T POL
1311,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHENT WHATEVER SID YOU JUST SWITCH IT TO ITS STILL WORKS THE SAME ONE
1312,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOES IN'T A CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
1313,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WHA ONE WIRE IS HITTING THROUGH THE PIECE OF WIRE ONE IS HETTING TO THE BASE WIRE
1314,WIRES IN IT CIRCUIT CARRY,WIRES AND AS CIRCUIT CARRY
1315,OKAY BUT,OKAY BYE
1316,THE COMPONENT NEED TO BE RIGHT,THE COMPONIEN NEEDS TO BE HA AR
1317,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY IF BATTERY GIVING IT IT'S,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BYE THE BATTERY GIVING IT'S IT'S ENERGY TO PUSHERE BY
1318,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,WHAT I NOTICED THAT YI DIDNT GET THE LIGHT BULB A LIF TO INSTORDER TO LIGHT UP THE LIGHT IF ENERGY
1319,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,SO WHAT I NOTICED IT HAVE LY SHUT UP CAS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH AND PUL WIRES IN TO THE LIGHT
1320,WHERE IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE D CELL <unk> WIRES,WHERE THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE D CELL IS POR OF  THE WIRES
1321,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW THAT IS GOT,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND NOW BATTERES GOING
1322,ELECTRICITY,THE BLUE DOTS WONS AN ELEC TRISCT
1323,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,'S WHAT THAT MEANS TO MEAT UIS A CIRCUIT GOING AROUND AND AROUND LIKE T WITH THE ELECTRICITY
1324,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE M
1325,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,I' THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITY'S FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1326,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
1327,WHEN YOU PUT THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING TO,WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL IN INSTEAD OF GOING PA
1328,ON THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH,OF ENERGY IS GOING THROU
1329,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATTERY HELPS WITH THE WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP LIGHT IT ON AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
1330,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S IMPARTANT SO THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK COULD GO THROUGH THE FROGK BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GETIP TO GET THE MAGNET
1331,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THE CIRCUIT IT'S BEENPORTANT ABOUTS CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
1332,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,THE WIRE THE RIVET THOGH THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FROM BECAUSE THAT'S FOR THE UM ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY COOK UP THE
1333,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,IT ACTS TO  MAGNET AT CONNECT THAT IT ID ON PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRISE
1334,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,UM THE ELECTRICITYS STARS GOES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE HA CONNECTIV IS WIH ALL THE WASHES CONNECT AND THE MGES THROUGH THEUM POSITIVE SIDE THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1335,WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT,WE LEARNED ABOUT UH AH HOH E CIRCUIT AND OUR UM CLASE WI GET AFFECTED AND UH I DNON'T WEIGH
1336,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BECAUSE IT IRON OR STEEL THO THE MAGED TO SOBMIT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT ENENT TO GET THE MAGNETIC WORNS
1337,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UND TOL THE UM WAR IS UM CLOSED
1338,SMALL,OAL
1339,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WELL THE CIRCUIT U HE SWITCH AT LEAST U SOMETHING T HAS TO BE PLUCGED AUT OF A MA NEC AT FOUR CELLS TA ELECTRICITY CES GO THOUGH SOMTHANG THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE
1340,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,AOR HAPPENG THAT THE RIVER AND THE WIRES IS UM YOU HAS TO AT LEAST CONNECT SOMOR AT LEAST DO SOMETHINGOT
1341,A RIVET,A RIVET
1342,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM A WASHERS NOT STICK TO THE THEHWHE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS
1343,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OF ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH IT UP TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE
1344,SCIENCE,SCIENCE
1345,WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS IN,WHAT THAT RELATES TO SWITCHES IT AND
1346,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,PENS IF WHEN IT HAS A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCES ABL JUST UH AR CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS SA AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT UL
1347,THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,THAT IS ALL APBOUT IS  A MAGNEGATIVE FORCE
1348,IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE,OH IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
1349,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT,UH CLEOU REPEAT THAT I
1350,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,MAGNETIS WHEN IT'S IN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCEIS THE UM IT CONNECTTO IT THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT IT HAS NO MOR TO COMPELE IT TO THE WIRE

1463,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS T  THEN IT ELECTRICITYS STOP GOES STOP GOE BUT IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT FLOES AGROUND AND THEXTIAND LAD AND TACIS
1464,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOR AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT WELL THERE IS ONLY SUPOSED TO BE ONE
1465,WHAT'S GOING ON IT GONE OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH <unk> BUT STILL USING THE SAME THING BUT NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND BY THE,WHAT'S GOING ON IT IT'S GOING OUT THE BATTERY IND THROUGH BUT'S STILL USING THE SELLAR THING BUT THEY NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND ORDER TO LIGHT UP
1466,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE
1467,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,WHAT I NOTICED TAT THAT THE PATH WAY IS THE ENERGY IS TO COM  THEY 'RE DIFFERENT CAN AT SHUN
1468,<unk> WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WELL THES BEST ONE NOW E GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AND ENL LIKET BULB BECAUSE THERE'S NOT WASTED ED ENERGY
1469,<unk> THE <unk> THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE <unk> BECAUSE THE <unk> CONNECTED RIGHT,M THE FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP BECAUSE THE WAY IT ITS GOING BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTED RIGHT
1470,WHAT I OBSERVE THE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS <unk> THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY <unk>AND GOING TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS <unk>,WHAT I OBSERVED HAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY GOING TO BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
1471,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,WAT I NOTICED THERE'S ENERGY LIKES GOING AND D BATTERY IT'S GOING INTO THE BATTERY
1472,<unk> THE THE BATTERY REALLY ELECTRICITY,THE END IF THE BATTERY RAR ELECTRICITY
1473,WHAT I THINK WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPENED IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM S IT AL LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1474,I THINK THIS IS THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT

1895,UM LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN,UM LIKE WHAT DID YOU KEEN
1896,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHAIRS AND DUCT TAPED EM AND OUR WE WINED UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WAIT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASS ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHARES AND DECTAPED DOMAN OR WE WIND UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND THE RABBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WHAT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IT S THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASSE UN HOAWL FAST THE PLANE GOES
1897,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTILL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN RIGHT IT DOWN
1898,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO AT THE TOP OF THE POD AND THEN ARE GONNA GO DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF GOING DOWN LIKE UM MAYBE LIKE IN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING IS AT,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UME LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GOIN GO AT THE TOP OF THE POND AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA GO DOWN TE STEPS AND THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRES WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND U JUST BY IN MY APPINYON I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO THROUH FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK I' HEVE A U VERY WELL TRANS F COME DOWN LIKE UM MAY BE LIKE AN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'L PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIRE CAUSE OF THE AND GOE DI STRING IS THAT
1899,N MMM AS LONG IT'S AS LONG A IT'S THE STRING IS TIGHT AND THE PLANE IS ON MMM HMM,M M AS LONG IT'S AS LONG AS IT' THE STRING IS TIG AND THE PLAYT IS URD MM H
1900,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE A TWENTY MAYBE LIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP,WE'REXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE AND TWENTY MAYBE A LIKE AND TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP
1901,BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP,AT IT I ASKIN ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP
1902,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,WELL UH THE JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US THE
1903,YEAH,YEAH
1904,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALF WAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DUEST THE HOW MANY SPINS TES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY
1905,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALF WAY AND ALL THE WAY AND DUM SOMETIMES WHEN WENT WHEN WE STREATCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SPATSHING INTO THE NOTHER CHARE THE ROPE GOES DOWN AND LIKE COT THE
1906,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT THIT WOULD PROBABLY HAVED TO DUBBLE IT IF IT WAS LUESER WE L LIKE UM TO WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR O'R PLANEALL THE WAY UNM FIFTY TWO WINDS AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LECER WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO SPIN WORE
1907,SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE,SORRY UM I GUESSED TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE
1908,YEAH,YEAH
1909,WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY THOUGH,WE'R GONNA DO THAT TODAY
1910,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MY SELF THEN UM I MAY HAVE JIS COUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE
1911,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,U WELL UM WE WERE CHUSING ONE VARIABLE FOREEACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM IS MODO BROUGHT IN LIKE MANY PANDS AND WE'RE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT I IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER
1912,A SANDWICH,A SANDWICH
1913,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MAKEGER WAR RIGHT AND FRENT AND WE THEY DID UM THREE MAT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING MGES
1914,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE D AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND NIN DID FIVE INCH AND IT UF THE CUP  UH HUHM AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOU'RE HEIGT JUST LONGER I GUESS U HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN THEN THE ONE IT WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TWO SIX SIT'S FULL YEAH YEAH
1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL TH OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURE  JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO TO IT IN ALL DIFFRENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNEOR CORNER CORNER CORDI AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING I IN THEMIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE L THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE F FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TIE TO IN YOU KNOW ON THE TI TINNACH THE THERE LIFE BOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UHM MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CROUSBOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REAL Y BIG CROUEW SHIP
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL LUNDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIE'S JUST TALL O VOSLATE WE WE TRIED TO PUT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN T GO TO THE SIDE
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,FEL LIKE A SUPERSTARU LIKE ALREADY KNEW THAT KNOIN WIDN
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCSED TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASSH PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
1922,YEAH,YEAH
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,UM WELL OUR THIMEINIES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIT'S NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTITINING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOWT BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHATH THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW LIT WILL FLOAT OR HOW T IT WILL SINK
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT AND OUR BIN IT'S LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY ETHE HIN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED THEN THREE
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MEAD THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW WIE PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MED THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE TOOK THE COPPY CUP OR A CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIG AND WE TOOK A PENS SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH THE DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUTT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UHM THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT UM ONE SIDE IT WAS GON THE SINK EVEN FASTER SO
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAWT
1927,THE HEIGHT,THE HEIGHT
1928,MAYBE,MAYBE
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFT CAL BOAT CAN HOLD
1930,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE
1931,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS
1932,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CROUE BILT MAY BE LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOMEREASON IF THERE'S A TARRABL IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THEREWOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE  COULD JELLY IN TIMES BIGGER SO
1933,YEAH,YEAH
1934,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE UM WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WAY TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARTER GUNE SORRAIGH UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARTER GUNE IT WE HAD TO STUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO I WAS LIKE DOWN HERE ANDOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE'S DOWN HERE DOWN HERE AND SO WE STUCKED IT ALLF AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TO
1935,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREE CENTIMETERS,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN HUR CUP THREE CENTIMETERS
1936,FIFTY S A HUNDRED AND THREE AND FIFTY SIX,FIFTY S  A HUN R THE UH AND FIFTY SECNS

1939,ONE MORE TIME,NOR MORE TIPE
1940,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THEN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED SANK TO THE SIDE AND
1941,IS THIS THING ON RIGHT,IT YUS BEN ONRIGHT
1942,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCEES THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIE'S WHERE YOU WANT TO PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT IS BIG STARTED
1943,FIVE INCHES,FIVE INCHES

2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BULLE AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAILE MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE IN
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MOD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POURE IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS BEN VERY IMPORTANT ROL BECAUSE WHELL THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,IT BEGANS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIX TOGETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOULE THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,IT IS CALLED WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,OKAY UH GOOD
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNICH PILE AND THIS IS IMPRT IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEY ARE UNICE PILE INSTEAD OF BEN ONE ALL TOGETHER IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S A SOLUTION
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT ITS PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING SEE IF THE  AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UN WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEH

2497,UH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK,THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOOTS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE DIFFERENT COLOR SQHARLE INSIDE AND UHM I'M TALKI
2498,THEY'RE SEPARATING,THEY ARE SEPARATING
2499,THE SALT WILL WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,THE SALT WOULD WAL DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2500,GOOD BYE,GOOD BYE
2501,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THATIT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT  WASEVER THERE IN THE WATER
2502,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS ONE ONE OR MORES WHEN MUTIPALE THINGS ARE MIXT TOGETHER AND VEARABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULSPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
2503,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,SO THE SALAD HAS MANY THINGS MIX INTO IT ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEAMNS AND NORMAL BEAMNS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES
2504,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF ND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN LIKE THE MOD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN TE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN

2911,SO YEAH SO CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,S SURUM CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
2912,I DON'T,I DON'T KNO
2913,WELL THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIKE BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING EACH OF LIKE BULB TWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK TO LIKE BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK ITS TO THE A POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOESN'T AGAIN,WELL THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING ITO H LIGHT BULB TWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK THROUGH LIGHT BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK INTO THE  POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOES THAT AGAIN
2914,SO MORNIE,S UP MARNI
2915,I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT,I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT
2916,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDES TOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE WIRES GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKE INTO,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING E NEGATVE SIDE SIDE AND A WIRE IS GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE UN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKING THE
2917,AH UMM,UM
2918,IT WOULD BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY WILL,THEY WERED BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUITIT AND ELECTRICITY WON'T
2919,ELECTRICITY BECAUSE ELECTRICITY IS A BLUE DOTS FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE WHILE THROUGH THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHEN THE WIRE ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S THE UNTIL LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHERS,ELECTRICITY CAUSE ELECTRICITYS AR BLUE DOTHS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE ONE OF THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHENE  THE WIRES ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND AND TURNIN TO LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHER
2920,JUST IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS ACTUALLY STAYING LIKE ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS A NOT REALLY AND KEEPS GOING OFF AND YOU HAVE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE BULB AND STUFF LIKE,IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE'S ACTUALLY STAYING LIT O D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS LIKE NOT REALLY IT IT KEEPS GOING OFF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LIKE REALL DO LIGHT BULB AND STUFF LIKE
2921,AH WELL RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAD THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE,UM WHEN RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAS THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHINGEACH OTHER WELL WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE
2922,ONE D CELL AND IT'S NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL,I ON ONE D CELL IT SONT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO UM BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL
2923,IT WON'T GLOW,IT WON'T GLOW
2924,THE CIRCUITS ABOUT A FALSE CIRCUIT,A CIRCUITS ABOUT A FULL CIRCUT
2925,ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVES THOSE CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY WHICH IS CIRCUIT WIRE,ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVESN THE CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY MAKES A CIRCUIT WORK
2926,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2927,USING MAGNETS SO YOU HAVE MAGNETISM,USING MAGNETS TO SEE WEL HAS MAG NATISM
2928,THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRICITY,THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRICE
2929,WHAT PICTURE,WHAT PICTURE
2930,WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAVE THAT WHAT,WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE THE AN
2931,IF WIRES BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE WHICH SHOULD MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,IT FLOWS BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRES ARE OND THE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES ON NEGATIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING IT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
2932,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2933,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNO
2934,FOR AN ELECTRICITY BE GOING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT,ORM ELECTRICITY BE GOING THROUGH THE CIRCTIT
2935,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
2936,HI MORNIE,BYE MARNIE
2937,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THERE IS NOTHING THERE IS NO WIRE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE IS ONLY WIRE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY AND THE THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO WIRES TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S ONLY WIRES TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE
2938,THERE ARE LIKE BULBS ARE GLOW,THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOW
2939,THEY LONG GLOW POSSIBLY,THEY WON'T GLOW POSSIBLY
2940,IT REFLECTED BY IT WILL GET MAY BE IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND MORE D CELL TO YOU GET FIT IN THIS,IT EFFECT IT BYE IT WILL GET MAYBE IT W'LL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER THE MORE D CELLS YOU GET FIT IN E

3844,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF THERE IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME JUST SEE IF IT'LL AFFECT IT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,UM THE VARIABLES ORE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THE UM AND A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A M SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF IT'S A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT IF YOUXSPK CAUSE YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME TO SEE IFITLL AFFECTED THAT'S NOT A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT
3845,UH LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH,LOOKS LIKE THERE TRYING TO FORGOT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTY NER ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH
3846,WELL WE HAD WE EVEN HAD A TWO HUNDRED,WELL WE AD WE'VE N HAD A TWO HUNDRED
3847,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT WELL RECORDING INFORMATION LIKE LET'S SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING A FORTY CENTIMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN ON THE GRAPH WE WE DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE LIKE A TOWER ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT RIGHT WELL RECORDING YOUR INFEORMATION LIKE LET'S SAY WE ADD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING OF FORTY CENTIMETER STRING INDTA FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING THEND ON THE GRAPH WED WE'D DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRINGAD THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVENND ALL THEWAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WED MAKE AK A TOWER ALL HE WAY UP TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFRMATION
3848,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PER PAPER AIRPLANES AND VARIABLES THAT ARE FO UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPERCLIP AND TAPE AND IT FLIES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE WELS THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PAR PAPER AIR PLANES AND VARIABLES AT A UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPER CLIP AND TAPE AND IF FLYES BETTER YOU DODN'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY U SHUDNALLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
3849,UM VARIABLE IS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD AFFECT IT,UM VARIABLE WIS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD AFFECT IT
3850,M WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID LIKE IT UM SWUNG MORE MORE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE,U WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID  LIKE AND UM SWOUNG MORE MORE THAN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING S Y ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE
3851,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT CONTROLLED,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT STRINGSND TERE EACH AF DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THATS WHAT MAKES IT CONTROLED
3852,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SIZED OF PAPERCLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPERCLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THIY WRE DIFFERENT SIZE PAPER CLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPER CLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S RETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
3853,NO WELL THE PAPERCLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPERCLIP SIZE,UM WELL THE PAPER CLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED A LENGTH WOFH THE STRINGS SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME AS THE PAPER CLIP SIZE
3854,OKAY WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS OF THE BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT,OKAY U WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS OF THE BOB EFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH THE STRING AFFECTS IT
3855,UM THE WAY WE SHOWED THE RESULT IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT LIKE WELL WE HELD IT AND WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER,U WAY WE SHOWED THERESULTS IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT BLANG WHELL WE HELED ITND TE WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER
3856,M,
3857,UM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME,UM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS I ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
3858,UM WELL THIS KIND OF CONNECTS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU CAN DO TO SHOWS ALL THE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT JUST LIKE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR LIKE THE SLOPE LIKE RIGHT HERE,SO THIS IS THIS KIND TIS IS IS  EXACT LIKE OUR PLANE EXCEPT WE HAVEN'T SHAE WE I THINK WE MIGHT CHANGE THE UM
3859,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE THO PEOPLE AREXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE
3860,UM YOU,UM YOU
3861,WELL WE FIGURED OUT IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT,WELL WE FEGRED I TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE POR SENT A OF THE WAY BUT THIS SHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE POR SENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS IS HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT
3862,UM THE RUBBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES GETS IT TO MOVE,UM THE RUBBER BAND IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KINDAF LIKE THE ENSION THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES SKGETS IT TO MOVE
3863,THE ANGLE OF THE STRING BUT YEAH,THANGLES STRINGH BUT YEAH
3864,FOUR METERS SORRY I MEAN IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS,FOR METERS SORRY I M IT LOOKS AT TCAUSE WHENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS
3865,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE IS ROBOTS TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH
3866,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,UM WELL WERE JUST ERNGD THE JUST GIN NA MAKE A COLD CONTRACTION LIKE WE HAVE TO PROPELLER WITH THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISED IT IT UP IT'S GOINNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YE HA THE PROPELLER POWER AND AND THEY WRE GNNTA TRY PUTTNG PASSENGERS AR ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH
3867,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERS  THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST  KIND TO SIT THERE
3868,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULDAFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BILD IT THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
3869,S SO,US SO
3870,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THE THE FIE FLIGHT LINE OKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP WORD AND YEAH LOOK WELL IT F T LOOKS LIKE IT'S CILLED ET UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH
3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS E RELLS SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOINGNAT GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE A PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OUR IS IS A RUBBER BAND WICH LIKE TWIST THE PROPELLER BUT UM YOU ALSO NEED SOMETHIN WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE BE LIKE CHARES SO THAT THE WIRE WILL LT'S LIKE STAY ON SO AT THE WIREQWIRE C WE CAN TI THEWIRE TO THE CHARES AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND A HAVE PAPER UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST ED AN THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
3873,HI,HI
3874,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO WOR HOW FASTIT REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS OTH VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S TH YOU CAN JUST IDE BUTS HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FARS OR THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOUT CAN CHANGE
3875,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM ITS ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERSENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNED IT LOOKS HERE THAT THIS GRAPH WOULDNT BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR IT US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERE SENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERED ONLY SAYS TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO T HIT'D BE IN CORRECT AND UM YEAH
3876,W WELL WE HAVE A S WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN IN HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THIS S PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND THE PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE,WELL WE HAVE US WE HAVE THREE STRAWS HON THEY GO ONE THAT GOES IN THE WIR AND THEN IM HER IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DODOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAYBLED ON EACH SIDED THN WE JUST HAVE THE SUP PRPELLER PIECE OR RUBBER BANDD A PIECE TAT GOES IN THE BAG THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE
3877,UM ONE THING THAT AFFECT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAN AFFECT IT IS THE TYPE OF STRING IN OUR CASE WE'RE DOING FISHING WIRE BUT T IT COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING OR UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS AND THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS,UM ONE THING THA WOULD EFFECT IT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THATC EFFECTED IS THE TYPE OF STRING AND WARKUTS WOULDN'T FISHING WIRE BUT YOU COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING THE ERE AH MANY THINGS THAT COULD EFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS IN THE TYPE OF STRING OR ONE TWO THE MAIN THINGS
3878,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ANGLED LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CL IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT,WELL IF THENGLE DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ITS INGLE LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNTO GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOUAND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANDGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN BECAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIME A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M C IF YOU'RE CLIMING IT A HILL YOU GET MORE EXAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HIL THAND GOING DOWN IT
3879,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS UP WE WANT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE WO A YARD AND A HALF,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOW IN OURS BUT WE WANTNA GET OUR UP WE WON'T BUT THE GOL AS TO MAKE OURS MOVE A YARD AN AT HALF
3880,UM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND,UM WE NEED A THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TA CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND
3881,WELL THE THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE ON THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER,WELL THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNO FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S APED UP SO IT HAS IT IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND TE ONE OF THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER
3882,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAKE AIRPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE BIGARPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE
3883,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU'LL YOU COULD CHANGE,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WES FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF ITS LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU YOU COULD CHANGE
3884,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE,IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE
3885,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FORTY FIVE,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WHEN FORTY FIVE
3886,BYE,MOR HERE
3887,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GO BUMPY AND THEN IT'LL LIKE AFFECT IT AND WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEED A WELL THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOOTH LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR UH STEEP UP OR ELSE IT'LL UM THEN IT'LL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GETTLE BUMING IN THA LITTLE LIKE EFFECT IT AND WELL YOUN YOU NEED A YIU LETSE NEES GET WELLOW THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE MOOTHE LINE IT CAN'T BE TWOO FA A STEEP UP RLS IT ALL UM A WELL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWIST YO GIVE IT AND YEAH
3888,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED A MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED A CHANGE THAT OBVIUSLY IN YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO IT'S JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFEFERENT IT IS
3889,WHAT,WHAT
3890,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,WELL YOU USE ER NO THE TOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
3891,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING
3892,YEAH YEAH THAT'S,YEAH YEAH THAT'S
3893,HI,HI
3894,THERE'S ONE HUNDRED,THER IS ONE HUNDRED
3895,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F N,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F IN
3896,YEAH,YEAH
3897,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS
3898,A RULER YEAH,E A RULER YEAH
3899,Y LIKE THIS,LIKE THIS
3900,YES YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY,YEHS YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY
3901,YEAH,YEAH
3902,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGOU ABOUT EVERYTHING
3903,BECAUSE I WAS OUR S THE STRAWS ON OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE'S SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT,BECAUSE OUR WAS ARE ST THE STRAWS THAT OUR TEE WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLES SO WE COU HAVD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT
3904,YEAH,YEAH
3905,WE LEARNED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM CAN,WE LEARNED THAT MHENMNETRIC SYSTEM CAN
3906,IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THE,IT'S ABOUT MEASSURING THE
3907,YEAH,YEAH
3908,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL
3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME CUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY ET'S DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGOUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO IT WE USE A METRITIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH THE'RE KUNTRIYE
3911,OH NO,I DON'T KNOW
3912,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF WE'RE ONE METRIC ONE METER HIGH NO,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF FOR ONE METRICK ONE MEETER HIG NO

3923,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME ANSWER,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME ANSERA
3924,IT WAS A PAPERY AND LONG,IT WAS UP PAPER AND LONG
3925,WE DIDN'T GET A THREE OR A FOUR OR,WE DIDN'T GET A THREE ORIFOUR OR
3926,THEY'RE LITTLE LINES,THEY'RE THO LITTLE LIONES
3927,BEC SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHERE THE DECAMETER WAS AND THE CENTIMETER,SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHAT THE DECIMETERL IS AND A CENTIMETER
3928,NO,NO
3929,OH THERE'S TEN IN ONE DECAMETER,OH THERE'S TEN IN THE ONE DECOINGEITHER
3930,THEN WE GOT M WE DIDN'T GET A WHOLE NUMBER,THEN WE GOT M WE DIDN'T GET A WHOLE NUMBER
3931,THEY WERE CUT UNEQUALLY,THEY WERE CUT UN EQUALLY
3932,THAT'S THAT'S TEN CENTIMETERS,THAT'S THAT'S TEN CENTIMETERS
3933,THAT MEANS IT'S,THAT MEANS IT'S
3934,YEAH,YEAH
3935,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS INTO ONES THAT WERE EQUAL,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS AND TWO ONES THAT WERE EQUAL
3936,YEAH,YEAH
3937,THAT THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN IT,THAT THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERSIN IT
3938,ONE FIFTH OF A,ONE FIFTH OF THE
3939,BECAUSE THERE'S AN EMPTY IN FRONT OF AN E T IN FRONT OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THEN AN M E T IN FRONT OF THE METER,BECAUSE THERE'S AN EMTY INFRONT OF EMMTY INFRONT OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THEN THEN EMTY INFORONT OF A METER

3943,UH YOU CAN MEASURE,UH YOU CAN MEASURE
3944,YEAH WE MEASURED IT WITH A UNEQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR OUR FOR HOW HOW BIG OUR DESKS ARE,YEAH WE MEASURED IT WITH AN UN EQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR AURE FOR HOW L HOW BIGG OUR DESKS ARE
3945,UM MEASUREMENTS UH THE METRIC SYSTEM,UM MEASUREMENTS UH THE METRIC SYSTEM
3946,YOU COULD TELL IF IT WAS FIVE OR,YOU COULD TELL IF IT WAS FIVE ORE
3947,YES,YES
3948,THAT MEANS THAT THE UNEQUAL LENGTH STRAWS WERE WEREN'T THE RIGHT SIZE BUT THE EQUAL STRAWS WERE THE RIGHT SIZE,THAT MEANS THAT THE UN EQUAL LENGTH STRAWS WERE WERN'T THE RIGHT SIZE BUT THE EQUAL STRAWS WERE THE RIGHT SIZE
