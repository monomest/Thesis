174,UM WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS IS JUST BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE,WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS AS JUST BACK OUR KNOWLEDGE
175,AND THEN WE PUT IT OUR HUNDRED GRAMS INTO ONE BIG BAG,AND THEN WE FUET OUR HUNDRE GAME LOS O ONE BIG BAG
176,UH A D A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS,AA POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS
177,YOU HAVE TO DEPEN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON,UT YE HAVE TO DEPEND IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON
178,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED
179,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILDRAM
180,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHING IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SUMTHOUT IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP
181,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME
182,MMM HMM AND THEN PUT THEM INTO A ONE BIG BAG AND THEN IT EQUALED ONE KILOGRAM,AND THEN PUT THEM INTO ONE BIG BAG NEE EQUAL TON KILSER
183,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF A TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WHEN IT'S ON,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OTA TOASTOR WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WEN IT'S ON
184,NO BECAUSE ALL PA THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE IT'D BE SMALL,NO BECAUSE I'LL PATHERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE I'D BE SMALL
185,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MATH MASS IS WITH WATER O A BOWL AND A VASE,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MOTH MASS IS WITH WATER A BOWL AND A VASE
186,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT
187,THEY MIGHT THINK BELIEVE ME BUT IF THEY'RE SMART THEY WOULDN'T,THEY MIGHT SINK BELIEVE ME BUT IF THEY'RE SMART THEY WOULDN'T
188,YES WHY THAT'S HELPFUL IS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS,YES AE WHY THAT'S HELPFUL US TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS
189,OVER TIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE ICE STARTED TO MELT,OVER TIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE ICE STARTED TO MELT
190,UM NOT REALLY NO BECAUSE IT'S S JUST ALL OF IT IS PHYSICS,IM NOT REALY ANO BECAUSE IT'S SOJUSET ALL OF IT AS PHYSICS
191,A IS THE HOTTEST B IS THE COLDEST COLD OVERWHELMS HOT,A IS THE HOTTEST BEES THE COLDEST COLD OVERWHELMS HOT
192,THIS IS A LINE GRAPH AND THIS I MEANS THAT THIS WAS,THIS IS A LINGRAPH AND THIS  MEANS THAT THIS WAS
193,YEAH RULERS ACTUALLY YOU LIKE IT IT'S LIKE A YARD STICK I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED MMM,A RULERS ACTUALLY LIKE I IT'S LIKE A YARDSTICK I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED
194,THE METRIC SYSTEM FOR THE CELSIUS THE REST OF THE WORLD USES THE METRIC SYSTEM AND AMERICA USES FAHRENHEIT,THE METRIC SYSTEM FOR THE SOUTHSEAS THE REST OF THE WORLD USES THE METRIC SYSTEM AND AMERICA USES FARONITE
195,AND THEN WHEN IT WHEN THIS DOT THAT'S AT TWO FOUR THAT'S LIKE AT EIGHT,AND THEN WHEN I EN THIS DAD THAT'S IT THAT'S LIKE AT EIGHT
196,WHAT'S GOING ON IS OVER LIKE ONE ONE HOUR IT WAS A RIGHT THERE,WHAT'S GOING ON IS OVER LIKE ONE ONE HOUR IT WAS RIGHT THERE
197,HOW OFTEN WHE DID WE DO THAT WE DID IT EVERY TEN MINUTES ACTUALLY EVERY HOUR,HOW OFTEN DID WE DO THAT WE DID IT EVERY TEN MINUTES ACTUALLY EVERY HOUR
198,WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS BELOW ZERO IT STARTS TO FREEZE,WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS BELOW ZERO IT STARTS TO FREEZE
199,NO IT'S GONNA START WARMING UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT,NO IT'S CAN NOT START WARMING UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT
200,WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIVE AND THEN FIFTY FIVE,WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIVE AND TE FIFTY FIVE
201,NO THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT ONE YES,NO THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THAT ONE YES
202,OH I MEAN ICE CUBES TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ICE AND THE WATER IN CELSIUS,OH I MEAN ICE CUBES TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ICE AND THE WATER INSELSIUS
203,OR THREE HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IN FAHRENHEIT,OR THREE HUNDRED DEGREES FARENHEIGHT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT INFIRNY
204,ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAPH YOU HAVE CELSIUS AND THIS YOU HAVE TIME IN MINUTES,ON THIS SIDE OOTHEGRAPH YOU HAVE SYLSIUS AND THIS YOU HAVE TIME AND MINUTES
205,TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE WE PUT TWO KILOGRAMS BAGS ON TWO KILOGRAM BRICKS ONTO IT,TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE WE PUT TWO KILOGRAM BAGS OR TWO KILEGRAM BRICKS ONTO
206,IT WASN'T TWO HUNDRED GRAMS BECAUSE THERE WAS FROM WATER UM I FORGOT WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE DID DO,WASN' TO UNDERGROUNS BECAUSE I WAS MADE FROM WATER OM I FORGET WHAT IS CALLED BUT WE DID DO
207,IT'S NOT A METER IT'S A UM SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE LITER IT'S,IT'S NOT A METER EGE SAY UP SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE LER
208,YEAH MILLILITER HOW I REMEMBER THAT IS THE MILLA IS THE LITER IS THE M KING OF THE MILLILITERS,YA A MILL LEADER HOW I REMEMBER THAT IS THE MILL IS THE LEADER IS THE KING OF THE MILLOW LEADERS
209,WITH THE PLUNGER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON IT EACH PLUNGER FULL IS FIFTY,WITH THE PUNGER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON EACH PLUNDERFULL IS FIFTY
210,IT WAS JUST TWO HUNDRED UH NOT TWO HUNDRED LITERS TWO HUNDRED,IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND NOT TWO HUNDRED LEADERS TWO HUNDRED
211,IT'S LIKE A HOLDING A THOUSAND REINS RAISINS IN YOUR HAND RAISINS,IT'S LIKE HOLDING A THOUSAND RAINS RAGASES IN YOUR HAND RASONS
212,WELL IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING LIQUID GRAMS WEIGHT,WELL IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WEVE BEEN LIKE MEASURING LIQUID RAM WAIT
213,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW HOW MANY UM,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW HOW MANY AM
214,YEAH AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY IT'D FILL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY MMM TWO HUNDRED,YE AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY ID TILLE UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED
215,HMM OKAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO,O CAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TU
216,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME,IT MADE ME THINK THA A YARDSTICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME
217,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,WILL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT AN MOUNTS TO
218,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WHILE THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FAULT IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS
219,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MOUTH GLASS
220,A HAN B A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TWENTY CENTIMETERS,HAN A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TRE ANMERS
221,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A ME THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN A METER SORRY,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A MA THER'S TEN CENTAMETER IMETER SO
222,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES LIKE THAT PIECE OF DUST
223,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT
224,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZE STRAWS
225,A HUN A HUNDRED YEAH AND THAT EQUALS A THOUSAND MMM HMM,HUNHUNDRED YACIA AND THAT EQUALS A THOUSAND AN THE SEQUALS A THOUSAND OE
226,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LITER TEN OF THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUALS ONE LITER,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN WOT THESE LEADER TEN OF THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUALS ONE LEADER
227,WELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER WE HAD,WELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER WE HAD
228,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCIANS OCA I DON'T I DON'T ULY REMEMBER VOLA
229,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING A PLAY WITH THE WATER
230,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS OF OUR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LEADER
231,WELL UM WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE,WELL I WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE
232,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
233,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WHILE THE MORE YOU RAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCE
234,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,E ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE VERBIT
235,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC DESTROVIESADMAR BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
236,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,TOMORO OM MID  YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENIN  THE STRENGTH IS IT GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
237,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT I SANLABOT A MEVLOGRAPH IS M NUMBERS
238,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,ERMA HAS TO FLOAT THROUGH A BASIN WATER AND A CASING WATER
239,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERE IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FORMING A PETIL AN ELIGHTFUL INEFABLE MASHANING WICE E REBRETH
240,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS RIGHT,IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UM IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE TIS ELECTRICITY WILL LIN OUT AND THER'S CERTAIN  KINDS OF DIFFEREN FOD BUT AN INSIDE IT SHINES BRIGHTER
241,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS TROU THE MATTER THO THE M TE LIGHT BALL
242,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IN SIENC IS LATING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BOLBS
243,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT,AND IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECUT INAR HE MICACO
244,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE HE SAYS RED ORSUPOS TO BE RED
245,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,ITS A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FTO A PRERSON
246,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIY KEEPS ON BUSHING OFF OF OBJECTS WOTH THE COLOR BLUE
247,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF AM LIGHT GREEN AND AM ORANGE BON IC YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIFE
248,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,ON NA UM I'LL ONCE BESO TEKNAT A NO RASHES TE BREAK IT
249,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNAT IS AN DE THE PAPEREDTOF NEPPROCLIPISUM TOPAN IT MOVES AT AR
250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN I JUST ENTERED ONE WASH E IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE  BECAUSE OF THE SPECERS
251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE OTHE SPECIS MADE TO FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSERVE HAPPENING IS LIKE AN INTEM PRESSING THE WASHES GOIN
253,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,OR WHATIT DOES IT MAKS TU O MATTER MAKES THEAMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
254,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE BIRD IS USED TA MAGNIT TO SOME OF THE PARTAY IS FORCED ENOUGH
255,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M TRYIN WHEN I GOT UP A TO HA MAK WASHAS I COULD GO UP TO THE I BROKE I TE FALL
256,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNE MIXTURE THROUGH AN ITIS REALLY REALLY NEO GET DOWN WITH THIS PLACEPLEASE
257,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,OET IS UPTE THAT WITH E ASSIGNED THINGS JUS
258,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,FOT I CAN SAY ABO TA IS TO ANY TEMD A MAGNET ON IT I  REACTS LIE
259,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHAT I BOLE ALONE WHO WO USED EFITETONOGATOR ISARTY TO FEKTECOPIN NAE
260,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE I JUST SEE THE SAMETHING YOUR DREAMY LAST NIGHT
261,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,WHY ARE YO SPSPETING MEAN MOVY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNANT THA NOW IN THE PAPER CLUP
262,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WOTLSOPAE IS IT STUCK INTO A NAIL AND IT CONNECT TEINTEPET A
263,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,WEN TO THE REGNADROPD IT WAN UNDOTHE TAPLE AND THEN THE MATIT STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET SCONDUCTING IT AND HOLDING IT
264,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS TE FORCE I CAN STILL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNETFORCE IS SO LIKE IT'S SO STRONG
265,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS RELOVED FROM THE NAIL AND LOE THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETIS
266,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP,TWHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A MEDL AND A PIECE O PAPER CLUB
267,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD UM PAPERCLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
268,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK LITITING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETI
269,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNUPTISM CROSSES OFF AND BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS MAKING IT
270,THE FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THEFORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
271,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS  LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONECT THE ENERGY TO GO THR
272,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOT OF A ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND LET THE LIGHT FALL
273,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THE ARE TE DUCALL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT B
274,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WENET WHATEVER'S HAD YOU JUST WHICH OTO IS STILL WORKS THE SAME WAY
275,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOES IN THE CIRCUIT IS HELP MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
276,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WAT ONE WIDER IS HEADING THROUGH THE PESAN WIRE ONE IT'S HEADING TO THE BASE WIER
277,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT TE SHUT UP IS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH EFOLD WIERS IN TO THE LIGHT
278,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A CIRCUIT CLYING ROUND AND ROUND THE LAKE WIT THE ELECTRICITY
279,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITIS BLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIGHT IN THE NEGATIVE SIGHT
280,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,LABLE TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
281,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THO CIRCET IT'S IMPORTANT THAT  CIRCETIN HOWIT UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
282,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,I AK SO MAGNET ICBECADO  PICK UP ANYTHING THATS IRIS
283,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,OTHE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE UP WERER IS O OM CLOSE
284,UM THE ROLE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SO,MINERAL OF AN ELECTRAL MAGNETS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCIT IS SO BUK
285,SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL,WASSHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SOMELIF TO A MIRERN NO WIL BE IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS I ON THE WALK
286,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION,AM BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF THE MIAR WHICH GIVES HIM SO HE COULDN'T PERCEIVE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
287,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT UM REFLECTIONS THERE ARE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE IT SHINE BRIGHTER,BY HOW THE DIFFEREN AM REFLECTIONS THE AR WO THE WERETHER ABLE TO SEE AN SHIME PRETTER
288,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND IT'S SETTING TO THE STAR,WHAT IS HAPPENING AS THOU WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OF DIFFERENT MYRS AN AT SETTING TO THE START IS MOI ESSNAP O  O
289,THE GUY HE FLICK THE SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHT,THEREBY HE FLICKED US WICH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
290,LIKE A MIRROR CAUSE SOMETIMES REFLECT IT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,LIKE A MARIC SOMETIMES REFLECTAN GO TO THE CENTR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
291,WHAT I KNOW IS UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULB LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IT ONE,WHAT I KNOW IS ON CERTAIN LIBALBS LIGHT BERD ARINS AND FOCUS IF ONE SPOT
292,IF ITS AND IN CONNECTS IF THIS HE DOES IN AND THEN A DOES EITHER,IF ITS ANIN ATER CONNECTS IF IT AS THE MESS IT DOESN'T AN IF IT'S AAOMAN IT DOES'T EITHER
293,I THINK WHAT IS ALL ABOUT IS SHE TRYING THE FINAL WAY I GUESS NORTH OR SOUTH,I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUADRANTS IN THE EARTH
294,WHAT YOU THING MORE THAN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB WENT OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECT,AN WHAT I HAN PUD HEP WITH THIS PICTURE I OM O OL IN THE MIDDLE THE AV LIPE BRINKED OUT IN E WAV STILKY NECK TIL RECOPISI NOT CONNECTED WITH THE OTHER ONE
295,BEESLY WIRE THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDLE THING,WAS NOT LAD UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MEDL THING
296,LAST YEARLY MEANS THAT ELECTRICITY WHAT GO OTHER ONE IS ELECTRICITY THAT EASY,RAUS AIE WILIAR YE MEAN IT IS TAD TO MUCH ELECTRICITY WENT THROUGH AN OTHER ONS O THE COMFIMDI A TI USPANNEL EPTICITY IN THAT YAS
297,THE WIRE THE ELECTRICITY THOSE THAT'S GOING IS BECAUSE AN LIGHT BULB OF OUT,THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRICIITO PLO STOPS GOING IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BOKS AR BURND OUT
298,WHAT I THINK MORE HAPPENS IS ELECTRICITY GOES STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND LIGHT BULB IS STOP STOP LIGHTING UP,WHAT I THINK WE W HAPTEN IS I THE ELECTRICITY WOT WILL STOP FLYING THROUGH AND THE LIGHT BAL PESO STOP LIGHTING UP
299,HAPPENS IS AND THE FILM WAS GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND WHAT IS ACTION,RAPINS LAS WE TO REPEAT AND THE FILEMENT WILL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DEG AND AVENTUUS
300,IT MAY BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE A CONNECT INTO LINE THE,IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT FINEX IT'LL LIGHT UP WILL IT RAC THA
301,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THAT IS NO LIKE I MEAN,WHY DO I THINK THIS EXIST BECAUSE THE FHILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN ELECTE ATR
302,HE REASON LIKE THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEM FINAL RECHARGE IN THE WIRE LIKE ITS,THE REASON WHY CONTHET IS BARNY IT'S BECAUSE LEMAS FINALLY TURKSIN THE WIRE LIK AT SUPPOSED TO
303,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THERE REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH DIFFERENT NEW ONE,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THEY REPLACE AD BETTER E WITH A DIFFERENT NEW ONE
304,I WILL CHECKS BY LIGHT BULBS I GUESS TWO OR ONE LIGHT BULB AND MORE LIGHTUP WORK,I WUT HAVE SUCH A SINGULAR SAMES FIVE LIKEOF AND I GUESS TO OR WAT MY TOLD AND  SOME OF EM WILL LIGHT UP OER THATS VEY FAIRLY
305,WHAT WE NOT DIFFERENCED BUT LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY HE WAS SWITCH SIDE,BUT LEYA TA IS PISTE A NEER SAI MIN AN O TAANCTOSE E LAT BOO FA TO BAKIE LI OVER MA CHILD IN ORDER TO TE LIGHTBALLS LAGD EFFISES AN A TE ONOD OIT WAS WHICH HE SAID
306,WHAT HAPPENING THIS ENERGY IS JUST WASTING ON INTO THE AIR BECAUSE THOSE NOW ELECTRICITY INTO,WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ENERGY IS JUST WASTING AINTO TAR BECAUSE TERS NOWER TOPUN BY ELECTRICITY INTO
307,CIRCUIT LIGHT IS THE SERIES AND IT ADD SUCH ONE WIRE CONNECTED,PESENCO TO E SECAVA LIA THE SERIES SINIT TE A LEAST HAVE TO BE ONE WIRE CONNECTED
308,WHAT INTO THE ELECTRICITY WENT TO THE ONE OF THE CIRCUIT WENT TO THE ITS STOPPED WORKING,WA INTA THE ELECTRICITY FRENDS AT ONE OF THE CIRCUT PUS PA EME BUNID AUT OM IT STOPPED WORKING
309,HAVE BEEN WHEN I NOTICE ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB WILL WORK AND OTHER ONE HAS IS,HAT OM TRAING OUT ISEKEO TE REPUPL ONE OF THE WRIHT BEING WOR THE PAG OF A MAN IS INTALPEN
310,BUT I NOTICE ONE LIGHT BULB THIS LIGHTING UP THIS IT IS RIGHT,WUT I NOTICED SOMEHOW LAK ONE MY PULPAS RIDING UP OM THE FILDER AND E SUTHERN TOWER IN IDS NOT RECKEN AT ALL
311,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE'S NO MAGNET IN
312,AND NOTE FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NOT DISSOLVE,AIN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO A BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
313,THINGS THAT STICK MAGNET OR EITHER METAL AND ONCE USUALLY PACKED PLASTIC,THE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET ARE EITHER MA METAL AND THE ONES ARE USALY PACKED PLASTIC OR WOOD
314,THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK,THE PAPER FASINER STAYS ON THESTEEL MAL AND THE BLACK ROCK
315,IT GOES THROUGH HOW THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONE GOES BACK INTO IT,OM IT GOES THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE LINES GOES BACK INTO IT
316,THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,ITHINK WHAT HAPPEND IS THE ELECTRICITY ITS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH H LYPOBS
317,WHAT THE HAVE THEY COMPARED IS SETUP DIFFERENTLY STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY,OWONER HOW THEY COMPARE IS ER SET UP DIFFERENT WAYS BUT STILL LID UP THE SAME WAY
318,I THINK I GUESS THE WHY I AM THE MADE CHOICES,I THINK I GUESS THE BOTTOMEN THEM OUT OF CHOICES BUT
319,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WELL IN A SERI CICET IT HAS SBETE ELECTRICITY HAS STOPPED GO STOP GO BUT IN THE PERILESS WE PEPLE GOES AROUND AND THE CO AG AN BACKI
320,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOUR AND IN ASERI CIRCET BOL THERE IS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE ONE
321,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,PUT AN NOTICE ABOUT THE PAFLA IS THE ENERGY IS TO COME OMBEFOR DIFFERENT CONNECSU
322,WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WHICH BEST ONE NOW I GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BETTERY AND ONE LIPAR BECAUSE THERE'S NOT WASTE AN ENERGY
323,THE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THE CONNECTED RIGHT,A UM THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP BECAUSE THE WAY TT SGOING COULD HAVE  CONNECT TO THE RAT
324,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,OLAN NOTICED AS ENERGY WAS BLOWING OUTUNDE THE BATTERY THAT'S GOING INTO THE BATTERY
325,IF THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS,THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIE CIRCUITS
326,THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,AMTHE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGT BULPSE THEY LIGHT UP IT BURNTS OUT AND YOU HAVE TO REPLACE WITH ANOTHER ONE
327,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ON CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALOSICUDS HAVE MORE
328,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,BEEN LEARNING IN TINS OM PARALLEL CIRCITS AND SERI CIRCIT
329,OH SO IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND,OH SO IT'S GOING TO GO THROUGH THE BASE IN UP THE FILEMENTS AND DOWN AND
330,UM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO,AM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO
331,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP,M THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP
332,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WILL FLOW THROUGH,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY O FLOA THROUGH
333,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE
334,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH IS IT A CIRCUIT,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH THE LITTLE CIRCUIT
335,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT,YA HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AN STUFF YES WE DID THAT
336,IT MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS METISO STRONG THE MAGNET IS
337,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS,AM WHEL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS
338,BECAUSE THE SOUTHS CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE THEY WOULD PUSH AWAY,BECAUSE THE SOUTH CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE TI WOULD PUSH AWAY
339,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET,WI MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO AIT IS ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
340,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELEC IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELIT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
341,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNET STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
342,THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPERCLIP MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK,THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONDUCTING TO THE PAPER CLIF MAKING THE PAPER CUP STICK
343,WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES 'EM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES,ELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES HEM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ON IT MOVES
344,WELL BECAUSE THE DIS THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK,WL BECAUSE THE DIST OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK
345,ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON,ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
346,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE,THE ELECTRO MAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN  GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
