174,UM WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS IS JUST BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE,WAITED ITO THE SO CLASS THIS WAS JUST BACK OUR KNOWLEDGE
175,AND THEN WE PUT IT OUR HUNDRED GRAMS INTO ONE BIG BAG,AND THEN WE PUTED OUR HUNDRED GAME IT ONE BIG BAG
176,UH A D A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS,AH A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRIMS
177,YOU HAVE TO DEPEN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON,YOU HAVE TO DEPEND IN DEPEND ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON
178,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED
179,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQULES A KILDRIM
180,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHING IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP,I SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHIN TIS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP
181,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME
182,MMM HMM AND THEN PUT THEM INTO A ONE BIG BAG AND THEN IT EQUALED ONE KILOGRAM,AND THEN PUT THEM INTO ONE BIG BAG NEVER EQUALED ONE KILLED THEM
183,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF A TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WHEN IT'S ON,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NIGHT WHEN IT WAS ON
184,NO BECAUSE ALL PA THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE IT'D BE SMALL,NO BECAUSE OU PAE THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPSE BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE SHOULD BE SMALL
185,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MATH MASS IS WITH WATER O A BOWL AND A VASE,HOW DO YOU MEAS YOURE MOUTH MASS IS WITH WATER A BOWL AND A VASE
186,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT,IT'S PRETTY LIGHT SO IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN USED A LOT
187,THEY MIGHT THINK BELIEVE ME BUT IF THEY'RE SMART THEY WOULDN'T,THEY MIGHT SING BELIEVE ME BUT IF THERE'S MART THEY WOULDN'T
188,YES WHY THAT'S HELPFUL IS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS,YES IWAS WHY LET'S HELP US TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS
189,OVER TIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE ICE STARTED TO MELT,OVERTIME IT GOT HOTTER AND THE EYES STARTED TO MELT
190,UM NOT REALLY NO BECAUSE IT'S S JUST ALL OF IT IS PHYSICS,I' NOT REALIAN NO BECAUSE IT'S JUST ALL  ITIS PHYSICS
191,A IS THE HOTTEST B IS THE COLDEST COLD OVERWHELMS HOT,A IS THE HOTTEST BES THE COLDEST COLD OVER WALMS HOT
192,THIS IS A LINE GRAPH AND THIS I MEANS THAT THIS WAS,THIS IS A LIN GRAPH AND VIS IT I MEANS THAT THIS WAS
193,YEAH RULERS ACTUALLY YOU LIKE IT IT'S LIKE A YARD STICK I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED MMM,AND RULERS ACTUALLY LIKE IT IT'S LIKE A YARD STICK I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S COME
194,THE METRIC SYSTEM FOR THE CELSIUS THE REST OF THE WORLD USES THE METRIC SYSTEM AND AMERICA USES FAHRENHEIT,THE METRIC SYSTEM FOR THE SELSES THE REST OF THE WORLD USES THE MATRIC SYSTEM AND AMERICA USES FARENIT
195,AND THEN WHEN IT WHEN THIS DOT THAT'S AT TWO FOUR THAT'S LIKE AT EIGHT,AND THEN WHEN IT WHEN THIS DOT THATS AT THAT'S I GIT EIGHT
196,WHAT'S GOING ON IS OVER LIKE ONE ONE HOUR IT WAS A RIGHT THERE,WHAT'S GOING ON IS OVER LIKE ONE ONE HOUR IT WAS RIGHT THERE
197,HOW OFTEN WHE DID WE DO THAT WE DID IT EVERY TEN MINUTES ACTUALLY EVERY HOUR,HOW OFTENDID WE DO THAT WE DID IT EVERY TEN MINUTES ACTUALLY EVERY HOUR
198,WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS BELOW ZERO IT STARTS TO FREEZE,WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GETS BELOWSER IT STRETCS TO FREEZ
199,NO IT'S GONNA START WARMING UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT,NO IS GINNOT START WARMING UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YO MEMBER THAT
200,WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIVE AND THEN FIFTY FIVE,WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIVE AND FIFTY FIVE
201,NO THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT ONE YES,NO THIS WANES A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT ONE YES
202,OH I MEAN ICE CUBES TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ICE AND THE WATER IN CELSIUS,OH I MEAN ICE CUBES TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ICE AND THE WATER IN SELSIOS
203,OR THREE HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IN FAHRENHEIT,OR THREE HUNDRED DEGREES FARENEIT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT INF
204,ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAPH YOU HAVE CELSIUS AND THIS YOU HAVE TIME IN MINUTES,ON THIS SIDE OTEGRAPH YE HAVE SELSIUS AND THIS YE HAVE TIME AND MINUTE
205,TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE WE PUT TWO KILOGRAMS BAGS ON TWO KILOGRAM BRICKS ONTO IT,TWO THOUSAND BUT BECAUSE WE PUT TWO KILAGRAM BAGS LAT TWO KILGRAN BRICKS ONTO
206,IT WASN'T TWO HUNDRED GRAMS BECAUSE THERE WAS FROM WATER UM I FORGOT WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE DID DO,LISM TWO UNDERGROUNDS BECAUSE IT WAS RAY FROM WATER ON I FORGET WHAT IS CALLED BUT WE DID DO
207,IT'S NOT A METER IT'S A UM SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE LITER IT'S,ITS NOT A METER ITSAY U SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE GLETERANCE
208,YEAH MILLILITER HOW I REMEMBER THAT IS THE MILLA IS THE LITER IS THE M KING OF THE MILLILITERS,GAMILLA LEADER HOW I REMEMBER THAT IS THE MILL IS THE LEADER IS THE KING O THE MILLO LEADERS
209,WITH THE PLUNGER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON IT EACH PLUNGER FULL IS FIFTY,WITH A PLUNDER IT HAS DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON EACH PLUNDERFUL IS FIFTY
210,IT WAS JUST TWO HUNDRED UH NOT TWO HUNDRED LITERS TWO HUNDRED,IT AS TWO HUNDRED AND NOT TWO HUNDRED LEADERS TWO HUNDRED
211,IT'S LIKE A HOLDING A THOUSAND REINS RAISINS IN YOUR HAND RAISINS,IT'S LIKE HOLDING A THOUSAND RAINS RAGASES IN HER HAND RAISINS
212,WELL IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING LIQUID GRAMS WEIGHT,WHILE IN MEASUREMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING WIKUID BRAM WAIT
213,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW HOW MANY UM,WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WAS WE SAW AT HELM MANY OM
214,YEAH AND IT WE SAW HOW MANY IT'D FILL UP TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY MMM TWO HUNDRED,YE AND IWE SAW HOW MANY IT TIVLOPED TO AND IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED
215,HMM OKAY WELL WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO,HUM I'L CET WHILE WE ESTIMATED NUMBERS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT IT TOOK TO
216,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS THE SAME,IT MADE ME THINK THAT A YARD STICK WOULD MAKE A BETTER MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
217,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYIG MEASUREMENT AMOUNTS TO HIM
218,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WHILE THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FALL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS
219,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MASS TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MASTH CLASS
220,A HAN B A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TWENTY CENTIMETERS,AND HAND AD A HAND WOULD ME NOT A METER BUT LENGTH LISE ANMIEARS
221,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A ME THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN A METER SORRY,THEREIS TIN MEDES AN INAMY THE OST TIN SIDE AMANGEMENT METER SI
222,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MY INSTRUMENT YES LI RAT PIECS OF DUST
223,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE WE HAD TO MEASURE IT
224,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT CIE STRAWS
225,A HUN A HUNDRED YEAH AND THAT EQUALS A THOUSAND MMM HMM,HUND HUNDRED YAYA AND DATY QOLLS A TOUSAN AND THE SICK AS O THOUSAND S
226,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LITER TEN OF THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES EQUALS ONE LITER,WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE IS TEN OF THESE LEADER TUNER THESE SMALL LITTLE ONES IT GOES ONE LEADER
227,WELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER WE HAD,WHELL WHEN WE POURED THEM INTO A BIGGAR CONTENER WE HAD
228,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,IT'S THE LENGH BETWEEN TWO OCHANS I DON'T I DON'T ONLY REMEMBER BULYA
229,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING A PLAY WITH THE WATER
230,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE WERE MASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LEADER
231,WELL UM WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE,WELL I WHAT I LIKE MENTIONING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE
232,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
233,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MARE Y RAPID AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENAGY GETS FORCED
234,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,YO ACCOMPLISHE THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE ROUND THE RIT
235,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU ARE ON MAKER LEK TREMOR THE STROMERS AD MAR BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TONEGATIVE
236,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THE MORE AM MIND YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENED AT THE STRENGTH IS ITS GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
237,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT IS YOUNG ABOUT A METLOGRAPH IS UMNUMBERS
238,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,BUT AMAN HAS TO FILL THROUGH A VASIN WIRE AN ECASING WAY
239,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,E A WE NOT HEARD OUT DISCOVERY IS THEREOF CISTEN MIV NOW PLUMMING A PRO AT A RIHT BOD THE ELDOM OF MY JINING WITHDRE VERY BREATH
240,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS RIGHT,BELIVEREN BECAUSE EM IF WE JUST HAD WHEN IT IN AN ACCUSTODABLE VIMO AND TE SITTING ONTHE PONS A I TE HARLD A HEL THAT AN INSIDE IT STRING TO NITER
241,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ANDRER THE MATTER THE RUM THAT AM LIHTBAL
242,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING SANTICIATING BOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIPLE
243,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT,AN LET IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT FOR BE CUT ENER HE MIGHT ITOUT
244,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED BU MOST BE RED
245,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FORTWO PERSON
246,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIKE POMBACHING OFF OF OBJECTS TE BOSO COLOR BLUE
247,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF ALIGHT GREEN HAND ON ORANGE BOOK TI YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT
248,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,ON NAT UM I'LL ONE SPEAS HER TIKNIGHT UH AN I RESSHERS TO BREAK
249,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNETISA NEWSPAPER ETOF THE CLIPISUM TOP AND ROSEDER
250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN IT ISETRED WHEN WASH EBER ETS FA BECAS OVE  BECAUSE OFTHE SPEACER
251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORSTAN THE SPECIES MADE TO FORCE TE LITTLE BED WEAKER
252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WOUT I OBTERVE HAPPENI IS I COUD INTEND PRESSING THE WASHERS GOIN
253,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,OR WHAT A JUDGEMENT MAKEES TE A MATTER MAKES THE UM A MOUNT TOLLER AND THAT HELPS AT MAKES IT EVEN
254,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE PETISUSE TO MAKE IT TO SOME OF TLY IS HORSTENOUGH
255,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M CHANK WHEN I GOT UP E TO HI MAK WASHES IT CAN GO UP TO THE EBROKE CAL
256,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TE MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNEMMICTURE THROUGH AN AGISTIRELLY RELLY NE ARCIT DON AT THIS POICE PLEASE
257,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,PORMET IS A THAT THAT WIT THAT ASIGN THINGS TO
258,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,BUT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT TE ANY TERM THE MAGNET ON A REACT LI
259,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,IN WHAT A O ALONE LOO IS ITE MOCTE ISUALDE TO VICICOPENNANER
260,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE JUST SEE THE SAMETHING YOURIS REAMY LAST NIGHT
261,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,O MOR A SPOSPISURING MEA MONVY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNENT THE AON THE PAPERCLUCK
262,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,LITTLE SOMPINY IS IT STUCKIN TO AN AIR AND ITCANNAT GOOD TAPER I
263,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,WEN TO THEREG NATURE OPT HEE ADOTHER TAPE ON AN THE MATET STICK BERE BECAUSE OF TA MAGONET SCONNUCTIN UNHOLDIN
264,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,BUT IS HAPPENING AS THE FOR SAID CN STILL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNET FORCE IS SO LIKE IT SO STRONG
265,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MARGNANS WERE FROM THE NAIL AND VIS THE NAIL OU LOSES ITS MAGNETIS
266,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP,THAT'S GOING ON HERAS THE MEAD AND A PIECE OF PAPERCLIP
267,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD A PAPERCLEB PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
268,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT ATRAINES IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETIS
269,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING ISTE MAGNITISM PRESSES OFF AND BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS MAGINATED
270,THE FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,TH FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER O MAKE IT MOVE UNDERSTUFF
271,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL AIR HELP LIGHT IT UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY THE
272,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS NOT OF ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND LET THE LIGHT FALL
273,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE ARK TAT YOU SHALL BETTERY WIRS AND A LIGHT
274,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHEN IT WHATEVER HAVE YOU JUST RIGED YOU IS DIRECTS THE SAME
275,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHET A WIRE DOESEN A CIRCUITS HELP MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BETTERY
276,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,ANWHA A ONE RIDE IS HIDDEN THROUGH THE POSSE WIR ON IS GITTING TO THE BASE MYER
277,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT TO SHED UP ASED ITS GOING THROUGH BULLS UNFEAUTFUL MYERS ENINTO THE LIGHT
278,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A CIRCUIT CLYING ROUND AND ROUND THE LAKE IWIT THE ELECTRICITY
279,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITIES FLELLING THROUGH TEPOSITIVE SID  THE NEGATIVE SIDE
280,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,LAY BOK TO BE RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
281,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,GOCIRCIS IMPORTING BAT CIRCUITIN HOW ITS OM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
282,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,W E ATERNED MAGNETIC I BE CARE ON O PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRISH
283,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,ON  THE WATCHERS WON'T STICK TO IT AN TIL THE UP WHERER IS  ON CLOSE
284,UM THE ROLE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SO,INANARROLE OF ANELECTURAL MAGNETIS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SAVIR
285,SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL,WAS THE SHES REFLECTIN IN THA SOMLIKE TON EEURN NOBOVY MAMERA AN IT SHELS  ON THE WALK
286,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION,HEM BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OF THE MIRROR WHICH GIVES HIM SO EMA TOSEIE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
287,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT UM REFLECTIONS THERE ARE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE IT SHINE BRIGHTER,BY HOW THEY GIVEN THEM REFLECTIONS AT OUR GROW THE WORTHER ABLE TO SEE TE SHAN PRATER
288,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND IT'S SETTING TO THE STAR,OWHAT IS HAPPENING IS THOUGH AND THE LIGH IS REFLECTING OF DIFFERENT MERISAN AT SETTING TO HE STAR IS NSAN SNAP M
289,THE GUY HE FLICK THE SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHT,THE GIHY FLICTERS WHICH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
290,LIKE A MIRROR CAUSE SOMETIMES REFLECT IT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,LIKE O MA A SOMETIME REFLECT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOM LIKE TA
291,WHAT I KNOW IS UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULB LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IT ONE,WHAT I KNOW THESE THE UNCERTAIN LIBULBS LIE BRED AIR AND AND FOCUS HAD ONCE BOUGHT
292,IF ITS AND IN CONNECTS IF THIS HE DOES IN AND THEN A DOES EITHER,IF ITS AN AN ASSAR CONNECTS IF ITS ESTINES IT DOESN'T IN IF IT EMENON IT DOES IT EITHER
293,I THINK WHAT IS ALL ABOUT IS SHE TRYING THE FINAL WAY I GUESS NORTH OR SOUTH,A THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUADRONS IN THE EARTH
294,WHAT YOU THING MORE THAN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB WENT OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECT,ONEY OR I NOT A ANQUITHEAD WITH IS CONTINU A HUNEMATTER  FOLLIN THE MIDDLE  BA INDE IE LAPE BRINKED OUT AND THER WAST TILTI NEC TE RECOGNIZIN A HEA THROW THE ETE
295,BEESLY WIRE THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDLE THING,IT WAS NOW LAD UP BBECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MEDDL THING
296,LAST YEARLY MEANS THAT ELECTRICITY WHAT GO OTHER ONE IS ELECTRICITY THAT EASY,LAST IONNE E MEAN IN SAD TO MAKE A LECTITU TO MY THROUGOUT ATER MY OSPE ONHIN IN FIL AN O OFF IF TOTIN ME THAT NEW
297,THE WIRE THE ELECTRICITY THOSE THAT'S GOING IS BECAUSE AN LIGHT BULB OF OUT,THE REASON WHY THE LEXUSY AVE CLOSE TOP SCOING IT'S  BECAUSE YO ANTETER I BOBURNT OUT
298,WHAT I THINK MORE HAPPENS IS ELECTRICITY GOES STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND LIGHT BULB IS STOP STOP LIGHTING UP,WHUT I THINK BOHARGAN AME IT THE ARECTACITYWL BO STOP LYING THRI AND  LIKE BULPESELL STOP LIGHTING UP
299,HAPPENS IS AND THE FILM WAS GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND WHAT IS ACTION,RABIN W THE WENT REPEATY AND THE FIRAMENT WILL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN INTO THE INTEREST
300,IT MAY BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE A CONNECT INTO LINE THE,IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BAS THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE EVENINGS ITALITE UP IN ONLYRY DO THAT
301,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THAT IS NO LIKE I MEAN,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS THIS BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN ELECTYTE TR
302,HE REASON LIKE THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEM FINAL RECHARGE IN THE WIRE LIKE ITS,THE REASON WHY COT THAT IS BARNEY ITS BECAUSE LEM IS FINALLY TURCING THE WIRELECT AND SUPPOSE
303,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THERE REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH DIFFERENT NEW ONE,FOR THIS BEING SHOWN HE HAS TE REPLACE AD BETTERY WITH HE DIFFERENT NEW ONE
304,I WILL CHECKS BY LIGHT BULBS I GUESS TWO OR ONE LIGHT BULB AND MORE LIGHTUP WORK,THE WULTEST UC A PECUNIAR TIN IS DEFIED LY OVSN AND I GUESS TO WERE WAN MY HELD AND ASMAMUMULINA BOAR AT OI VALIN
305,WHAT WE NOT DIFFERENCED BUT LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY HE WAS SWITCH SIDE,WWHAT LEA AT TE TIN O I NA ROLING AND YOU DIIN TO SAY IT NOTO A FOTO BACK ERY OF EMO CHILD IN WHAT I  TE IGT WASLY ENOUGH OF YOU AND NOW OAL HELP ME WAS WHICH HE SAID
306,WHAT HAPPENING THIS ENERGY IS JUST WASTING ON INTO THE AIR BECAUSE THOSE NOW ELECTRICITY INTO,WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ENERGY LUSES WASTING ALIN TER BECAUSE TOLS NUMBERGE AN ELECTRICITY ANTO AR
307,CIRCUIT LIGHT IS THE SERIES AND IT ADD SUCH ONE WIRE CONNECTED,PISER PITON A SICEDEL LI IN THE SEORIES SHOULD TIT THE AT LEAS HAVE TO BE ONE WIRE CONNECTED
308,WHAT INTO THE ELECTRICITY WENT TO THE ONE OF THE CIRCUIT WENT TO THE ITS STOPPED WORKING,WHAT INPTATA A HIS ANYTHING ITHOUT ONE OTHER SIRCIN HIS HAND RUE BANO LAUG HUM IT TAB WORKIN
309,HAVE BEEN WHEN I NOTICE ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB WILL WORK AND OTHER ONE HAS IS,ETEN ADONRN OTI FOR LOOKERYBO IF ONE OF THE WRITER NAME ROUNDED BY THE LANAA A AN PAL HIM
310,BUT I NOTICE ONE LIGHT BULB THIS LIGHTING UP THIS IT IS RIGHT,WUT I NOWT A TUMBLE AN ONE MIGHT WELP IS WRITING UP IN THE THIR AND CHILDRN TOWR AND  NOT RECKON AT ALL
311,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET I
312,AND NOTE FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NOT DISSOLVE,AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO AN BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
313,THINGS THAT STICK MAGNET OR EITHER METAL AND ONCE USUALLY PACKED PLASTIC,THE THINGS SAT SICK TO MAGNET ARE ETHER MAAM MEDAL AND THE ONES ARE EASULY PRACTIC PLASTER GERWIT
314,THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK,THE PA PEROFESSONER STAYS ON AND THE STEEL MAL AND THE BLACK ROC
315,IT GOES THROUGH HOW THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONE GOES BACK INTO IT,FROM IT GOES THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE LIND GOES BACK INTO IT
316,THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS THE ELECTRICITY ITS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTT LIPLOBS
317,WHAT THE HAVE THEY COMPARED IS SETUP DIFFERENTLY STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY,I WONDER HOW THEY COMPARE IS YUST SET UP DIFFERENT WAYS BUT STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY
318,I THINK I GUESS THE WHY I AM THE MADE CHOICES,I THINK I GUESS THE BUTTEMEN DAM AD CHOICES BUT
319,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WHILE IN A SERIOUS AGAY A HATIGEN IT MANY ERECTICITY  STAP GOS HAP GO BUT IN A PARILOUS WII BLOS ROUND AND NECON RAD AND BAC TO
320,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOR AND IN A SERIOUS CIRCUIT WHILE THERE IS ONLY ISPOSIBLY ONE
321,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,REEN NOTICE BOUT THE PATRANG IL BE ENERGY  FOR DIFON
322,WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WOULD BE MUCH BEST ONE NOW HE GUESS IS THOUGH ONE WITH A BETTER AND ONE MIGHT BOL BECAUSE THERE IS NOT WASTE AN ENERGY
323,THE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THE CONNECTED RIGHT,S A UM IN THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP I  THE WAY T SCOIN COCONNECTED WRITIN
324,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,TOWN ELL I NOTICE ASN'T ANY HER WIT BOILING YO UNDE BATTERY IT'S GOING INTO THE BATTER
325,IF THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS,THE KINDS OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ITS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERY CIRCUITS
326,THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,UMTHE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIKE BULPS A THEY LIGHT UP IT BRNKS OUT AND YET TO REPLEX WITH ANOTHER ONE
327,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK ITS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ON CONNECTIONS TO IT IN PARALLES IT ATAPHMOL
328,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,BEEN LEARNING AN SINS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERY CIRCUIT
329,OH SO IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND,O SO IT'S GOING TO GO FOR Y OF A MASE AN UP THE FILLIMMAN SAT DOWN AND
330,UM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO,IMIT CAN GO FERY LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SI
331,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP,HUM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHA TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WORMS THE FILAMMENTS UP
332,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WILL FLOW THROUGH,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTROCY OF FLOAT THROUGH
333,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE
334,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH IS IT A CIRCUIT,OM I FORGOT WHAT THEY RE CALL TUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH LIT U CIRCUIT
335,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT,YAH HOW TO LIE MAKE IT WORK ANSTO YES BUT DID THAT
336,IT MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,MADISUSTERN THE MAGNETIS MEDISOSTRN THE MAGNETIS
337,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS,IM WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORESTS OF MAGNUTS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS
338,BECAUSE THE SOUTHS CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE THEY WOULD PUSH AWAY,BECAUSE THE SOUTH CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE OF PUSHWAT
339,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET,WAL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNETS
340,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELEC IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELECT IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
341,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
342,THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPERCLIP MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK,THE MAGNETIC VOICES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONDECTING TO THE PAPER CLIFF MAKING THE PAPER CUT STICK
343,WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES 'EM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES,WHILE THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSSING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES SIM STICK AN IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES
344,WELL BECAUSE THE DIS THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK,BON'T BECAUSE THE DISIS A MAGNETIC FORICT DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK
345,ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON,E ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
346,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE,THE LECTRO MAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
