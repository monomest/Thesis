1277,UM WE'VE BEEN UH LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS,UM WE'VE BEEN UH LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND U SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1278,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THERE IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART,SOMER TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITEWAY SO THEY IS A FORCE THER THAT PUSHES THEM APART
1279,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UH USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT 'EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UM USE FOR LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT UEMS UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK
1280,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROSS THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THSINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THAE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
1281,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1282,WELL W WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN 'EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN 'EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT THE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WOR THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE,WELL WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATRACT THEY IF YOU TURN THEM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH AP APART BUT IF YOU TURN THEM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'R RIGHT IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART ECAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE
1283,WELL THEY'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT 'EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO LI IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO,WELL THERE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT IM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO BUT IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WAN'T IT TO
1284,AGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL,IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL
1285,THERE'S A FORCE THAT PU THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS 'EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER,ERE'S A FORCE THERE' THAT PULL THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLES THEM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER IF SINCE THE'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND SANCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER
1286,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET MEANS IT'LL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT'S BE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET IT MEANS THAT IT WILL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN OF OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTS
1287,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOME THICK THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOME THING'S IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME BIG THINGS CAN M LIKE SOMETHING THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOMETHINGS IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THINK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE
1288,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETI THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND IT'LL STAY ON THE NAIL,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETIC THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TOGH THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND IT'LLE STAY ON THE NAIL
1289,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT N IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT IT'S ON IT AND THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCE IT DESN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT  IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANT MAGNET IT'S ON IT AND THEN THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET

1541,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW ENERGY SHOULD,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW ENERGYUR
1542,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BECAUSE THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BECAUSE THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
1543,THE ENERGY CAN FLOW TO THE OTHER ONE,THE ENERGY CAN FLOW TO THE OTHER ONE
1544,UHM IT DOESN'T REALLY END UP,OH IT DOESN'T REANG IT
1545,IT ALL STOPS,IT ALL STOP
1546,THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME,THEY'REIN A SERIES CIRCUIT CAUSE WHAT'S YOUR NAME
1547,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BACK TO THE,IT IS CLOSED SO NOW EVERYTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BACK TO THEYAY
1548,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS ON THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY BECAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS,ALL THE ENERGY STOPS THE ONE THAT'S BROKEN AND THE OTHER ONE IS STILL GOING WITH ENERGY BECAUSE THIRE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAY
1549,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BURN OUT IT TURNS INTO AN OPEN CIRCUIT,WHEN ONE OF THE BULBS BURND OUT IT TURNS INTO AN OPEN CIRCUIT
1550,INTO THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTO,INTO THE CIRCUIT TURNS INTO
1551,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK
1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANYTHING
1553,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT
1554,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES OUND AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A
1555,THAT THREE WIRES ON SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE,THAT THE THREE WIRES ON ONE SIDE IF SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE BATTER
1556,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK,I THINK IS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK
1557,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS
1558,I KNOW THAT THEY'RE PARALLEL LINES,I KNOW THAT'S HI'R PARALLEL LIGHT
1559,THE SECOND CIRCUIT,THE SECOND CIRCUIT
1560,GOOD,GOOD
1561,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUG
1562,THEN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT'S NOT BURNT OUT,AN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT IS NOT BURNED OUNT
1563,WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS,WHEN THE FOUNDN IT BREAKS ILI LO
1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,WE OD ZERI   PATIRN TS
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BECAUSE THO TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,THE FTMIS AT WORKING AND ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONE'S YOU GET A RPRIT ILMENT THE BULB AS CTARTIN ADO BU WATER WORKING
1567,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONCE SA THE ENERGY
1569,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN A FASE SO CAN WE HURRY UP
1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT THE ENGE
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE THA SWITCH IS A
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,THAT SENSE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CANT FLOAW TO THE OTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,I KNOST THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES TO THE T RA AN THAT THAT THAT O THE HAT THAT THEA THE THEAT
1574,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,WELL THEY DO THAT WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW CE A MAY PROVEP
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,SORY CIRCUIT SOY SOD CIS CAN ARE A BIG CIRCLE PLUCK A INAIND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUIT
1578,WHAT THE ENERGY FLOWING ONE,WITH THE ENERGY FLOWING ONES WATER
1579,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T MATTER,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T MATTER
1580,I KNOW IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS ON,IO IT'S A COL OD THE SECOND BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS UH WAYFU
1581,THROUGH FILAMENTS AREN'T,THRO FILAMENTS ARE
1582,A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T
1583,I THINK THE BULB IS NOT LIT UP BECAUSE IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OPEN,I THINK THE BULB WES NOT LET UP BECAUSE IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS ABUL PL
1584,WHAT'S YOUR NAME,WHAT'S YOUR NAME
1585,ONE LIGHT BULB'S HAVING TOO,ONE LIGHT BULB IS HAVING TWO MR
1586,THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED TO THE D CELL,THE ROCK CONNECTED TO THE D CELL
1587,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER DOESNT SO THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY
1588,THAT ONE OF THEM IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILAMENT IS,THAT ONE OF THEM IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILAMENT IS BUR
1589,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S AWESOME,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS ALSO
1590,BECAUSE THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT,BECAUSE A SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT
1591,STOP STOPS GLOWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB,STOP IT STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB
1592,THAT,THAT A
1593,WE TOOK SOME STEEL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ATTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE TOOK SOME STEEL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ATTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T
1594,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPAS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRIED USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD BLIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP
1595,THEY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE,IT DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAPING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UN DONE
1596,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL TIMES BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
1597,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP,IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHE IT AND BROT IT UP
1598,THE NAILS AND THE PAPER CLIP,THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP
1599,SINCE THEY ATTRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS,SINCE THEY DETRACT THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES PENDING APON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS
1600,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT
1601,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
1602,O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO,O THAT THE NA HELP JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
1603,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF F WOULD C WOULD MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF WOULD COME WHEN MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT I COULLD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF
1604,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
1605,AND THE ROCK THE S STEEL ROCK,IN THE ROCK THE STEEL ROCK
1606,YES,YES
1607,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE N NET THE NAIL DID,WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE NET THE NAIL DID
1608,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM STAY LIKE THA,WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNETS THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM TOSTAY LIKE THT
1609,YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THEY'LL DEPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,YES BECAUSE CARBORD A THICK CARBORD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARBORD BUT THICK CARD BORD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE THING PENDING APON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS
1610,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME LA SOME OF THE IRON VIRLINES STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T
1611,THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET,HE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
1612,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
1613,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE TH THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T G ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARES THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THIC CARBBORD SO THEY COULDN'T ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
1614,WE HAVE PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK S STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ONTO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT,WE HAVE PUT THEM AND BOXES AND THEN TOOK STEEL SHAPINGS AND A COMPASSED TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICK TO STOCK TAPED ON TO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT
1615,GOOD,GOOD
1616,YEAH SOMETIMES,YEAH SOMETIMES
1617,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND M ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY BY LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW,THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND IT M ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY CLOE LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW
1618,TTRACTED EACH OTHER,NDUCTED EACH OTHER
1619,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNETS RUBBED ON TH THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNE IT MAKES IT M A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNET WRUBED ON THE THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY WRAP TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNET IT MAKES IT A BIT MAGNETIZED SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
1620,IT IT STUCK ON ONTO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK T AS WELL,IT IT STUCK UM ON TO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK TO AS WELL
1621,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE MADE THEM WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH I AND WHAT WOULDN'T
1622,THEY'RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER,THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
1623,THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER,THEY EATTRACT AT EACH OTHER
1624,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS A MAGNET,NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT SONG'S A MAGNET
1625,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STAY LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD,WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STIL LIKE THA N YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOOD
1626,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN,IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
1627,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS SO FIND AND YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN,IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS WHT WL YOU COULD FIND IND YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN
1628,MAGNET DID,MAGNET DID
1629,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME,WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT  IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
1630,THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK,THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CAR BORD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK
1631,THE UM THE WHAT WAS IT CALLED THE UM,THE UM THE THE UM
1632,THE BATTERY UM TELLS THEM THE THE M,THE BATTERY UM TELLS THEM THE THEM
1633,THEY HAVE TO TOUCH IT OR ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY TOUCHING IT BUT IT HAS TO BE PRETTY NEAR OF IT NEAR IT REALLY BY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY BUT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING IT LITTLE BIT,THEY HAVE TO TOUCH IT OR ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY TOUCHING IT BUT IT IT HAS TO BE PRETTY NEAR T IT NEAR IT REALLY CLOBYE  DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY BUT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING IT LITLE BIT
1634,THE MOTOR IS GOING FROM ALL OF IT THE UM THE BATTERY HAS THE TWO THE OF THEM THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH HAS THEM ALL CONNECTED AND SINCE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED IT MAKES THE MOTOR GO,THE MOTOR IS GOING FROM ALL OF IT THE UM THE BATTERY HAS THE TWO THE OF THEM THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH HAS THEM ALL CONNECTED AND SINCE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND MAKES THE MOTOR GO
1635,AND THE LIGHT BULB CAN FEEL IT COMING THROUGH SO IT TURNS ON AND IT GOES DOWN THROUGH THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE AND IT GOES BACK AND THEN IT GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY,AND THE LIGHT BULB CAN FEEL IT COMING THROUGH SO IT TURNS ON AND IT GOES DOWN THROUGH THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE AND IT GOES BACK AND THEN THEY GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY

1644,WE TOOK ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP NEXT TO THE BATTERY THAT KEPT IT BY THE BATTERY AND THEN WITH THE OTHER ONE WE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE ONE WITHOUT THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN WE DID IT WITH THE SWITCH WE TOOK IT AND WE GOT THIS PIECE OF WIREISH THING AND WE CONNECTED ONE END OF THE MOTOR'S WIRES TO IT TO THE CLIP AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER ONE AND CONNECTED IT TO A CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND THEN WITH THE WIRE WE CLIPPED IT ON THE OTHER CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND CONNECTED THAT ONE TO THE OTHER,WE TOOK ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP ONECT TO THE BATTERY THAT KEPTED IT BY THE BATTERY AND THEN WITH THE OTHER ONE WE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE ONE WITH OUT THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN WE DID IT WITH THE SWITCH WE TOOK IT AND WE GOT THIS PIECE OF WIRES THINGAND AND WE CONNECTED ONE END  OF THE MOTORS WIRES TO ITH TO THE CLIP AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER ONE AND CONNECTED IT TO A CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND THEN WITH THE WIRE WE CLIPKED IT ON THE OTHER CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND CONNECTED THAT ONE TO THE OTHER
1645,IS HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING,IS HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING
1646,LITTLE THINGS I FORGOT THE NAME OF THEM GO THROUGH THE WIRE IN THROUGH THEM LIKE DON'T GO THROUGH THEM BUT KINDA GO AGAINST AND KINDA GO THROUGH IT FEELS KINDA LIKE,LITTLE THINGS I F GOT THE NAME THEM GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND THROUGH THEM LIKE IT DON'T GO THROUGH THEM BUT KIND OF GO AGAINST AND KIND OF GO THROUGH FEELS KIND OF LIKE
1647,WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY,WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
1648,TODAY WE UM TOOK A MOTOR AND A BATTERY AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO THEN WE TOOK THE MOTOR AND A BATTERY WITH THE SWITCH AND TRIED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY,TODAY WE U TOOK A MOTOR AND A BATTERY AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO THEN WE TOOK THE MOTOR AND A BATTERY WITH THE SWITCH AND TRIED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY
1649,THESE LITTLE MICROSCOPIC UM THING MICROSCOPIC UM,THESE LITTLE MICEROS SKOPCUM MICERAS SKOPBECUM
1650,THE BATTERY IS GIVING THE WI GIVING SOME TO TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON THE BATTERY'S PUTTING THE S UH IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE WIRES WHICH THAT A THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH HAS IS THERE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS THERE AND THE SWITCH WHEN IT GOES OVER THERE IT HITS THAT IT MAKES THE BATTERY KNOW AND THEN IT TELLS THE MOTOR TO GO ON,THE BATTERY IS GIVING THTHE W GIVING SOME TO TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON THE BATTERY'S PUTTING THE IT IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE WIRES WHICH THAT THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH HAS IS THERE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS THERE AND THE SWITCH WHEN IT GOES OVER THERE IT HITS THAT IT MAKES THE BATTERY NOW AND THEN IT TELLS THE MOTOR TO GO ON
1651,THE UM MOTOR DOESN'T REALLY UM IT GOES THE A DIFFERENT WAY SO SINCE THE BATTERY IS FLIPPED,THE UM MOTOR DOESN'T REALLY UM IT GOES THE A DIFFERENT WAY SO SENDSE THE BATTERY IS FLOPED
1652,THE BATTERY IS THERE AND THE WIRE SINCE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS IS GOING THROUGH IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB,THE BATTERY IS THERE AND THE WIRES SINCE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS IT IS GOING THROUGH IT IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB
1653,THAT IS THE SWITCH TURNING THE MOTOR ON BY IT'S GOING BY THAT THAT'S HITTING IT TO MAKE THE WIRE KNOW THAT'S THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE MOTOR,THAT IS THE SWITCH TURNING THE MOTOR ON BY IT'S GOING BY THAT THES HITTING IT TO MAKE THE WIRE NO LIT'S THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE MOTOR

1656,IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THEY WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING,IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY IT WOLD'T PICK UP ANY YOU KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
1657,WE HAD HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE CHARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY,WE HAD HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE TRARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE START AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY
1658,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT,MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT
1659,IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SWIT SWITCH THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND TO MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT THERE IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AGAIN,IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SINE ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SSWITCH THEN FLOWING UP TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND HOW MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT IT IS AT THAT POINT AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AN
1660,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MINUS SIGN WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY A LITTLE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND TO PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRY TO PICK THEM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MIUS SIDE HOW WE HAD IT WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY N THE BATTERY WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING AN THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRIED TO PICK HEM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAPE IM OFF INSTEAD
1661,YES,YES
1662,THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND INSTEAD TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE,THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND INSTEAD TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICK ING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE
1663,YES,YES
1664,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL IS IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS A MAGNET WE WOULDN'T USE WE'LL NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOMETHI A SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PICK,THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOUWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL IS  IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND THE METAL THING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS MAG WE WOULDN'T USE WE'D NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS ITH THAT CONNECTS IT TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK C THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOME A SOURCE IF SOMETHING TO PICK UP
1665,IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS THEN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP,IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAPP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU 'WILL WRAP IT AROUND LESS THAN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP
1666,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND OUR HOU IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEM UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT SO WE DON'T TO TO PUT THEM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD,THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US SO WE DON'HAT TO GRAP M OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCH IS AROUND OR IN OUR HOUSES AND  THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK I'M UP AND TURN IT OFF WITHOUT YEAH  SO WE DON'T TO TO PUT THIM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAP M OFF IN STED
1667,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS GREAT,YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS RIGHT
1668,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY,IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
1669,BECAUSE OF MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING MORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING IT A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE,BECAUSE THE MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING A MORE OF IT'S FLOWING THROUGH IT AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING IT'S A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE IN TO THE BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE
1670,WELL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO AS A MAGNET SO UM WE THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS,WELL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIME THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO O AS A MAGNET SO W THE MORE TIME WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS
1671,IT IS THE ELEC TRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK,IT IS THE ECELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE HOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
1672,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STONGER,MORE WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STRONGER
1673,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET,WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
1674,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET,IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACT LIKE  NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
1675,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND IT HOW IT'S IT NEEDS TO GET AROUND THOSE WIRES,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH IT HOW IT MUST BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE BATTERY AND COME OUT OF THE BATTERY AND IT HOW IT'S PU IN IT NEEDS TO GET AROUND THOSE WIRES
1676,I SEE THAT UHM THE WASHERS JUST GOT PICKED UP,I SEE THAT ON THE WASHERS STOPP PICKED UP
1677,BECAUSE ENERGY MUST BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND ENERGY KIND OF I DON'T KNOW,BECAUSE ENERGY MUST BE FIF THROUGH AND ENERGY TRATS I DON'T KNOW
1678,THAT IT LOOKS LIKE UHM THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY COOL AND UHM THERE'S ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT GOES OUT,IT'S THAT AIT LITLE SCIKE  THE ENERGY JUST KEEPS ON GOING THROUGH THE WIRE IT KIND OF IT LOOKS FRELLY COOL AND THERE'S ONE PART WHERE IT GOES IN AND OF COURS THERE'S INY OTHER PART THAT GOES OUT
1679,UHM UHM YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOU'RE ABLE ACTUALLY MAKE A MAGNET TO TURN IT ON AND OFF,YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENERGY AND YOU RE IT WILLE TACHALLY MAKE A MAGNET WHERE IT WLD TO FI IT ON AND OFTH
1680,THE RIVET MUST BE STEEL,A RIVEHET MUST BE STILL
1681,GOOD HOW ARE YOU,GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
1682,UHM THAT IT PICKED UP THE UHM WHAT UHM,ONM THAT IT PICKEDD UP THE UM THE WAYWA UM
1683,IS ABLE TO TURN ON THE MAGNET ON AND OFF SO IF YOU TURN IT OFF THERE UHM UHM THE WASHERS WOULD FALL OFF IF YOU KEEP IT ON THE WASHERS WILL NOT FALL OFF,BECAUSEN ABL TO TURN ON THE MAGAT ON AND OFF SO IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEY THE RIVE UM THE WASHERS WOULD FALL OFF IF YOU CNDSPIT ON THE WASHERS WILL NOT FMOLLLOFF
1684,YOU DO NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU WRAP UP ALL THE WIRES UHM GOOD BECAUSE I DID TRY DOING THAT BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK,YOU DO NEED TO MAE TR WIGHT WRAP UP ALL THE WIRES UM GOOD BSCIC TRY DOING THAT BUT WHEN IT WORKS

2102,WELL YOU SEE THE WOOD DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL AND ANY OTHER MAGNET SO SUPER CONDUCTORS SO WILL NOT STICK,WELL YOU SEE THE WOOD DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON NOR STEEL IN T OR OTHER MAGNETS OR SUPVE SUPER CONDUCTORS SO IT WILL NOT STICK
2103,THEY ONLY STICK TO METALLIC ITEMS SUCH AS METALS STEEL AND IRON BUT NOT ALUMINIUM OR OTHER STUFF THEY ONLY STICK TO,THEY ONLY STICK TO MAPALE ITEMS SUCH AS METAL STEEL AND E IRON BUT NOT ALUMINUM OR OTHER STUFF THEY ONLY STICK TO UM
2104,WOOD TIN WELL PAPER CABINET MAYBE AND PLASTIC,WOOD TENWELL PAPER CABINET MAYBE AND PLASTIC
2105,WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER MAGNET OR ANY IRON OR STEEL AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A SUPER CONDUCTOR BUT THE NAIL DOES HAVE IRON AND STEEL I SAID THAT A LOT,WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER MAGNETS OR OR ANY IRON OR STEEL AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A SUPER CONDUCTOR BUT THE NAIL DOES'T HAVE IRON STEEL I SAID THAT AL LOT
2106,STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPER CONDUCTORS,STEEL IN IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPER CONDUCTORS
2107,BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR IS IRON AND STEEL AND THEY LIKE TO STICK TO METAL AND STEEL,BECAUSE THE REFRGERATOR IS A IRON AND TEEL AND THEY LIKE TO STICK TO METALLUMSTEEL
2108,THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON MAKING IT STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT THE WOOD IS NOT SO YEAH,THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AN IRON MAKING IT STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT THE WOOD IS NOT SO YEAH
2109,I'M SORRY AND BUSY YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT,UM SORRY AND BISY AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THE DAY
2110,THEY HAVE IRON,THEY HAVE IRON
2111,BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON,CAUSE  THE NAIL 'S MADE OUT OF STEEL INIRON
2112,I DON'T KNOW,UI DON'T KNO
2113,I THINK THE OBJECTS THAT THAT'S THAT HAVE BEEN STICKING HAVE THE METALLIC ITEMS THAT MAKES IT STICK TO THE MAGNET,I THINK THE OBJECTS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN STICKING HAVE THE MATALIC ITEMS THAT MAKES ITS STICK TO THE MAGNET

2136,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
2137,IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE THE THUNDER YEAH YEAH EXACTLY THUNDER HA LIKE THAT LIKE YEAH,IT'S BECAUSE IT IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED IN STUFF LIKE NDO OR YEAH YEACXACTLY KIND OR HOH I REED LIKE YEAH
2138,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF,I THINK THAT THE BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
2139,I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT,I NOTICED THAT IS IT THAT IT IS A CIRCUIT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
2140,THEY ARE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND BUT IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED FOR ME AND <unk>,AY'RE COMPARED M BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND FITS AN OF MORE CONMPLECATED FORMNTSTUFF
2141,NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD,NOTICE THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RED
2142,IT IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND THE STUFF,HE IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THEY BOATH BULBS WITH OR ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND STUFF
2143,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
2144,WHAT,WHAT
2145,DON'T,DON'T
2146,THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2147,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE AMOUNT IT'S GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS,THIS FORMATIONI'S ALL ABOUT TH EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE PATTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAVE THEN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE BUT THE MOUNT IS GOOD AND ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S AWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANT
2148,GOOD,GOOD
2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,WELL H SOIL THAT DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE HOW MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T WITH THE WATER GO DOWN IT GE LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEWILL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TO
2151,WE BEEN,TE WE WRE DOING
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WARK GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POURE WATER UM GRAVEL
2153,I SEE WATER IN SOIL,I SEE WATER AND SOIL
2154,YEAH,YEAH
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DERTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SAL THE SOIL KEEPS OUT ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THA HA TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRINK DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP TH THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN FLI SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBED MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLI LITERS AND AND BUT IT WON'T LET YOU ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FOURTY WHICH IS DIPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IS COSED TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT
2158,GOT WET,IT
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,PUTTY MORE INFERMATION IS AND PARTSS BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL SO BCAUSE THE POTTING H SO YOUWLTAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN  IT JUST ALECT TO GO DOWN TO THE CUP
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WE GRAPH GRAPHLE AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,YEAHI JUST LIKE THAT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I OBSERBED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE PATTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT START AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEEL KILLES THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,THE THING THAT AT ORGANISED IS WHEN YOU USED PUT POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR IT'S PLANT TO SAVE IT AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY D TA
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER CALSTILL GO AWAY AN BECAUSE THE WATER JUST FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER UM THE SOIL YOU CAT GOLE THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE AN OUH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JES GOES DOWN BECAUSE IT'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATERS DIRTY AND IT KEEPS HOLE A LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER AND SOIL
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER
2168,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,WHEN I USED TABLES I I USED POTTING SOIL AND THEN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE PATTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE PATNM SOIL IS DIRT SO IT STUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH H WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUST LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WILL DIE
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,BECAUSE UM SOMETIMES THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AUM ABSORBING THE WATER T GROW S PLANTS TO GIVE THIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESNT BECAUSE IT ABSORBS AL READY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNTS OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT AN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT
2171,BYE,BYE
2172,YEP YEP,YEP YEP
2173,WELL THE GRA THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOIL'S WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT U ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS IT ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUGH,WELL THE GRAPH THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOILS WATER DOESE IT GOE DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEP IN IT ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S THOLDS THAT IF ITTHROUG
2174,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GE AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'D BE GREAT,WELL YOU CAN GO ING YOUR CAPETER  WELL YOU CAN'T GO INY COMPEAUT YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDTER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GOING YOU ROOM AND THEN UM AND THEN GO GET WATER AND YOU S BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN YOUSED THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU COULD SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GO S MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THATWLL BE GRAT
2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER DRAINS WIT UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE COLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF A WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT
2176,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESN'T IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T UM WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON 'EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,WHEN YOU POUR IT ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOES IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN IN THE ROCKS ALL THE ROCKS CAN' UM YOU POUR WATER ON TEM THE IT GOES MIXS MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLD
2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THER'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERME BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AN THE I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER ON THE GRAVEL THAT THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL
2178,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT A THING DIRTY AND WOULDTR SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEEN
2179,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER,YEAH IT JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IT'S MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER
2180,UHM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK,UM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK
2181,UHM WELL UHM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE,UM WELL UM WHEN LIGHT IS SINING LIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT LIGHT
2182,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE,WHEN THELIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAIN ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OTHEY OTHER COLORS SHINE THERE SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE
2183,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BALL,IT DOESN'T STO RED OVER THE BLUE BALL
2184,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALLB IS WHIHT AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE
2185,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT,WELL I NOTICED THAT THERE IS THEM WHITE LIGHT
2186,GOOD,GOOD
2187,SO WHEN THE WHITE UHM LIGHT SHINING ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,SO WHEN THE WHIT LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2188,WELL UHM THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL BECAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK IT JUST LOOKS BLACK,WELL THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES TO THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FORH THE BLUE BALL CAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK LOOK BLA
2189,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTED N THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALLS NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE
2190,BECAUSE THE GREEN LIGHT IS GREEN,CUS THE GREEN MINE IS A GRE
2191,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY UHM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL THEY ARE YELLOW,THE LIGHT RAYS THATARE HITTING THE BALL HARE WHIT AND WHEN THEY ARE ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL IN THEI'RE YELLOW
2192,RED,RED
2193,UHM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,UM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2194,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL
2195,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT AROUND,NLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE A W ROUT
2196,WELL SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB,WELL SHOWED FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A A LIGHT BULB
2197,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UHM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UHM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT  RED AND WHEN THE CAR OMES THROW UM IT'S JUST LOOK RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK
2198,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT
2199,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THAT COLOR TOO,YOU HAD THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERD PAPER WOULD THE OTHER OBJECTS WHICH URN THE COLOR TOO
2200,SO WHEN WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL UHM THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAME WITH THE BLUE SO ONLY YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BALL AND ONLY BLUE COMES THROUGH FOR THE BLUE BALL BLUE BALL,SO WHEN THE WHIT LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BUL MORE THE BLOA BALL M THE OTHER COLO OF THE RAIN BO CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW WIT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAY WITH THE BLOU SO THE YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BELL AND OENLY BE COME PLETE ING THE BUBE A MOVE OFF
2201,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UHM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT AS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UH MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHIGHTE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT WITH THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
2202,COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH,THE COLOR WILL SHINE THROUGH
2203,IT'S TURNING BLACK,IT'S TURNING BLACK
2204,SO UHM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT,SO UHM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BOLS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBL EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT

2758,MMM HMM OKAY,MM HMM I
2759,IT WOULD GO IN HERE AND IT WOULD MAKE THAT ONE LIGHT UP,IT WILD GO IN HERE AND IT WOULD MAKE THAT ONE LIGHTU
2760,CAN'T GO OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES,CAN'T GO OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
2761,PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AND OFF SWITCH,PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AND OFF SWITCH
2762,UH WHAT WE DID WAS WE TRIED THAT ONLY THERE WAS A BATTERY HERE AND A BATTERY THERE BUT WHAT I WAS THEN THINKING WAS WELL THEN WHY NOT MAKE THE BATTERIES CONNECT CAUSE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE N TWO MORE WIRES AND CONNECT THE BATTERIES SO THAT IT WOULD FIT AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE OFF TWO ENERGY SOURCES BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTERIES CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCES WILL MIX AND IT WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER,UH WHAT WE DID WAS WE TRIED THAT ONLY THEREAS A BATTERY HERE AND A BATTERY THERE BUT WHAIT I WAS THEN THINKING WAS WELL THEN WY NOT MAKE THE BATTERIES CONNECT CAUSE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE OULD TAKE AN TWO MORE WIRES AN' CONNECT THEE BATTERIES SO THAT IT WOULD FIT AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE OFF TWO ENERGY SOURCES BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTERIES CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCES WILL MIX AND IT'LL MAKE IT BRIGHTER
2763,BYE I WANNA SEE NO I HAVEN'T,BUI I WANT TO SEE NO I HAVEN'
2764,YES MMM HMM,YES MM HMM
2765,BECAUSE IT GOES IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT MMM HMM YES THEY ARE,BECAUSE IT GOES IN TA CIRCLE LIKE TIMES MM HM  YES THE ATHER
2766,DEPENDING ON UM HOW MANY LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES YOU USE LIGHT BULBS PRETTY MUCH CAUSE IF THERE'S FOUR THEN THERE WOULD BE FOUR CIRCUITS,DEPENDING OUN UM HOW MANY LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES YUSE LIGHT BULBS PRETTY MUCH CAUSE IT THERE'S FOURE THAN THERE BEFOURE CIRCUITS
2767,THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU GO AGAIN HERE'S THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT'LL GO DOWN PAR WELL,THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU GO AGAIN YHE'RE'S A LIGHT BULB THEN N GO DOWN WELL
2768,WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VARY FROM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO A REGULAR CIRCUIT,WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VERY FORM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO A REGULAR CI
2769,THEY DON'T WORK,THEY DON'T WORK
2770,THE OTHER WAY,THE OTHER WAY
2771,YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN,YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHING WULD HAPPEN
