228,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN THTWO OCEONS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER ABIYE
229,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING PLAY WITH THE WATER
230,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER
231,WELL UM WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE,WELL I WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE
232,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
233,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCE
234,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,YOU ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET
235,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU'RE WANTTON NA MAKE YOUR ELECTROMAGNEESTROMETI IDE MORE BATTERIES FACING POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
236,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THE MORE LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
237,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BATI SNA BATA MELOGRAPH IS NUMBERS
238,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,M IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A VASING WATER AND I CASING WATE
239,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING THROUGH AND A LIGHT BULB  MUSHIDING THE R
240,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS RIGHT,IT'SDIFFERENT BECAUSE IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE THE ELECTRICITY WILL RUN OUT AND THEY'SE CERTAIN TKINDS OF DIFFERENT BULL THAT AN INSIDE IT SHINES O BIGHT
241,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
242,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
243,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BEIT WORK THE LIGHT WILL ITBE
244,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED  SUPPOSED TO BE RED
245,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FTWO PERSON
246,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIGHT EEP ON BASHING OFF OF OBJECT BOTH THE COLOR BLUE
247,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF ULIGHT GREEN AND U ORANGE BALL BCAUSE YOU CAN ONLY USE THE LIGHT
248,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,OONE SPACER TIK NI AD E WASHERS TE BREAK IT
249,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS UNDER THE PAPER AS OF TEPAPER CLIP IS ON TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND
250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN I JUST ENTERED WHEN THE WASHEDIT IT BROKE ETS ALL BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE AT THE SPACES MADE TO FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSERVE HAPPENING IS LIKE GENINTEM PRESSING THE WASHERS GOING
253,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,ELWHAT IT SHOWS IT MAKES THE  MAGNET MAKES THE AMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
254,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE GOOD TO SEE  THE MAGNETTISM OF THE PARMATUALLY IS FORCE TONOUG
255,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT CUL GO UP TO THE IT BROKE IT FALL
256,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNETWILL MAKES O THROUGH AND IT JUST REALLY REALLY N LIKE IT DON'T WIT THOSE PCEPRES
257,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,IT IS UP THAT THAT RI THT GN THINGJUST
258,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT  ANY TEM  MAGNETS ON IT IT REACTS LIKE
259,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHAT IS ANIS THE OGTIR IS ATERTE ICLP AN THA
260,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE JUST SEE THE SAMETHING YOU USUALY ME LAST NIGHT
261,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,MORE ARE YOU SPECIPSUNG ME O MOVE BECAUSE ALL I SEE YOUS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THE NAIL ON THE PAPER CLIP
262,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,MOTAL SOPANY IS IT STICKING TO THE NAIL AND IT CONNECTIN TO APER ANDIT
263,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,ONCE O THE MAGNET DROPED ITW ANOTHER TABLE AND THEN THE MAGNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET S CONNECTING IT AND HOLDING T
264,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,MOTOR IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE AN CSTILL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNET FORCE IS SO LIKE IT SO STRONG
265,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS WE FROM THE NAIL AND THOUG THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETIS
266,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS TA METAL AND A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
267,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD MPAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
268,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT IS ROWING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM
269,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETPTISM FORCES OFF AND BECAUSE IT E MAGNET IS MAKING IT J
270,THE FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER AN OTOR MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
271,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY TO
272,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOTS OF EELECTRICITY GOING AROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND LIKE THE LIGHT BULB
273,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT U
274,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHEN IT WHATEVER SID YOU JUST SWITCH IT TO IS STILL WORKS THE SAME LIN
275,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOESN'T A CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
276,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WHAT WEN WIRE IS HITTING THROUGH THE PIECE OF WIRE ONE IS HETDING TO THE BASE WIRE
277,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,O WHAT I NOTICED AOUT THE SET UP IS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH BULD WATRS INTO THE LIGHT BUL
278,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A CIRCUIT GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE LEKE IT WITH THE ELECTRICITY
279,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,ITHE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
280,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS
281,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUITS IN HOW IT'S AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
282,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,IT ACTS TO MAGNETI COECCUDON PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRST
283,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE UARER IS CLOSED
284,UM THE ROLE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SO,AL OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS
285,SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL,T SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TWO AND WE WERBOBIG THE MARO AND  IT SHOWS IT ON THE WOOL
286,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION,BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF OF THE MARE WHICH GIVES HIM SO HE CAN'T SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
287,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT UM REFLECTIONS THERE ARE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE IT SHINE BRIGHTER,BY HOW THE DIFFERENT U REFLECTIONS THER ARE WTHEY WERE THEY'RE ABLB TO SE THIS N BRIGHTER
288,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND IT'S SETTING TO THE STAR,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS DO AND THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF DIFFERENT MIRRORS AND ATS SETTING TO THE START
289,THE GUY HE FLICK THE SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHT,THE GUY HE FLICKED A SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
290,LIKE A MIRROR CAUSE SOMETIMES REFLECT IT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,LIKE A MIRRORSOMETYPES REFLECTING GO TO THE CENTER OSOMETHING LIKE THAT
291,WHAT I KNOW IS UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULB LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IT ONE,WATER I KNOW IS CERTAIN LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUSIS ONE SPOK
292,IF ITS AND IN CONNECTS IF THIS HE DOES IN AND THEN A DOES EITHER,IF IT'S N S IT CONNECTS IF IT'S SNUS IT DOESN'T AND IF IT'S  IT DOESN'T EITHER
293,I THINK WHAT IS ALL ABOUT IS SHE TRYING THE FINAL WAY I GUESS NORTH OR SOUTH,I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUASRANTS AND THE EARTH
294,WHAT YOU THING MORE THAN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB WENT OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECT,WAT CAN WITH THE LIPPERS PICTURE IT TE WELL IN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHT BULB BRINKS OUT AND THE ONE STILL CONNECTTHE WAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE OTHER
295,BEESLY WIRE THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDLE THING,LOG IS NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE METAL THING
296,LAST YEARLY MEANS THAT ELECTRICITY WHAT GO OTHER ONE IS ELECTRICITY THAT EASY,AIT MEANS THA TO MAKE ELECTRICITY MINE THROUGH THE OTHER ONE  HN ELECTRICITY THAT EAT
297,THE WIRE THE ELECTRICITY THOSE THAT'S GOING IS BECAUSE AN LIGHT BULB OF OUT,THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRICITY DO FLOWS STOPS GOING IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB BULB BURNS OUT
298,WHAT I THINK MORE HAPPENS IS ELECTRICITY GOES STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND LIGHT BULB IS STOP STOP LIGHTING UP,WHAT I THINK WWITLL HAPPEN IS ITELECTRICITY WILL WL STOP FLOWING THROUGH AND THE LIGHT BULB I STOP  STOP LIGHTING UP
299,HAPPENS IS AND THE FILM WAS GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND WHAT IS ACTION,WRAPPINS IS WAP REPEAT AND THE FILAMENT WILL GO DOWNDOWNDOWNDOWN AND PLUT THE INTERUT
300,IT MAY BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE A CONNECT INTO LINE THE,IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT VENIX IT'LL LIGHT UP  WOLLN'T BREAK THAT
301,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THAT IS NO LIKE I MEAN,WHY DO I THINK THIS IS THIS BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN ELECTED TO TR
302,HE REASON LIKE THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEM FINAL RECHARGE IN THE WIRE LIKE ITS,THE REASON WHY I THINK THAT IS BARNEY IT'S BECAUSE TUM IS FINALLY TTACKING THE WIRE LIKE IT SUPPOSED TO B
303,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THERE REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH DIFFERENT NEW ONE,WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THEY REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH THE DIFFERENT NEW ONE
304,I WILL CHECKS BY LIGHT BULBS I GUESS TWO OR ONE LIGHT BULB AND MORE LIGHTUP WORK,ATIS LIVE LIGHT BULBS AND I GUESS TO  O LIGHT BULB ANDU LIGHT UP O THAT'S
305,WHAT WE NOT DIFFERENCED BUT LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY HE WAS SWITCH SIDE,WAT WE HALD THAT THE FI CAN ELECTRICIT NOT GOING  LIGHT THEOTTHE LIGHT BULBS LI DEFI THE SWITCH IS
306,WHAT HAPPENING THIS ENERGY IS JUST WASTING ON INTO THE AIR BECAUSE THOSE NOW ELECTRICITY INTO,WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ENERGY IS JUST PACING ELINGTO THER BECAUSE TERAS NOBERNG THE ELECTRICITY INTOXRE
307,CIRCUIT LIGHT IS THE SERIES AND IT ADD SUCH ONE WIRE CONNECTED,THECIRCUITS IN THE CIRCUIELL LIGHT S A SERIES IF IT ITAT LEAST HAVE TO BE ONE WIRE CONNECTED
308,WHAT INTO THE ELECTRICITY WENT TO THE ONE OF THE CIRCUIT WENT TO THE ITS STOPPED WORKING,WEINTI THE ELECTRICITY BURNS OUT ONE OF THE CIRCUITS AND WHEN IT BURNS IT OUT UMIT STOPPED WORKING
309,HAVE BEEN WHEN I NOTICE ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB WILL WORK AND OTHER ONE HAS IS,HAPPENS THAT I NOTICE THAT THE BOOK ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB O WORK  THE OTHER ONE THAT IS ANTET TE
310,BUT I NOTICE ONE LIGHT BULB THIS LIGHTING UP THIS IT IS RIGHT,WHAT I KNOW WHAT IC SEENS T LIKE ONE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP NDTHE OTHER C BURNT OUT AND IT'S NOT BORKING AT ALL
311,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT,THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THEREIS NO MAGNET IN IT
312,AND NOTE FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NOT DISSOLVE,IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
313,THINGS THAT STICK MAGNET OR EITHER METAL AND ONCE USUALLY PACKED PLASTIC,THE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET ARE EITHER METAL AND THE ONES ARE EASIALLY PPLASTIC OR WID
314,THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK,THE PAPER FASTENER STAYS ON AND THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK
315,IT GOES THROUGH HOW THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONE GOES BACK INTO IT,IT GOES THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THE NEGATIVE ONES GOES BACK INTO IT
316,THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS
317,WHAT THE HAVE THEY COMPARED IS SETUP DIFFERENTLY STILL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY,ONE HOW THEY COMPARE IS THEY'RE SET UP DIFFERENT WAYS BUT STEEL LIGHT UP THE SAME WAY
318,I THINK I GUESS THE WHY I AM THE MADE CHOICES,I THINK I GUESS THE BOTTOM AN TEA ADDED CHOICES BUT
319,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO  THEN ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GOES STOP GO BUT IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT GOWS AGROUND AND MACING RADS AND BACK TO T
320,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOUR AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT WELL THERE IS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE ONE
321,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,WHAT I NOTICED THAT THE PATHWAY IS THE ENERGY IS TO COMMOR DIFFERENT CONNECTION
322,WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,W WHIT'S BEST ONE NOW I GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THERE'S NOT WASTE AN ENERGY
323,THE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THE CONNECTED RIGHT,THE FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP BECAUSE THE WAY IT ITS GOING ECAUSE IT'S CONNECTED THE RIGHT
324,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,BUT I NOTICED THAT'S ENERGY LOIK GOING AND THE BATTERY THAT'S GOING INTO THE BATTERY
325,IF THE KIND OF CIRCUITS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS,THE KINDS OF CIRCUITS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IS PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
326,THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS I THEY LIGHTS UP IT BURNS OUT AND YOU HAVE TO REPLEX WITH ANOTHER ONE
327,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE MORE
328,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE M PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUIT
329,OH SO IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND,OH SO IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH OF A BASE AND UP THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AND
330,UM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO,UM IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER SO
331,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP,UM THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE WHAT TAKES THE ELECTRICITY AND WARMS THE FILAMENTS UP
332,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WILL FLOW THROUGH,WELL THE WIRE IS WHAT YOU NEED MOOSE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTRICITY WIL FLOW THROUGH
333,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE,YOU HAVE TO CONNECT A WIRE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN HICK IT UP TO THE BASE
334,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH IS IT A CIRCUIT,UM I FORGOT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED BUT IT KEEPS LIKE GOING THROUGH THE LITTLE CIRCUITS
335,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT,YEAH HOW TO LIKE MAKE IT WORK AND STUFF YES WE DID THAT
336,IT MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,MATTERS HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS METUCS HO STRONG THE MAGNET IS
337,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS,UM WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FORCE OF MAGNETS AND HOW THEY CAN CONNECT FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FIELDS
338,BECAUSE THE SOUTHS CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE THEY WOULD PUSH AWAY,BECAUSE THE SOUTH CAN'T BE TOGETHER WITH THE NORTH BECAUSE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY
339,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSO A TEMPORARY MAGNET,WELL MAGNETISM AND IT'S ALSO UM IT'S A ALSOT O A TEMPORARY MAGNET
340,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELEC IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SCREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,AND THERE'S THE BASE IT'S WHAT THE ELECT IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU CREW ON WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
341,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
342,THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPERCLIP MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK,THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPER CLIP MAKING THE PAPER CIP STICK
343,WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES 'EM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES,WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSSING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES THEM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES
344,WELL BECAUSE THE DIS THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY THINK,WELL BECAUSE THE DISTHE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T REALLY GO AS FAR AS YOU ACTUALLY BHINK
345,ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON,A ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
346,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE,THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
347,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH ABOUT MAGNETISM,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH LIKE MAGNETISM
348,THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH,THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH
349,WHEN IT'S ON IT'S OFF AND WHEN IT'S OFF IT'S ON,WELL PART OF IT'S WRONG IT DOESN'T
350,IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OTHER CIRCUITS USUALLY HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT WITHOUT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM,IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OTHER CIRCUITS USUALLY HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT WITHOUT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM
351,IT THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE,IT THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO A POSITIVE
