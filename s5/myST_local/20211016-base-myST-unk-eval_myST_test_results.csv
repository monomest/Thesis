1,OKAY,OKAY
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS  THAT MUCH THIS YEARE
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THEYRE WERED JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH
4,YEAH,YEAH
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANNO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID  I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S SAW IF THAT WOULD MAKE AT DIFFERENTES I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YEAH A LITTLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO I DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HOURISZONTO LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEACHER AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIGG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE TIME IT WAS UM LENGTH AN THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER ND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIRE LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY E JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINSED USS THAT THESHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM UM WEL LIKE EXACTLY WE THE WEIGH OUR DESK WHERE  OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND THEN UM THEN  WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TO YESTERDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY
14,MATH,MATH
15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,OKAY
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO  ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBER STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE  THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED
19,OKAY,OKAY
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM UP STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UH LIKE THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE IS FORCE IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
21,YEAH,YEAH
22,OKAY,OKAY
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SYSTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT  WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP IN A PENNY AND YOU WOULD TACH THE SSTRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I I I DIDN'T TELLHER THIS BUT THE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STHE PENDULUM  SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGERSO
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,OKAY YES WE' DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG HEM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BBUT BE UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO I IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING THE EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,OKAY
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'T'T DONE THAT YET
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISES PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS IT'S
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE W WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHAT HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO I WENT UP INSTEAD UP DOWN
34,UM WE,UM WE
35,WE WERE USING,WE WERE USING
36,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN I WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF
37,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP
38,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WE'RE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSHE DOWN THE UM THE LONCHER THING AND THEN THE UM LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
39,YEAH,YEAH
40,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WELL WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH UM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLYRES AND THEN FLIPPERS
42,YEAH,YEAH
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE C WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOTOR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE
44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WIGHT BUT BUT THEN MISS MOTO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT EFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS OUT COME OUT OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY TO NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WERECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,MM HMM YEAH AND THEN AFT WELL THEN WE TESTED IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE S PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FO OR THREE TO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF TWO
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,WELL  THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFOUR CAUSE WE MADE IT RECORDING SEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LETS SA THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFT TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOURE TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHAT WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON  CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS A RESULT AND YEAH
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WE ALL CAME UP WITH THER VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASSTIN AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHESE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE XIS I IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER TWHERE THEY MEAT AND WE WALKED AND LET SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAPH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STEEL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS IN A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WAI WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,UHTHAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USED A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USED AN ALUMION BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USED LIKE A BEET OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL THAT
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,MM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SENT SIX AS ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT W KEPT GOING OUT NTILL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSED TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVES ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVES TRIED AND YE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY INTO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE
63,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO
64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,THAT WAS FURTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM  IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WORTH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELLER TO POWER F IT THROUGH I GUESS
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULDGET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAD MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REEAL PLANE SO I BET THE HA THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE S THE MORE SPINSE UH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DIDN WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD TSCIENCE AND THEN  AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK TWO WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE JUST JUST GUASSED WHAT NUMBER
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED O HA LIKE TO JUST PULL IT AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AN SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REEAL EXPERIENC WENT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE ENTOF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST ENT TO USS CAUSE IT THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE W TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW HOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P  SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO SP
71,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL W NO  REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN SOAND THAT WOULD BE COOL
72,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETE FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOUR METERS,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETER FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOURT
73,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YEP ACTU LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE JUST IDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A  LIKE MORE ALITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST JUSSIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AN IT PRETTY AMUCH WENT EXACTLY I ON
74,YEAH,YEAH
75,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNUSS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WERE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ONOH YEAH WE'RE SKEEPING FORTY SPINS U WE'RE JUST TRYINGT FORTY SPINS LIKE THIS'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
76,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
77,YEAH,YEAH
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S ALL LIKE REALLY COOLD TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS CAUSE TH WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMON DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO THE C AND THIS WOMON WAS DOING A FERONT HANDSPRING OFF THE I WAS  ASD DOING A VALT AND I DO A LIKE I TAKEDJREMASSTICKS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH
79,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OUH YEAH FOUR METERS
80,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN AS LIKE SO YOU GO AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEEATS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOURE FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY TTESTED IT LIKE ONCE
81,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHARE WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR  IT WAS ONE CHAR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROPP IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PARTE IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO  SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKIDNESS SO MAGH BE THE CHARES WERE CROKIED
82,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
83,OH YOU'RE WELCOME OKAY,UM OKA OKAY
84,HELLO,HELLO
85,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
86,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,OH THE OH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS ASOM
87,YEP,YEP
88,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO HO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING IT AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWAY SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE N ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KI I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTINATED AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM S WEIGH SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINSE SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE EN A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW HY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KIND THIK I THINK THAT WE WERE THIS COUNTING I GUESSD MAYBE

142,AND THEN,AND THEN WAING
143,YEAH,YEAH
144,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE  BOATS WE SARATED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACTUALLY WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN SSUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO UH GRADULATED SAN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
145,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY ITHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ESE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO AFFECT THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STEILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE RUFF WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE RUFF WATERS DEN END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
146,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING
147,YEAH,YEAH
148,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DID THIS WAS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PRUB UP UH WE DIDN'T YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS

155,YEAH,YEAH
156,UM YEAH,UM YEAH
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRYE TO HAVE THE SAME  OUR HOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WW HOW WE COULD GET AND OUT COME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUT COME AND GET FUN FIND I IN A A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES AND LIKE PUT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPED INTO THE BOTTOM WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO
160,YEAH,YEAH
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YEAH IT BECAUSE DO YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WEU WANNA HAVE A EXPLINATION FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU WOULD DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO N  END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OURE THEARE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A UM ALL IN ALL PUM MOT UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES
162,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME S SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LHE  LESS NO LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AN SMALLER BOATS SLOED LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IDT I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MEASHU ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPPS TO THE BOTTOM

1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,MEASUREMENT OF WHET WATER OR WHAT
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASE E MORE OF BATTERIES LIKE LIKE THEY'RE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND NVIS IT PICKED UP THEIR DO WASHERS CAUSE IT ADS TWO BATTERY
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,WAWHEN YOU ICREASE MORE OF THE LIGHTS IT HAS MORE THEREIS A FO
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AN ENERGY IT GETS FORCE
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT I IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINUSED THE LINE TO SEVEN I MA TO TEN ONES I WOUD'T NIT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT I ISSCOVEREDS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT AMORE  WASHERS STICK TO IT
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,TI'S ATTACHED TO THIRTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN IT PUT A HUNDRED WIS IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS U BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UPI PICKED UP OM WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDE UP FIVE MORE
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,THE WIRE'S WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,ININCREASE ONE I DO THAT IPICKS UP TO HELOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WEIGHT  WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED RNS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,WHAT IT RELATES
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'IS NSUPPOSE TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL  IT HAS TO BE THIS CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH TH VS ON D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVESGOES UP TO
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,OU'E ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVT
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT JUBE WOULD DO IF YOU'RE WANTANG TO MAKE YOUR ELECTROMAGTIV ROI ADD MORE BATTERIES FACING POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THERE MORE LINDS YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING IT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING  MORE FORCE INTO IT
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BHUT I S AN BTAGRAPH IS  NUMBERS
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WHAL HAPPENE I E OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BATTERY
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A BASING WATER AND INCASING WATER
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THE ELECTRICITY IE NOW FLOWING THROUGH AND  LIGHT BULB MH
1189,NO,I LOTS
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT IS'  ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE I SIIT TURNS AROUND IT  TO HV E NEGATIVE AND HE POSSITIVE OI T TOUCHING EACH OTHER IN OTER TO  MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
1191,UM IT WILL <unk> IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,ITLL ITLL THE LIGHT BULBS MINBRIGHT AND BREERH TO LIKE TO THE LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS <unk> RIGHT,IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE A BOU JUST HAVE ONE THE ELECTRICITY WILL RUN OUT AND THERE'S CERTAIN INDS OF DIFFERENT BUB THAT AN INSIDE IT SHRTS
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,IT'S GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES US A CIRCUIT IS WH WHEN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CASING WHERE AND THE BASING WIR
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,BOTH WIRES SM THE REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEYW'LL BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU AD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TWO LIGHT BULBS IT'LL LIT BE DELL AND I WONT SHI BRIGHT BUT IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES ITLL  MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS SHINE BRIGHTER
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE THE LIGHT BULB
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONEE A PATHWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING N SCIENCE IS LARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS ITL IT WILL SHIT LOWER AND LOWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT A BATTERY WITHE BATTERYOU PUT THE
1203,OKAY,GREAT
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT <unk>,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT WR THE LIGHT WIL
1205,FINISH,FINISH
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,O CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,NTHEMOE PASI ISOIATTACH TO MAI
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND A WHAT BOTH H WIRES HAS TO BE ON A BASING WIRE AND ON A CASI WIR
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ASO THE LIGHT IS CLARED BECAUSE F FO THE C

1213,COLORS,COLORS I SEE
1214,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED PPOSE TO BE RED
1215,UM CHANGING COLOR,THEY'RE CHANGING COLOR
1216,UM IT WILL TURN DARK,IT WILL TURN DARK
1217,CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS,GT CHANGE THE SAME CURS THE FIM TURN
1218,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,IT'S NO USED TO THEIR COLOR BCAUSE IT SIS GREEN LIME AND IT'S JUST BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
1219,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,IT'S ITHE PRISM IS TOGINIC COLORS
1220,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,HOW THE REFLECTION OF THE COOR A
1221,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FO TO A PERSON
1222,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S IA BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
1223,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIGHT  OP BASHING OFF OF OBJECTS  BOTH THE COLOR BLUE
1224,SEVEN SIX,SEVEN SIX
1225,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,BUT HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THINGSE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIAA TO PURP TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED
1226,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,THE LIGHT IS REFLEX O VOLUABLE
1227,THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR,THE REFLEXTER ISSE TMIXING THE COLOR

1238,SIX COLOR,SIX COLR
1239,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COLORS REFLECTE OFF AN IT HANGES ITS COLOR
1240,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SOLAR DOS AND CIRCUITS A MAET DISM
1241,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BWEN THE CARD IT'S WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNSBLUE
1242,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT
1243,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,ONE SPCE O TEKITS  WASHERS TO BREAK IT
1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,BY IT FORCE
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FORCE WAST THE STRONG ENOUGH
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,WHAT IT DOES IS MIXE THE FIRST WEAKER
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS UNDER THE PAPER NEPAPER CLIP IS OM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUNT
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS S AR NE SIPPOSE TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS O COOU TO CONNECT
1249,THE MAGNET <unk> THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNETTHE MAGNET IS ONSANDLOK STACK AND EN YOU'RE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PPER CLICK HAS O MAGNETISM CONNECT ET TO IT
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN I JUST IDDED WHEN WASHEE IT BROKETSA BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE  THE SPACERS MADE TO FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSERVE HAPPENING IS LIKE TIMPRESSING THE WASHERS GO IN
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT IS VANNUBLY ADD ONE SPACER  BREAKS IS TFALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY D TO STICK ON
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,WATER DOEST MAKES THE MAT MAKES THE AMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAMAGNETS IND AOTHER CUPS I SEE HOW MANY  WASHERS BREAK AL THE MAGNETS FALL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THER GOOD  ST THE MAGNETISM OF THE MAMATALLY IS FORCE ENOUGH
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN HEY GET FURTHER APART  THE FIRS C FORCE CES A WEAKER BECAUSE THERE'S THE OTHER MAGNETS MAGNETTISM AND FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAGNET SA WEAKER
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,THERE'S BRIGTING APART
1260,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,I'M TRING WHEN IT GOT UP TH MAY WASHERS IT CT GO UP TO THE IT BROKE S SAL
1261,MAGNETISM,MAGNETISM
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN IT PRESS SPEACERS WHEN IT ADD THE TUB MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNETS ARE STILL TOUCHING EACH OTHER
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,IT GOES BIGGER THAN EN IT GOES SMALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER WE CAN  WE RE INSTAD OF BEING STRONGER AND USE REALLY THE FORCEI
1265,I NEEDED THREE,I NEEDED THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,NOTICE IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE'S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MAGNET CAUN HOLD THE PAPER
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S SUFERING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE BOING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TICK OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL AN I MEAN THAT KIND OF THE KIND OF MAGNET IN THE THAT'S ALL I HAVE
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THIS V ONCE WHERE IF YOU LIKE WRUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK ITTO A PAPER CLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE O THE FORCE OF IT
1269,<unk> THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,E NAS ATNG LIKE
1270,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL WITH THE THIN ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS TEREA ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY ECAUSE JIT'S STICK IN  L AND THEN ISTAR INTHISS AN TAN IT'S GOING LIKE THAT AND LOK KIND O LIKE MAGNETTIS
1271,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING O IT TE THICK PIECE F PAPER IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK  AN THIN  IT CUT BECAUSE IT SO
1272,BUT THE DIFFERENT <unk> PUSH BACK,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AN WTY PUSHED BACK
1273,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET I MIXEURE THROUGH AND I JUST REALLY REALLY NGIT DOWNE WITH HIS C
1274,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,IT IS P THAT THAT WITH THAT ISN THINGS U
1275,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT HOW I GET THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO IT'S SO WEL STRONG THAT IT COULD GO THROUGH A NAIL AND ORDER IT COULD HOLD A PAPER CLIP
1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,AT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS ITANY TUMT MAGNETS ON IT IT REACTS LIKE
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISNT IT ACTING LIKE A MALIKE WIRE YOU CAUL WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY AND CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH ANDSTILL MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND REACTS LIKE A METAL
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,WHEN IT'S  MAGNET N IT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN ITS NOT IT CAN NOT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
1279,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHARIS ING ANIS HOLDEPECC A
1280,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETTISM
1281,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT'S BECAUSE THEIR MAGNETISM CAN NOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH ANY BETERGRAPH TEPAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S
1282,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE I JUST SEE THE SAME THING YOU ASURING ME LAST NIMET
1283,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,E U SOING MMO BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THE NAIL ON THE PAPERCLIP
1284,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WHATOP IS IT STICK ING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTED TO PAPER
1285,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE
1286,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,ON  THE MAGNET ROP AOTHER TABLE AND THEN HE MAGNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET IS CONNECTING IT AND HOLDI
1287,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,WHAT IIS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE CAUSTIL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNETFORCE IS SO LIKE IT SO STRONG
1288,REPEAT THAT,REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE
1289,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET ISRRE FROM THE NAIL AND TRO THE NAIL SES ITS MAGNETISM
1290,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP<unk>,IT'S GOING ON HERE IS A METLE AND A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
1291,LEARNNG ABOUT MAGNETISM,NOT BRIGHT
1292,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CIP CANNOT REPEL EACH OTHER
1293,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET AND A NAIL AND IT'S FORCE KEEP ON GOING ONTO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
1294,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD <unk> PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
1295,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT IS SHAING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM
1296,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETTISM FORCES OFF AND BECAUSE  MAGNET IS MAKING IT
1297,THE <unk> FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER AND ODOR MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
1298,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET,IT CAN'T BECAUSE THE MAGNEETAM FOR

1302,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS LIGHT ET UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY TO GO
1303,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOT OF E ELECTRICITY GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND ROUND LIKE THE LIGHT BULB
1304,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,I BOTH CONNECT TO THE WISE TUGH THE BASEBULB IT WU REALLY WIT BECAUSE THEPLASTIC IS OLDING
1305,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHTL
1306,BUT I NOTICE IS SOME IMPORTANT THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT,WHAT I NOTICED IS OOM CERTAIN PARTS THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT
1307,THE ELECTRICITY FLOW,ELECTRICITY
1308,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,THE DIRECTION THE FLOW WHEN IT UH THE SWITCH THE D CELL I IT CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND HE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING T OTHER DIRECTION
1309,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING ADD OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1310,WITH THE AT THE SAME WIRE AND YOU,TE BECAUSE IT PUAN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S BOTH AT THE SAME WIRE AND  WON'T O
1311,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHEN T WHATEVER SID YOU JUST SWITCH IT TO IT STILL WORKS THE SAME WA
1312,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOESIN A CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
1313,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WHAT ONE WIREIS HITTING THROUGH THE PIECE OF WIRE ONE IS HITTING TO THE BASE WIRE
1314,WIRES IN IT CIRCUIT CARRY,WIRES IN AS CIRCUIT CARRY
1315,OKAY BUT,OKAY BYE
1316,THE COMPONENT NEED TO BE RIGHT,THE COPONIENT MEEANS TO BE O
1317,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY IF BATTERY GIVING IT IT'S,ELECTRICITY FLOWS B THE BATTERY GIVING ITS ITS ENERGY TO PUSH IRE B
1318,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,WHEN I NOTICED THAT IT DI'T GET THE LIGHT BULB  LIGHT O INSORDER TO LIGHT UP THE  I EENERGY
1319,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,S WHAT I NOTICE AT HAT E SET UP S IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB
1320,WHERE IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE D CELL <unk> WIRES,WHERE THE ELECTRICITY GOS UT OF THE D CELL IS THROUGTTHEWIRES
1321,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW THAT IS GOT,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND NOW BATTERIES GO
1322,ELECTRICITY,THE BLUE DOTS AELECTRICITY
1323,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO MUSE A CIRCUIT GOING AROUND ANDAROUND LKE ITWITH THE ELECTRICITY
1324,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE
1325,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1326,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
1327,WHEN YOU PUT THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING TO,WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING APO
1328,ON THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH,ENERGY IS GOING THROUG
1329,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATTERY HELPS WITH THE WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP LIGHT IT ON AND ITS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
1330,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S IMPORTANT SO THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK COULD GO THROUGH THE FRM BECAUSE IF YOU PUT UT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET TO GET THE MAGNET
1331,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT T CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S  AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
1332,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,TWIRE THE MOVEN THROUGH THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FROM BECAUSE THAT'S WHERTHE ELECTRICITY AN THE ENERGY COCK UP THE
1333,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,IT ACTS TO MAGNET ACONNECACID  PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IOR ST
1334,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY STOWS GOES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORE CICUIC CONNECTI  TOH ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND THIT GOES THROUGH THEPOSITIVE SIDE THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1335,WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT,WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW  OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSIR GUIT AFFECTED AND I NO WEAIHT
1336,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BECAUSE IT IRON OR STEEL TRO THE MAGNETI TO SUBMIT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND ANDN ONTO IT TO MAKE IT ET TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORANCS
1337,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE  IS CLOSE
1338,SMALL,AXID
1339,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WELL THE CIRCUIT OF E SWITCH ATAST SOMETHING  HAS TO BE PLUGED OF A MAGNEGNET FOUR CELL  ELECTRICITY C AVES CALLE THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE
1340,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,WA HAPPEING AT THE RIVER IN THE WIRES S IT HAS TO AT LEAST CONNECT SOME WHAR TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING IT
1341,A RIVET,A RIVET
1342,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT T WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THETHE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUITIT STICKS
1343,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE F THELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH T UM TO THE SWITCH AND THEN T'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE
1344,SCIENCE,SCIENCE
1345,WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS IN,WHAT THAT RELATES H SWITCH S IT AND
1346,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,WHEN  HAS  CLOSED CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE JUST MORE CONNECT WITH THE WASHER T SA AND THE WASHERS SILL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN ITPLE
1347,THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS  MAGNEGTIC FORCE
1348,IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE,IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
1349,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT,CAL YOU REPEAT THAT
1350,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,MAGNE IS WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCEIS I CONNECT TO IT THE WASHERS BECAUSE ITIT HAS NO COMPELL IT TO THE WIRE T
1351,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF THE WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S SWITCHED IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF  THE THING WHEN IT'S PRUSHED OUT WARD NOTHING STICKS IP BUT WHEN ITS FIE IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING

1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL THE OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OUR JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORDING AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THEMIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE  THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AN THE FFIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE T T YOU KNOW ON THE TY TANIC THET THER LIFE BOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAUN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUSE BOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUW SHIP
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL LUNDERING HY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNY IS JUST VESLY WE PWE TRYID T PUT IT IN THEMIDDLE BUT THEN THT GO TO THE SIDE
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T RELLY REMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,IFELLIKE A SUPER STAR IK  ALREADY KNEW THAT KNOWING FINNY
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS LESS OF A CHANSE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASH PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IND THAT CUP AN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
1922,YEAH,YEAH
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,UM WELL OUR CHIMANIES I DON'T PARTICULARLLY KNOW ITS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WITH THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW LIGHT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POURE THAT OUT AND OUR BIN IT'S LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE ANDTHEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIF T USI IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED THEN THREE
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW WE PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MANE THE LIFE BOAT WAS WE TOOCK THE COFFE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIG AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL A UH ONE SIDE IT WAS GOINNTO SINK EVEN FASTER SO
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT
1927,THE HEIGHT,THE HEIGH
1928,MAYBE,MAYBE
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFE C  BOAT CAN HOLD

2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BULL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TOO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAILE MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS AN VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHELL THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND ITIS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A BALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOLLE THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,ITIS CALLED WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,OKAY GOOD
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNICE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORT IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL AND THEYARE UNING PILE INSTEAD OF EN ONE ALL TOGETHER IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S A SOLUTION
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT ITS PURPOSSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING S H IAT TE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND  WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH

2912,I DON'T,I DON'T KNOW
2913,WELL THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIKE BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING EACH OF LIKE BULB TWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK TO LIKE BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK ITS TO THE A POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOESN'T AGAIN,WELL THE ENERGY'S COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING INTO H LIGHT BULB TWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK THROUGH LIGHT BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK INTO THE A POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOES THAT AGAIN
2914,SO MORNIE,SUPMR
2915,I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT,I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT
2916,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDES TOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE WIRES GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKE INTO,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING AE NEGATVE SIDE SIDE AND A WIRE 'S GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKING THE
2917,AH UMM,UHM
2918,IT WOULD BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY WILL,THER WERE TO BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY WON'T
2919,ELECTRICITY BECAUSE ELECTRICITY IS A BLUE DOTS FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE WHILE THROUGH THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHEN THE WIRE ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S THE UNTIL LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHERS,ELECTRICITY CAUSE ELECTRICITY'S  BLUE DOTS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE ONE OF THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE ONE OF THE WIRES ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ITS TURNING TO LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHER
2920,JUST IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS ACTUALLY STAYING LIKE ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS A NOT REALLY AND KEEPS GOING OFF AND YOU HAVE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE BULB AND STUFF LIKE,IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE'S ACTUALLY STAYING LIT ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS LIKE NOT REALLY IT IT KEEPS GOING OFF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LIKE RD LIGHT BULB AND STUFF LIKE
2921,AH WELL RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAD THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE,WERIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAS THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND  POSITIVE
2922,ONE D CELL AND IT'S NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL,ONE D CELL IT NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES  LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL
2923,IT WON'T GLOW,IT WON'T GLOW
2924,THE CIRCUITS ABOUT A FALSE CIRCUIT,A CIRCUIT'S ABOUT A FULL CIRCI
2925,ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVES THOSE CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY WHICH IS CIRCUIT WIRE,ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVES  CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY MAKES A CIRCUIT WORK

2935,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
2936,HI MORNIE,BYE MARNIE
2937,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THERE IS NOTHING THERE IS NO WIRE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE IS ONLY WIRE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THE THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO WIRE'S TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S ONLY WIRES TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE

3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,UM THE SPINNING KIND LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS YOU REALL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GONNA GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE OF PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FOURTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWIST THE PROPELLER BUT UM YOU ALSO NEED SOMETHING WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE BE LIKE CHARES SO THAT THE WIRE WILL IT'S LIKE STAY ON SO HAT THE WIRE QIRE WE CAN TIVE THE WIRE TO THE CHRES AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND A HAVE PAPER UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTO WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON AN JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
3873,HI,HI
3874,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT NO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST  REALLY DEPENDS BUT ANDIT ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S THAT YOU CAN DECIDED BUTHOW HOW FAST YOU WANTIT TO GO HOW FAR IS OR ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YU CAN CHANGE
3875,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY ALITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERSENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNED IT LOOKS HERE THAT THIS GRAPH WOULD'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR T US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERSENT OF TWO METERS BUT HEREID ONLY SAYS TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THTHAT' BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH
3876,W WELL WE HAVE A S WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN IN HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THIS S PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND THE PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE,WELL WE HAVE A WE HAVE THREE STRAWS WELL EN THAT GO  ONE THAT GOES IN THE WIRE AND THEN IM HEREIN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THAT WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STABLED ON EACH SIDE THN WE JUST HAVE THE SU PROPELLER PIECE OF RUBBER BAND ND A PIECE TAT GOES ON THE BAG THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE
3877,UM ONE THING THAT AFFECT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAN AFFECT IT IS THE TYPE OF STRING IN OUR CASE WE'RE DOING FISHING WIRE BUT T IT COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING OR UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS AND THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS,UM ONE THING THAT WOULD AFFECT IT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAFFECTED IS THE TYPE OF STRING AND OUR CUTS WOREDN'T FISHING WIRE BUT YOU COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING TRE UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS IN THE TYPE OF STRING OR ONE TO  THE MAIN THINGS
3878,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ANGLED LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CL IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT,WELL IF IAN GLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE TSANGLE LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST A SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO T'S LIKE CLIME A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M C IF YOU'RE CLIMING ITA HILL YOUE GET MORE EXAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL AND GOING DOWN IT
3879,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS UP WE WANT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE WO A YARD AND A HALF,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOW IN OUR BUT WE WANTNA GET OUR CIP WE WANT BUT THE GO WAS TO MAKE OURS MOVE  A YARD AND A HALF
3880,UM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND,UM WE NEED I WO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO AVE CHANGED IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND
3881,WELL THE THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE ON THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER,WELL THETHE BOTTOM ONE IT'S NOT GONG TO FLY AS FAR BECAUSE IT'S AMPE UP SO IT HAS IT IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE AT THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER
3882,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAKE AIRPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FIGURPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE
3883,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU'LL YOU COULD CHANGE,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WUSE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU YOU COULD CHANGE
3884,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE
3885,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FORTY FIVE,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FORTY FIVE
3886,BYE,
3887,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GO BUMPY AND THEN IT'LL LIKE AFFECT IT AND WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEED A WELL THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOOTH LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR UH STEEP UP OR ELSE IT'LL UM THEN IT'LL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT GOES SMOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GAT ALL BUMPY IN HE LITLE LIKE AFFEC IT AND WELL YOUNYOU NEED TO S S WELLO THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOOTHE LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FARA STEEP UP OR ELTS IT ALL UM AN WEL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH
3888,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED A MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANTTO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TA CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEEN LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO IT'S JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFFERENT IT IS
3889,WHAT,WHAT
3890,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,WELL YOU USE A E HA TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
3891,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING
3892,YEAH YEAH THAT'S,YEAH YEAH THAT'S
3893,HI,HI
3894,THERE'S ONE HUNDRED,IIS ONE HUNDRED
3895,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F N,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL FIN
3896,YEAH,YEAH
3897,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS

3899,Y LIKE THIS,E LIKE THIS
3900,YES YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY,YEAH YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY
3901,YEAH,YEAH
3902,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGOU ABOUT EVERYTHING
3903,BECAUSE I WAS OUR S THE STRAWS ON OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE'S SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT,BECAUSE OUR WAS OURE ST THE STRAWS AT OUR TEEM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLES SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT
3904,YEAH,YEAH
3905,WE LEARNED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM CAN,WE LEARNED THAT THEMETRIC SYSTEM CAN

3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME CUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY G DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING IITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USED EMECTRICIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH THE'RE CONTRIES
3911,OH NO,I ON' KNO
3912,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF WE'RE ONE METRIC ONE METER HIGH NO,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF FOR ONE MAT'S  ONE METER HI NO
