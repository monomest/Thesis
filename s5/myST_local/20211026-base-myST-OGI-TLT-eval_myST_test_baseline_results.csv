0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY TWO
1,OKAY,OKA
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,AH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAFS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YE YE
4,YEAH,YE
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,OPROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASK WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE  LENGTH OF THE STRING
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,APROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE SAW IF THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YA A LITTLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SOTO THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEA CHAR AND WE SO A IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NTHE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE TIME IT WAS AM LENGTH IN THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE A TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AD THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THIT HUGED DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY  JUST FORGOT OR LIK DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS THET GOT SO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESK WHERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN AM THEN WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE AM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS T WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,ONYAW E S DID GRAPHING TOYESTERDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,AM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY
14,MATH,LAUGHED
15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,O CA
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE ITHINK THE THE LEAST WINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,UM YA PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED
19,OKAY,O ETIN
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YA AT FIRST WE TWE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS AM LENGTH AM A STARTING POINT AND THEN UM A LIKE THE FORCE SAY THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FOURTH FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
21,YEAH,DER
22,OKAY,ATA
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO M AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AN STUFF AND THEN AM THE I I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST WINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN I'M TO MAKE THE STHE PENDULUM SWING LESS WINGS THAN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOUL HAVE TO MAKE THE PETHE PENDULUM STRING LONGER
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YES WE'S DON PENDULUMS SO LIKE AMWE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE LIKE WE WERE TESTING UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BEBEUM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOMELIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,O KAY
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'TTDONE THAT YET
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YA THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED WAS PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YE LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUST WANTED TO HELP TOUT I GUESS
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YA
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE WWE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WEHOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AN THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN
34,UM WE,AM WE
35,WE WERE USING,WE WERE USING
36,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN ITWE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE WE TESTED WITH A DIFFERENT THING IN STUFF
37,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP,A YEF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP
38,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WEVE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES OM WERE HOW FAR OR M HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE ANLIK YE IT'S THE LITTLE FLIPSTICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN A'M ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIPSTICK
39,YEAH,YE
40,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,I'M TO GRAPIT SO YOU KNOW WEL WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'V BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT AM EXPERIMENTS IN STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS AN A OM WHAT ELSE WE DID AM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS
42,YEAH,YE
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THEN WHEN WE WIN THE CWEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO SO THAT'S MAY BE WHY MISS MOJAR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE
44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAT BUTN BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,THE'RE AM M THERE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YE IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY DNEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN STUFF
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,AMWE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THE MONOGRAPH
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IND WENT UP
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,NOW WE JUST FINISHD DOING THE FLIPPERS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,UUM YE AND THEN AFTWELL THEN WE TESTED IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHEN PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO WAN E TO
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER IN STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET THE FOUR CAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT A FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT WE DID T FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WE ADDED ALL THOSE TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YE
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WE ALL CAME UP WITH THER VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS STAND AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE XAXESS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE WY AXCESS WELL THE WY AXES IS RIGHT HERE THE EXCESS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED AN LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AN SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE WY AXES THERE WAS AM WA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR I WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,ARGRAP IDON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE'S AN EX AXIS IN A WY AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE WY AXIS WAS WIT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND NOW
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE WY AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ILLUMINED BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T M THEYTHEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,HU AND THEN WEL SO SIN SIX WAS ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT NTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WWHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND SHE CHOSE TO PEOPLE TO TRY AME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO AN I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE
63,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO
64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,THAT WAS FURTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UMIT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH SUM IIT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS OTH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELTHE POWER FTHROUGH I GUES
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,WE MADE PLANS THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GIT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLAINE SO I BET THE  THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GOIN TO GET THE MORS THE MOR SPIN WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TO DAT WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YA AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRADED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK A TOWE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE JUST JUST GES WHAT NUMBER
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YA AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED LIKE TO JUST PLIT AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIENC MENT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE END O THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT A SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P  SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO
71,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL NO HE REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN NE THAT WOULD BE COOL
72,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETE FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOUR METERS,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETR FOUR HUNDRED TENIMETRS IS FORME
73,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YE ACLIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WALL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY SO THEN WE JUST CIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND PRETTY MUCH WA EXACTLY
74,YEAH,YES
75,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YA WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ONOH YA WE'RE SKEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING FORTY SPINS DOES N'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
76,YEAH YEAH,YE  I OEMER THE SAE YA
77,YEAH,YA
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE BLAINS CAUS IT'S LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM PLY L I WANT THE SWINGERS CAUSE THWE HAVE THIS VARIABLE'S BOOK AND ITS SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AN THE FORCE ON FORCE WAS A A WOMAN DOING ALIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HAND SPRING OFF THE WAS SHE WAS DOING A VALT AND I DO WALT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH
79,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GOSALI OH YA FOUR METERS
80,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN AS LIKE SO YOU GO ROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YE ONE TWO LIKE YA AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY TTESTED IT LIKE ONCE
81,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PARTED FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS AM BU SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED
82,I DON'T KNOW,A EN AL SINS ESIS
83,OH YOU'RE WELCOME OKAY,OFLEROFCASCA
84,HELLO,LO
85,YEAH YEAH,YA YES
86,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,O THE AL THER UM FLINGERS THEFIPPERS AND THEN WE EV WRE THE A LHE PENGULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS A SO
87,YEP,YES
88,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO HO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING IT AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWAY SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE N ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KI I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE,YE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALF WAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO WE TRIED TO DO A WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTINATED AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE OM SWANT SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST CUN'T TII THINK WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE
89,GLIDER THE PROPELLER THING,GLIDE THE PROPELLER THING
90,YEAH WE GET TO USE IT AND S CAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FANS SO AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND IT GOES IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT'S WE'RE DOING S LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHER'S UM ARM SPANS LIKE WING SPAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN SO,YA WE GET TO USE IT ANDCAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FAN SO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND TIT GOES  JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT WE'RE DOING LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHERS UM ARMS SPANS LIKE WINGSPAN SO IT'S WAYG BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN S
91,YEAH YEAH AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE DOING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THE OUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING UM SLOPE,YE YE AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE TEWING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THOUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTNESS UP THE STRING UM SLOPE

111,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERYONE GOT A DIFFERENT UM MILLILITER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PA NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT W NUMBERS OF MILLILITERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERYONE GOT A DIFFERENT AMILLOLEATER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PNUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF MILILETERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW
112,AND THEN AFTER WE PUT UM I GOT SEVENTEEN PENNIES BEFORE MY BOAT SANK AND THEN SO YEAH,AND THEN AFTER WE PUT EM I GOT SEVENTEEN PENNIES BEFORE MY BOAT SANK AND THEN SO YE
113,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF THE GRAPH OH YEAH THANK YOU AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOAT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOAT FOUR BUT I'M AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF THE GRAP OH YE THINK YOU AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOT FOUR BUT UNNUCHES AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME
114,WELL I RE I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OUR BUT UH WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETER I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AMO MILLILITERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY,WELL I I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OURS BUT A WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETERS I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE A MILLILETERS AND THEN A I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO DAY
115,YEAH CAUSE THIS IS THE Y AXIS I THINK X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE Y AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGERS,M ECAUSE THIS IS THE WY EXESS I THING X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE WHY AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGER
116,UM THAT WAS WE WOULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY IN S YOU COULD JUST FLIP OVER,M THAT WAS WE WU WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THED PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE Y ATO SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WERE ITS TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSIT OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOUDON' WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY AN COULD JUST FLIP OVER
117,UM CAPACITY IS SORT OF THE WATER HOW MUCH WATER YOU GOT IN IT AND THEN YOU DO,UM CAPACITY IS SORT OF THE WATER HOW MUCH WATER YOU GOT IN IT AND THEN USITUAS ITI
118,I'M ALMOST DONE,MOMOST DON
119,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS AND STUFF YEAH UH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND UH THEN,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS IN STUFF WAW IT WOUD A OUAH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND AH THEN

121,UH LESS BECAUSE THIS E IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND IT ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND,ORL AH LES BECAUSE THIS IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE  MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILILETERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND I ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLALETERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND S
122,AND THEN PASSENGERS,AND THEN PASSENGERS
123,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N E CAUSE MY K PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FI SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE IT'S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN UP HERE YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE,AND THEN SO ANWE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N  CAUSE MY PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED TH THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETOR ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FISEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE SRAIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN  GOCLEA YES AND THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE
124,YEAH,SSA
125,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID A WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VOTES AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVEWE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
126,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY UM IT WAS JU THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY WHATWULD TE AM IT WAS J THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW
127,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,OCAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TO DAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND AM THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIK TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN
128,NO,NO
129,OH YOU CAN HAVE IT,OH YOU CAN HAVE IT
130,YEAH CAUSE LIKE,YA CAS LIKE
131,YEAH,YE
132,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAPH A LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO,AH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAFFALAT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO
133,IT WAS LIKE A PAGE WE GOT,IT WAS LIKE A PAGE WE GOT
134,LIKE PROBABLY,LIKE PROBABLY
135,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOUGH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL AND LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE,AH YA WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAFF IT WAS CALLED THOUGH TUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL LIKE ON THE GRAF WE GRAFT WITH LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE ED SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILILETERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY A PASSENGERS I GOT SO YESHARED
136,WE PUT EM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN THEY WERE OUR PASSENGERS,WE PUT EM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN WTETHEY WERE OUR PASSENGERS
137,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE I SO NOW O
138,YEAH,YE
139,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN AND WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S E N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN WE'D PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S  N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTEMETER BOL WE GOT A HUNDRED AN FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN IT WAS OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVENMUS O TA YA LIKE YE LOIT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PRABLAS IA
140,YEAH,YE
141,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PR YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS,WELL YA BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE YEA ITSAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTION
142,AND THEN,AND THEN WHY DID YOU PICK UP THE HORSE
143,YEAH,YE
144,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AM ACWELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTALUSERS AND THEN AM WE DID THAT BECAUSE AM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUARTED WATER FROM A SERINGE INTO IT AND THEN SSUCKED IT UP WITH THE SORINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADULATED SECYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
145,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH OH OCAY THAT O CA I THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING EL SO AH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO AFFECT THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS ANDYU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
146,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING,AM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING
147,YEAH,YE
148,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DI THIS WAS OUR TWO CENTEMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PRAV WE DIDN'T RELY TIV TO THREESIN  YA IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS
149,YEAH,YE
150,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,A WE DID DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO CALLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR A YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THA WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO
151,BOATS I THINK WHAT LI UM,BOT I THINK WE I AM
152,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,YA YA WE DID WE I SORT OF FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT HERS WE TALKED ABOUT A WADNOTHING AND SUC
153,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME
154,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER VOATES FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RAIN OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
155,YEAH,T
156,UM YEAH,AMYE
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,A BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE SAY THE ORHO CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GT FIFINDIN AA CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIN FER TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,YE PROBABLY YE YE
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME SO
160,YEAH,YES
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YA IBECAUSE DYOU WANT TO FIND WE WANT TO HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL O IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANT TO KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IANEND LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL O OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OR OUR A OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A UM ALL IN ALL UM MOT A A THREE CENTEMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE SENTWELVE PENNIES
162,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME AN SHE'S OVER THERE YE AM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LLESS NO LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TO DAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS LOAD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES AND I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM
163,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'TKNOW
164,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE SATURATED SOLUTION SOMETHING LIKE THAT NO THE START OVER,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE SETRED FOLE SOMETHING LIKE NO THE STARTO
165,IT SATURATES,A SEART YOUR HEADS
166,IT RISES,IT RISES
167,GOOD,GO
168,I DON'T KNOW,I DIDN NOW
169,YOU POURED THE SALT AND IT GOES TO THE BOTTOM THEN YOU SHAKE IT AND IT DISSOLVES,YOU POURED THE SALT DNIT GO TO THE BOTTOM ON YOUR SHARE YOMSELVES
170,I DON'T KNOW,GOT E NOW
171,THERE'S WATER IN THE BOTTLE AND YOU PUT THE SALT IN THE WATER TIL IT'S,THERE'S WATER IN THE BOTTLE AND YO  YOU GET READY TO POLL DOWN Y LI PUT THE SALT IN THE WATER UNTIL IT RIGT OUT WIAI LET'S GO LFINDIN A
172,WE PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER AND MIXED IT UP UNTIL IT WAS SAT,WE PUT THE SOUNT INTO THE WIN WESTAYED UP UNTIL IT WAS SE
173,UM,O
174,THE WATER IS SATURATING,THE WATERSATURATED
175,THING,THINK
176,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE AND WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEN THEN YOU SHAKE IT AND SAW THE WATER RISE,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE A WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILIMETERS OF WATER WHY THEN WE SHAKED IT AND SAW THE WATER RISE
177,IT TAKES LONGER FOR THE EPSOM SALT TO DISSOLVE,IT TAKES LONGER FOR THE ABSENCE OT TO DISSOLVE
178,AND SIX SPOONS OF SUGAR IT MAKES THE WATER SATURATED,AT SIX SPOONS OF SUGAR I MAKES E WATER SATRATE
179,SOMETHING,SOMETHING
180,THERE'S SALT,THER SALT
181,GOOD,TI
182,THE THE SALT SOLUTION WEIGHTS SEVENTEEN GRAMS MORE THAN THE THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER,THETHE SALTSUBLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS MORE THAN THE THAN THE FIFTY MILLIA LETERS OF WATER

857,A STANDARD MEASUREMENT E IS LIKE THE METRIC SYSTEM IT'S ALL THE SAME EXCEPT FOR IN AMERICA,A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IT IS LIKE THE METRIC SYSTEM IT'S ALL THE SAME EXCEPT FOR INAMERICA
858,JUST A SEC,JUST AS I
859,YEAH,YE
860,I COULD TELL THEM A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,I COULD TELL THEM A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS O KILEGRAM
861,YES YOU NEED TO HAVE A STANDARD TO DO,YES YOU NEED TO HAVE A STANDARD TO DO
862,WELL TODAY WE HAVEN'T DONE MATH YET,WELL TO DAY WE HAVEN'T DONE MATH YET
863,YOU PUT THE GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY MEASURED OUT UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY LEVEL IT'LL,YOU PUT THE GRAND PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY MEASURED OUT UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY LEVEL IT'LL
864,THE INK,THE INK
865,WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS IT'S JUST,WE DI DO THIS IN CLASS IS JUS
866,B L T,V L T
867,UM WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS IS JUST BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE,WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN CLASS THIS AS JUST BACK OUR KNOWLEDGE
868,BUT WE HAD GROUPS OF FOUR,BUT WE HAD GROUPS OF FOUR
869,HELLO,HELLO
870,OR A MICROWAVE,OR A MICER WAVE
871,NOT REALLY,NOT REALLY
872,AND THEN WE PUT IT OUR HUNDRED GRAMS INTO ONE BIG BAG,AND THEN WE FUET OUR HUNDRE GAME LOS O ONE BIG BAG
873,UH A D A POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS,AA POKER CHIP THAT WAS LIKE SIX GRAMS
874,OKAY LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A STEEL BALL JUST COMPLETELY CIRCULAR STEEL BALL AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND THEN A VASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOWL SO THE WHEN THE WATER FALLS OUT IT'LL GO INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL INTO THE WATER MOST OF THE YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WATER'S IN IT THOUGH FOR THIS TO WORK WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL IN WHEN THE WATER COMES OUT AS MUCH WATER IS STILL IN THE VASE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S IN IT BECAUSE IT PUSHES IT OUTWARD UNTIL IT'S SETTLED,O KAY LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A STEEL BALL JUST COMPLETELY CIRCULAR STEEL BALL AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND THEN A VASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOWL SO THAT WHEN THE WATER FALLS OUT IT'LL GO INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO IT WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL INTO THE WATER MOST O YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WATER'S IN IT THOUGH FOR THIS TO WORK WHEN YOU PUT THE STEEL BALL IN TWHEN THE WATER COMES OUT AS MUCH WATER S STILL IN THE VACE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S IN IT BECAUSE IT PUSHES IT OUTWARD UNTIL IT'S SETTLED
875,WHAT HAVE WE WORKED ON THIS WEEK WELL THIS WEEK THE IN THE THREE DAYS IN THIS WEEK WE'VE WORKED ON MEASUREMENT AND MASS,WHAT HAVE WE WORKED ON THIS WEEK WELL THIS WEEK THE IN THE THREE DAYS IN THIS WEEK WE'VE WORKED ON MEASUREMENT AND MASS
876,UH HUH OR LEVEL,U FOOR LEVEL
877,HOW THAT WORKS IS IT'S LIKE A PRESS,HOW THAT WORKS AS IT'S LIKE A PRESS
878,I KNOW AS IN LIKE KILL A GRAM,I KNOW TO SEN LIKE KILL A GRAHAM
879,HOW DO I MEASURE MASS WITH THE BOWL AND THE THE UM VASE AND THE STEEL BALL OR OR ANYTHING YOU WANT LIKE AN ORANGE OR,HOW DO I MASURE MESS WITH THE BOLL AND THE THE UM VASE AN THE STEEL BALL OR OR ANYTHING YOU WANT LIKE AN ORANGEER
880,YOU HAVE TO DEPEN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON,UT YE HAVE TO DEPEND IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU PUT IT ON
881,WE PUT IN TEN OF THOSE,WE PUT IN TEN OF THOSE
882,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED,NO BUT EACH GROUP WE MADE TWO BAGS FULL OF A HUNDRED
883,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILOGRAM,A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS A KILDRAM
884,GRAMS YEAH OH I JUST THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE,GRAHAMS YES OH I JUST THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE
885,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SOMETHING IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP,I'D SAY MASS IS THE AREA THAT SUMTHOUT IS THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING TAKES UP
886,HA IT WEIGHED LIKE TWENTY,IT WAIED LIKE TONNY
887,THAT THAT WOULD BE WAIT JUST A SEC,THAT THOU WOULD BE WADRES TO SUCK
888,SEVEN SEVEN INCHES,SEVEN SEVEN INCHES
889,PROBABLY THE MASS,PROUDLY THE MASS
890,AND THAT ADDED UP IN TO TWO HUNDRED,AND THAT I OUNDED UP IN TO TWO HUNDRED
891,WE HAD A SCALE,WE HAD A SCALE
892,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME,BUT DEPENDING ON THE PAPER CLIP THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME
893,YES,YES
894,IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE MORE HEAVY,IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE MORE HEAVY
895,MMM HMM AND THEN PUT THEM INTO A ONE BIG BAG AND THEN IT EQUALED ONE KILOGRAM,AND THEN PUT THEM INTO ONE BIG BAG NEE EQUAL TON KILSER
896,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OF A TOASTER WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WHEN IT'S ON,HOW WOULD I FIND THE MASS OTA TOASTOR WATER EXCEPT FOR NOT WEN IT'S ON
897,NO BECAUSE ALL PA THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE IT'D BE SMALL,NO BECAUSE I'LL PATHERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE I'D BE SMALL
898,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MATH MASS IS WITH WATER O A BOWL AND A VASE,HOW DO YOU MEASURE MOTH MASS IS WITH WATER A BOWL AND A VASE
899,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRAM PIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OUR GRAM PIECES WE MEASURE LIKE E THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE GRAM PIECES,WHAT WE DID WITH OUR GRANDPIECES WAS WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE USING OUR GRANDPIECES WE'D MEASURE LIKE THIS PIECE OF WOOD EQUALS THREE GRAND PIECES
900,WELL THE MASS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASS THAT THESE TAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT QUARTERS OF THIS TABLE,WELL THE MASS OF SOMETHING IS LIKE THE MASS THAT THETAKES UP IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT QUARTERS OF THIS TABLE
901,YES,YES
902,SO IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SI SIX SIX FIVE GRAMS,SO IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SIX SIX SIX FIVE GRAMS
903,BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE RIGHT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE RIGHT IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN

1086,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE AS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AN THE OTHER CLASS MADE TEN  THE ELDER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THERE O DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM
1087,WELL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT IN MATH SOON,WILL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING MEASUREMENT AN MOUNTS TO
1088,WELL THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FULL IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS,WHILE THE ESTIMATING LIKE THE ESTIMATING WAS ESTIMATING ISN'T A FAULT IS IT'S LIKE A GUESS
1089,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MATH CLASS,WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO MATH TO HELP US AND THIS IS MY MOUTH GLASS
1090,E IT NO I DON'T REMEMBER,E  NO I DON'T REMEMBER
1091,A HAN B A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TWENTY CENTIMETERS,HAN A HAND WOULD BE NOT A METER BUT LIKE TRE ANMERS
1092,YEAH,WELL YOU WANT O
1093,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A ME THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN A METER SORRY,THERE'S TEN METERS IN IN A MA THER'S TEN CENTAMETER IMETER SO
1094,NO EVERY TEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR,NO EVERY TANNOWIS A DIFFERENT COLOR
1095,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES,YES WHY THAT IS IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET ONE STANDARD MEASUREMENT YES LIKE THAT PIECE OF DUST
1096,NO,NO
1097,YEAH,YES
1098,YEAH YARD STICK IS JUST LIKE THAT BIG AND YEAH,YE YARDSTICK IS JUST LIKE THAT PIG AND YA
1099,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT,WELL WE HAD TO MEASURE IT WE HAD TO MEASURE IT
1100,WE WE IN TODAY'S MATH STUMPER WE WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS L ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS,WE WE IN TO DAY'S MATH STUMPER WE LE HADTO ISID ASKED THE MATE IS IT ASKD THE MATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS
1101,NO BOTH WAYS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETER OH NOT THE PERIMETER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YEAH YEAH,NO BOTH WUS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN TIS PRIMITER OH NOT TO PERMURTER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YE I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YET YET
1102,HOW MANY CENTIMETERS JUST A SEC A HUNDRED,HOW MANY SENTTIMETERS JUST THE SEK A HUNDRED
1103,WELL H H I WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG,WELL I WOUN WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOURE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GIF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG
1104,WELL WELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS,WELL WHAT WEVE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILIMETERS METERS
1105,YEAH,DE
1106,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS,THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT SIZE STRAWS
1107,WAIT NINE,OFWAIHT NINE
1108,JUST A LITTLE SLEEVE,IT E LITTLE SLEEV
1109,THOSE MARKS WERE FOR A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,THOSE MARKS WERE FOR A STANDARD MEASUREMENT

1121,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCEANS I DON'T F I DON'T FULLY REMEMBER THOUGH,IT'S THE LENGTH BETWEEN TWO OCIANS OCA I DON'T I DON'T ULY REMEMBER VOLA
1122,IS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT,I'S BECAUSE YOUAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL GIDET
1123,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REAL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTOR'S USE YEAH,Y HEAWE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGERIN NOLAG AREL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTORS USE LIPIS ERANGE YE
1124,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING TO PLAY WITH THE WATER,WHAT DID I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT GETTING A PLAY WITH THE WATER
1125,THAT IT TAKE UP YEAH IT'S LIKE GALLONS,THAT ULD TAKE HE YES I GALLANT
1126,MAYBE A HUNDRED,MAY BE HUNDRED
1127,A HUNDRED,WISH THAT I'L BE WRIGHT TO A HUNDRED
1128,A HUN TEN,OTEN
1129,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS FOR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LITER,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT IS OF OUR TEN GROUPS IT WAS ONE LEADER
1130,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S ABOUT IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK
1131,THESE TWO AND THESE TWO ARE THE SAME,THESE TWO AND THESE TOWARD THE SAME PARTES

1151,YES,YES
1152,YOU'RE MEASURING THE WEIGHT OF IT,YURA MEASURING THE WEIGHT OF IT
1153,DOESN'T LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE A SPOON NO,BOVMO PRAY WY ENES BOON IS NOT YOUR BIG NO
1154,WELL UM WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE,WELL I WHAT I LIKE MEASURING THE BEST IS USING THE SCALE
1155,LITER,READER

1161,NO MILLILITERS,NOW MILLA LEATERS
1162,MMM HMM A HUNDRED,NYTHIR TIS IT TAKE TO MAKE TO FILL UP THIS BY A HUNDRED
1163,AND WE SQUIRT SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS ARE LIKE THAT BIG,AND WE SQSEE HOW MANY VILES I THAT THE PLUNDER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VILES ARE LIKE THAT BITK
1164,IS TEN,IS TEN
1165,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
1166,TEN OR MAYBE MORE YEAH,TENER MAY BE MORE TO
1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,SHE MEAN OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASED THE MO OF BATTERIES AM LAKE LAKE TIRD LIKE WHEN I RAPPED AROUND UN O RINTS IT PICKED UP THER DY WASHES CASAD TWO BATTER
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,WA A MONOL CRISMORA THE LINTA HAS MORE THATTERS AFOR
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,I REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WHILE THE MORE YOU RAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCE
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSE SER CE UM AM IT CONNECTS THE WASHES STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TUCKET I DOES
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINUSED THE LINE TO SEVEN I MADE TO TU ON UM IAD NESED THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT I DISCOVER IS WHEN I PUT MOR RAPP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT AM A MORM A WASHER STICK TO I
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,TITS ATTACHED TO THIRTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WEL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED WINGS OM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUP BEFORE  IT ONLY PICKED UP I ONLY PICKED UUUUP TOM WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS TO I ADDED UP A FIVE MORE
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,HE WIRES WRAPPD AROUND A A RIVET
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,MINCREASE WEN I DOA  PICKS UP TO THE LOWER CASONA PUT HER UP TO THIRTY A PICKED UP AT LHEWAT OR OPENING BUT IT SOA HUNDRED WINDS I AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,WHAT IT RELATES IS
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,WHAT TE PORIN IS THERE IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS A O IT HAS TO BE AT ISA CLOS CIRCLE EVERYTHING
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TUTY SELLS WORK WITH THE AVERSE ON DECEL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES ER GOES UP TO
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,E ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE VERBIT
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC DESTROVIESADMAR BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,TOMORO OM MID  YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENIN  THE STRENGTH IS IT GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT I SANLABOT A MEVLOGRAPH IS M NUMBERS
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WAT HAPPENED WHEN TE OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER PATTER MY SONS
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,ERMA HAS TO FLOAT THROUGH A BASIN WATER AND A CASING WATER
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERE IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FORMING A PETIL AN ELIGHTFUL INEFABLE MASHANING WICE E REBRETH
1189,NO,MY PUNIS LAUGHED CA
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT ISN'T ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLYING THROUGH BECAUSE ANY SO BE TURNED AROUND A AMISTER ANDREWS CAF TO HAVE A MUGEDIM IN THE POSOF ECLASE OA CAR TOUCHING EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO RATMIK TE LIGHTBOLSLIT
1191,UM IT WILL <unk> IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,UM IT'LL IT'LL DELIGHTFUL JUNTION BRIGHT AND BREGULAR ERCCAK LIKE TITALIT AND TEFURNITA
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS <unk> RIGHT,IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UM IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE TIS ELECTRICITY WILL LIN OUT AND THER'S CERTAIN  KINDS OF DIFFEREN FOD BUT AN INSIDE IT SHINES BRIGHTER
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES US A CIRCUIT IS UM WHE WHEN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE DESAL BETTY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CISSHING WIRE AND THE BASING WI
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,THE BOLLOF MIS LA TO THE AORE WE PETAT OFIM
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEY'LL BE AFFECTED BY GETTING  BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I OBSERVE IS WHEN YOU I JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TO LIGHT BOBS IT'LL ITL BE DULL AND A WONT SHIPRIGHT BUT IF YOU HAD TWO BATTERIES IT'LL ONLY TWO LIGHT BOLB CHAMBRADER
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS TROU THE MATTER THO THE M TE LIGHT BALL
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THRO
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONCE A PATHWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IN SIENC IS LATING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BOLBS
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,SI THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS TIT IT WILL SHIT LOWER AND LOWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT A BATTERY WITH BATTERYU PUT THE
1203,OKAY,A GREAT
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT <unk>,AND IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECUT INAR HE MICACO
1205,FINISH,FINISHED
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,ATINUALLY PEPORVE BO NOT LOS
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,O TO AD CALL IS LON E MA I  WE LO PATO TANS A USHI O O ORA HE CU NO O ENJOY E ISAR DA A  PIECE OF WOK E ASIOE O A ON  OF TE JANOF TO NATTA ARAGOS
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE JESIL BATTERY AND IT WHAT BOTH TE LIRES HAS TO BE ON A BASIN WIRE AND ON A CASINWIRE
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,UT WHEN WE AD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEKOR
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ASO TE LITS CAV ECASOF FOR THE C
1211,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR ITS USED TO
1212,IT IT TURNS INTO THE,A FOR CHANGE INTO HER GOLY E
1213,COLORS,COLOR SESSY
1214,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE HE SAYS RED ORSUPOS TO BE RED
1215,UM CHANGING COLOR,AM E ASCHANGING COLOR
1216,UM IT WILL TURN DARK,OM IWILL TURN DARK
1217,CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS,ILE CHANGE THE SAM GOODA OURS BO E FILM TI
1218,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,UM IT'S NO USE TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAS GREEN LIME AND IT'S PUSTBE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
1219,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,WHICH IF THE PRISOM IS CAGINGIC COLOR
1220,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,AND WOULD LA HAVE TE REFERCTUN OF A CAREER S TAT O NOW
1221,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,ITS A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FTO A PRERSON
1222,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S EN BECAUSE ISPERREFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOUR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
1223,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIY KEEPS ON BUSHING OFF OF OBJECTS WOTH THE COLOR BLUE
1224,SEVEN SIX,AND THEN SEVEN AGA TO LOK
1225,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,WERT HOWEV REFLECKS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE ATO VIOLET AR PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED
1226,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,THE LIGHT IS REFLEEDI RALIBOL
1227,THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR,THE REFLEXER WAS USED TO TO MIXING THE COLO
1228,TURNS INTO,T CHANCIAL ROLIN
1229,UM STRUCTURE OF A LIGHT,NAN AVEES STRUCTURE OF THE LIT
1230,A RED,A THE RET
1231,UM IT'S REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE OR THE,NO EQUIT WE AM BUT NATS REFLECTING OFF IS A BLUE O AV THE O CLAR
1232,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF AM LIGHT GREEN AND AM ORANGE BON IC YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIFE
1233,BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME COLOR,BECASE IS HA THE SAME COLOR
1234,TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,TURNING TO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
1235,YES THE REFLECTION THE COLOR,YES THE REFLECTION AND THE COLOR
1236,UM THE LIGHT LITTLE REFLECTS OFF THE LIGHT,IT WAS E ONLY E WEN E YABO E TATO LE AN EVITEOFIOUS ELEMENT SOMETHING OUT O THERANGDRAKT OF TO BROUD
1237,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF
1238,SIX COLOR,SIX SCOL
1239,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF IN ECAGESINT COLOR
1240,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SOLARBELS AND OM CIRCUS SAN THAT THEY DI OP
1241,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,O WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURN DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YA IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CARTIT'S WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE
1242,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT,THE ILL HAVE LIGHT
1243,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,ON NA UM I'LL ONCE BESO TEKNAT A NO RASHES TE BREAK IT
1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,AND BY IS FORCE
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FORCE WAS THE STRONG ENOUGH
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,WAT A DOESN'T A MIXD OPERS A WEEKR
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNAT IS AN DE THE PAPEREDTOF NEPPROCLIPISUM TOPAN IT MOVES AT AR
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGET WAS YOUR NEST WAS TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETMAMANTICINA
1249,THE MAGNET <unk> THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNET THE MAGNET IS OM O IS UNDERD LIK STOCK AND IN GEORGIES MOVE IN THE MAGNET AN THE PAPER CLO CASNOW WANTED TEM CONNECTED TO
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN I JUST ENTERED ONE WASH E IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE  BECAUSE OF THE SPECERS
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE OTHE SPECIS MADE TO FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSERVE HAPPENING IS LIKE AN INTEM PRESSING THE WASHES GOIN
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT IS THE VONUBALIAD ON SPACERBREAKS IST FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM IS NOT REALLY ETSTIK ON
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,OR WHATIT DOES IT MAKS TU O MATTER MAKES THEAMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TO MAGNETS
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS AN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAK MAGNETS AND OOTHER CUP TO SEE MHOW MANY AM WASHES A BREAK O THE MAGNETS FALL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE BIRD IS USED TA MAGNIT TO SOME OF THE PARTAY IS FORCED ENOUGH
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEY GIVE FOR THEIR PART THE FIRST FORC COS A WEAKER BECAUSE THEREIS THE MOTHER MAGNETS MAGNETISM AND FORCE OF THE HORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,THERE IS SPREADING APART
1260,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M TRYIN WHEN I GOT UP A TO HA MAK WASHAS I COULD GO UP TO THE I BROKE I TE FALL
1261,MAGNETISM,OMAGNICTISM
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WAT'S GOING ON HEREFWHEN THY PRESS BACERS WHEN I AD THEM TH MAKNAK GETS TALLER BUT THE RAGNIKS ARE STILL TOUCHING ECH OTHER
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,IT GOWS BIGGER THAN THAN IT GROWS SMALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES AM MAKES THE FOS KIND O WEAKER ECURWICR INSTADER BEING STRONGER HAN USUALLY THE FORCIT
1265,I NEEDED THREE,I NEDED THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,BUT I'VE NOTICEIS WHEN ITS LESS THAN ONE'S LIKE WHEN IT''S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER A THE MAGNET CAL HOLD THE PAPER
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S SUFFERING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORSE BOWIN BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL AN A MUMMY THAT KIND OF A A THE KIND OOOF AMMUM MAGNET IN THEM THAT'S ALL IHAP
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THIS VA ONCE WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPER CLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF IT
1269,<unk> THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,A OSAC TIN LIKE A
1270,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL WITH THE THIN ONE IT WAS LIKE OONE I GUESS LER I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER TO A TASY BCAUSE IT'S THICK IN THE T A WILOF A LOT AN THEN I SAW TE MISEMENTS GOING LIKE THAT AND YOU'R KIND OF LIKE MY
1271,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE THICK PIECE  PEOPER IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK AND THE THIN WONA KAT BEGINS ITS OVY
1272,BUT THE DIFFERENT <unk> PUSH BACK,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AN WHY THEY PUSHED BACK
1273,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNE MIXTURE THROUGH AN ITIS REALLY REALLY NEO GET DOWN WITH THIS PLACEPLEASE
1274,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,OET IS UPTE THAT WITH E ASSIGNED THINGS JUS
1275,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WEVE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT AM HAAKIT THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET CIS SO ON IT SO STRONG THA COULD GO THROUGH A NAIL IN ORDER TO HOLD A PAPER CL
1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,FOT I CAN SAY ABO TA IS TO ANY TEMD A MAGNET ON IT I  REACTS LIE
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISN'T IT ACTING LIKE A MAGT A  LIKE WEWHY YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND N ELECTRICIT AND CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH ANDS TO MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND REACTS LIKE A METAL
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,EN I TO MAKE I ON I STICK TO THE BIBY CLUB BUT WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PIPER C
1279,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHAT I BOLE ALONE WHO WO USED EFITETONOGATOR ISARTY TO FEKTECOPIN NAE
1280,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
1281,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT'S BECAUSE THER MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH NAPER GRAVNE AM PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S F
1282,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE I JUST SEE THE SAMETHING YOUR DREAMY LAST NIGHT
1283,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,WHY ARE YO SPSPETING MEAN MOVY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNANT THA NOW IN THE PAPER CLUP
1284,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WOTLSOPAE IS IT STUCK INTO A NAIL AND IT CONNECT TEINTEPET A
1285,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE
1286,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,WEN TO THE REGNADROPD IT WAN UNDOTHE TAPLE AND THEN THE MATIT STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET SCONDUCTING IT AND HOLDING IT
1287,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS TE FORCE I CAN STILL GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNETFORCE IS SO LIKE IT'S SO STRONG
1288,REPEAT THAT,REPEATED AGAIN LE
1289,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS RELOVED FROM THE NAIL AND LOE THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETIS
1290,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP<unk>,TWHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A MEDL AND A PIECE O PAPER CLUB
1291,LEARNNG ABOUT MAGNETISM,NOT GRAT
1292,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER,THE MAGNET AND THE PIBICUP CANNOT REPEL EACH OTHER
1293,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET AND A NAL AND ITS FIRST KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
1294,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD <unk> PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD UM PAPERCLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
1295,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK LITITING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETI
1296,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNUPTISM CROSSES OFF AND BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS MAKING IT
1297,THE <unk> FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THEFORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
1298,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET,IT CAN'T BECAS O THETHE MAGNEATEM FOR
1299,THE LIGHT BULBS ALL OF THEIR ELECTRICITY AND,LIGHTBULBS ARE ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY AS
1300,OKAY,LO CA
1301,A D CELL BATTERIES AND,A DESHAL BATTERIS ATI
1302,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS  LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONECT THE ENERGY TO GO THR
1303,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOT OF A ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND LET THE LIGHT FALL
1304,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,THINK IF I BOTH CONNECTED THEWISE THROUGH THE FACE FAL I WHAT IT REALLY WED BECOMES THIN PLASTIC IS HOLDI
1305,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THE ARE TE DUCALL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT B
1306,BUT I NOTICE IS SOME IMPORTANT THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT,WOULD I NOTICE THES JUMSON CERTAIN PARTS THER AR LIVES CONNECT
1307,THE ELECTRICITY FLOW,ELECTRICITY FOR
1308,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,AKTHE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN IT WOULD SWICH THE DECAL A IT CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE POSITIVE SLAB IS GOING TO ETHY DIRECTION
1309,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING ADD OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITIES FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SI
1310,WITH THE AT THE SAME WIRE AND YOU,IF I TAS BECAUSE I PUT A WOR BECAUSE IT'S BOTH AT THE SAME WAY AND YOU WALK PO
1311,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WENET WHATEVER'S HAD YOU JUST WHICH OTO IS STILL WORKS THE SAME WAY
1312,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOES IN THE CIRCUIT IS HELP MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
1313,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WAT ONE WIDER IS HEADING THROUGH THE PESAN WIRE ONE IT'S HEADING TO THE BASE WIER
1314,WIRES IN IT CIRCUIT CARRY,WIRES IN A CIRCIT CARRY
1315,OKAY BUT,O CA FI
1316,THE COMPONENT NEED TO BE RIGHT,THE CAFERN  MATE BE HOL FAR
1317,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY IF BATTERY GIVING IT IT'S,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE BATTERY GIVING IT ITS ENERGY TO PUSH ERIT THR
1318,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,BUT I NOTICE THAT I DIDIT GIVE DELIHBAL HER LIFE TO ENSORE TO ALIGHT UP THE FIT WITH  ENERG
1319,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT TE SHUT UP IS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH EFOLD WIERS IN TO THE LIGHT
1320,WHERE IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE D CELL <unk> WIRES,WHERE THE ELECTRICITY MOST  RELIGIOUS O IS FRO THE WAT BELOW WIRES
1321,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW THAT IS GOT,BETTERS ARE ALL ABOUT CIRKETS AN NOW BETTER'S GOT
1322,ELECTRICITY,THE BLUE DOLTS RO AS E ELECTRIC
1323,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A CIRCUIT CLYING ROUND AND ROUND THE LAKE WIT THE ELECTRICITY
1324,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE OM
1325,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITIS BLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIGHT IN THE NEGATIVE SIGHT
1326,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,LABLE TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUIT
1327,WHEN YOU PUT THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING TO,WHEN YOU FLIP THE DSO INSTEAD OF GOING TO PA
1328,ON THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH,ALL THE ENERGY IS GOING THR
1329,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATTERY HELPS WITH THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BALL TO HELP LIGHT IT ON AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
1330,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S IMPORTANCE OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK CUGO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU TREAD THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH I TO GET THE MAG
1331,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THO CIRCET IT'S IMPORTANT THAT  CIRCETIN HOWIT UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
1332,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,THEWIE THE RIVE THOGH THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THATS WA THE AM ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY COKLED THOUG
1333,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,I AK SO MAGNET ICBECADO  PICK UP ANYTHING THATS IRIS
1334,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY STOS GOES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORSE OF THE FORCEOCHAPIC CANACTIVIS I ALL THE WASHES CONNECT AND E NEGOS THROU E AM POSITIVE SIGT THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVES
1335,WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT,WE LEARNED ABOUT A ROP IS AR GETING EAM COS ER GET AFFECTED AND INO WAIT
1336,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BECAUSE ITS IRON OR STEEL SHE E MIRALY TIS A MIT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AN AN ONTO IT TO MAKE IT EME TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORC
1337,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,OTHE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE UP WERER IS O OM CLOSE
1338,SMALL,OSO
1339,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WILE THE CICUTR OF THE SPECH AT LEAST A SOMETHING HAS TO BE PLEGTUR OF A MAN NIK TE FORSOVE ELECTRICITY CA IS COL THROU SOMTHING THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE
1340,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,ASTER HAPPEN AT THE RIVER AND THE WIRES IS AM AN AS TO AT LEAST CONNECTS A WAR OR AT LEAST DO SUBTIN TO
1341,A RIVET,O RATHER
1342,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WEL WHEN ITS OPEN SIRCE TAM  WLASHES DON'T STICK TO THE THEPPTHE MEDO TING AN EN ON ITS CLOSE CIRCIT IT STICKS
1343,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN T GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT AGIVE MIT THE MAGNETIC COUR

1345,WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS IN,WHAT THAT RELATES HIS RICHES E AN
1346,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,PENSIVE WHEN IT HAS  CLOSER ATHE MAGNETIC FORCE IS A BLE TU SA WAT CONNECT WITH THE WATCHERS SAND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT OPEN IPIL
1347,THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,THAT IS ALL ABOUT ISER AMEGNEGATIVE FORCE
1348,IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE,OH IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
1349,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT,E COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
1350,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,WA JIS WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH ITTHE WASHERS BECAUSE I HAS NO LONGE COMPEL IT TO THE WIRE
1351,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF THE WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S SWITCHED IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF OF THE THING WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD AM NOTHING STIKS TOP BUT WHEN ITS FIXD IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING

1476,<unk> THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE <unk> THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,AMTHE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGT BULPSE THEY LIGHT UP IT BURNTS OUT AND YOU HAVE TO REPLACE WITH ANOTHER ONE
1477,IT IS FLOWING <unk> INTO THE POSSTIVE SIDE,IT IS RORING INTO THE POSITI S
1478,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T NOT <unk> LIGHTING WERE AND WHAT NOW ITS LIGHTING SO BRIGHT <unk> BECAUSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE,WHAT I NOTICE IS THE LIGHT BULP IS IN NOT LIGHTING WELL WHEN WELL NOW ITS LIGHTING S SO BRIGHT BBECAUSE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED T THE OPPOSITE SIDE
1479,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB WHEN BACK OUT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB BACK UP,THAT'S GOING ON WITH THA ELECTRICITY ITS GOIN THO TE LIPOL THEN BACK OUT THOUG E LITGART O THE BAKCAT
1480,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ON CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALOSICUDS HAVE MORE
1481,THAT ONE REMEMBER DIRECTION,TWHAT I REMEMBER IS ALSEHAS TO BE A CURENT AND A DIRECTION
1482,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN TERMS OF PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND SERIES CIRCUIT,BEEN LEARNING IN TINS OM PARALLEL CIRCITS AND SERI CIRCIT
1483,I THINK THE CIRCUIT ONE TOP <unk> BECAUSE <unk> THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND AN XC BUT LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY BRIGHT,I THINK THE SECOND ONE TOP BECAUSE THERE'S A LIGHT BALV AND I SE BOTH THE LIGHTROBS ARE SHINING REALLY BRIGHT
1484,OH WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES THE MORE ENERGY SOME MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU CAN LIGHT UP THERE IS ENOUGH NOT YOU ELECTRICITY FOR,WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BETTER TO ONE LIGHE PULP IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY THE MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU LIGHT UP THERE'S NOT ENOUGH JUICE OR ANGIEUR ELECTRICITY FOR IT
1485,UM MAGNETISM,MAGNETISM

1901,BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP,BUT AN ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP
1902,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,WI A DUS SESE KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US PISEY
1903,YEAH,A
1904,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,WELL OM BECAUSE AM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT AM WHAT WAS HALF WAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE AH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINCS DOES A PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY
1905,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALF WAY AND ALL THE WAY AN DUM SOMETIMES WHEN WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE ARM CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN I LIKE CLATE
1906,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,YE LIKE IT WON'T ITITI'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER WUD ME HADUBLE IT LIKE UM WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR ARPLANE W ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO WINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO SPIN MORE
1907,SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE,SORRY OTE AS MADE HIS RACKINGS O I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE
1908,YEAH,YE
1909,WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY THOUGH,WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT TO DAY THOUGH
1910,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN I I MAY HAVE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOUL MESS UP THE WHOLE ERATE
1911,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,WELL A WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO A MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MANY FANS AND WERE TTESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLAR
1912,A SANDWICH,A SANDWICH
1913,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WILL LIKE MY AM THE MANT GRE UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID AM THREE MAT THEY DID ONE SENNING LEANER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THE
1914,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE O THAT COULD BE GOOD VARIABLE WED AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO A ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH OP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AN IOF THE CUP AHU AND FIVE INCHES AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN WHEN THE HEIGHT IS AM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS AHA AH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YATDE
1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL  THE HEIGHTS M WE ITFOR SOME REASON OUR JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORD AND THE WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AND THE FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITAN E YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THE THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD U MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISEBOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISSHIP
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNY IS JUST TALL OF ASLEEP WE PUCR WE TRY TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LET GO TO THE SIDE
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,FEEL LIKE A SUPER STAR AHA LIK ALREADY KNEW THAT NO HENNING
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASH PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
1922,YEAH,YE
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,AM WILL ARCHIMINES I DON' PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF A QUESTNING M HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WITH THE MASS WITH THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,AHU AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTYS AN THREE THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OKIN AWELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT WAS WE TOOK THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I A THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL T ONE SIDE IT WAS GOING TO SINK EVEN FASTER SO
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,AM WE DID AM HOW BOATS FLOAT
1927,THE HEIGHT,THE HEIGHT
1928,MAYBE,MAYBE
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT CAN HOLD
1930,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE
1931,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,O WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS
1932,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CREWS BUILT MAYBE LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE M LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TAR IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT A GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT AM THE PEOPLE COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A GUDJILLION TIMES BIGGER SO
1933,YEAH,E
1934,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YEP WEN THE THREETHE FOR THE THREE WEL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD PUT IT UP PERRE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARDER GUN SARIGT AH WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARDER GUN WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO AS LIKE DOWN HERE A DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREES DOWN HERE DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT AL AN WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE
1935,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREE CENTIMETERS,THE MILLA LEADERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREE SENTILMETERS
1936,FIFTY S A HUNDRED AND THREE AND FIFTY SIX,FIFTY O IDO TE AND FIFTY SIX

1939,ONE MORE TIME,ER TIME
1940,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,AH GOOD WE GOT MORE THEN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND
1941,IS THIS THING ON RIGHT,IIS PINGORDO
1942,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,OH UM WEL I THIN THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU AREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANT TO PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE AM IT'S LIKE NOT IS PIG TARTA
1943,FIVE INCHES,FIVE INCHES

2007,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITLY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
2008,YEAH,GA
2009,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,OH WE HAD TO DO SORRY AM WE HAD TA SWE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AN OUR FIRST ONE WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY CLOSE TO THE KIND OF SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO BEN WENT ON
2010,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,M WHEN YOU TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE AM I LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CANNON POLE FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WERE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE
2011,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,YEL A LIKE WE KIND O DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL
2012,CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET YOUR RESULT,CAUSE THAT'S ONLY WAY YOUCON GET YOUR RESULT
2013,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WYES WE WELL AH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED AT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CETMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY I MIGHT AM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT
2014,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE UM OUR FOOPSTICK IS THE POPSCIL STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
2015,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE YOU'LL GET AM MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS SO THEN YOU'LD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TOLF THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE
2016,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,AM LIKE HAD IT WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICAL STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS E WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE AM ALLUMINUM FOIL AND WERE WE'RE KIND OF CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL AM ECAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AN THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY' SPUNTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLEAR DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IS AN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE AM HOW IREADDY SAI THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO AM AH
2017,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND AM AM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED N FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING A KIND OF TAPE MEASURING TAPE
2018,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND UM SO WE M OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR IT OUT IT IS NOT MATWY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CETING ITS AT A THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT
2019,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALTOGETHER SO AM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN S WAS
2020,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULT SO THAT'S HOW MYT HEE DECIDED HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND AM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR IT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LOKES AT THESE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DESIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR RESULT SO RECURN I MIXING MATH INTO THIS

2247,WE NEED WE NEED AN ANOTHER D CELL IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER,LONY QICK WHEN YOU ADDED NOTER TY YOSELF IT WILL LIGHT UP LATER
2248,THE D CELL HAD BEEN ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE IT MAY CONTAIN D CELL,THE D SEL HAS ELECTRICITY IN THERE SO IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BOB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND BACK INTO THE DECEIL
2249,ITS BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THE ENERGY,IT'S BECAUSE THE DSA HAS THE ENNERT
2250,THE D CELL,TO DE SO

2471,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
2472,IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM DANGIT I JUST FOR,IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRE CIRCITS O TING I JUST
2473,GOOD,GET
2474,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KINDA THING AND YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE U'M LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KIND OF THING AND YOU'D HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO
2475,THEY ARE I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THOUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE V FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH,THER ARE AINBOOT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THROUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY IT COME THROUGH
2476,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BOL WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE DESEL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NUT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT
2477,INTO THE LIGHT BULB,AND TWO DELIGHTFUL
2478,E PLACE WHERE,PLACE WHERE
2479,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM WHITE BULB
2480,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LHITE BULB TILL IT STARTS GOING AND THEN WHEN ITS GLOWING MORE ELECTRIS TRICIT FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINO SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT
2481,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOUD PUT IT
2482,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUSID AN MINUSIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED UP
2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURE
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE IN
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS AN VERY IMPORTANT ROLLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,AM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT AM THE SALT LAKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILE WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,IT IS CALLED WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,NO OKE AH GOOD
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMIMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER ITIS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S A SOLUTIO
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT M ITS PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING TSE AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND OM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STUFF AND THAT IND YE

2822,IT MEANS THAT UM IT POWERS A LIGHT BULB FOR THE ROOM TO GET LIGHTER,IT MEANS THAT UM IT POWERS A LIGHT BULB FOR THE ROOM TO GET LIGHTER
2823,THEY HELP POWER THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THEY GO OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER IT,THEY HELP UM POWER THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THEY GO UP TO E LIGHTBALL TO POWER
2824,WHEN THEY BOTH ON THE BOTTOM YEAH IT DOESN'T TURN ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING THAT WAY BUT WHEN ONCE ON THE SIDE AND ONCE UNDERNEATH THAN IT COULD WORK,WHEN THEY'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM M IT DOESN'T TURN ODD BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING THAT WAY BUT WHEN ONE'S ON THE SIDE AND ONE'S UNDERNEATH THEN IT COULD WORK
2825,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2826,IT CHANGES WHILE GOING THE OTHER WAY AROUND,IT CHANGES WHILE GOING THE OTHER WAY ROUND
2827,A D CELL BATTERY,A DSEL BATTERY
2828,THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE D CELL BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT THE LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE D CELL,THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING TO DECEL BATTERY AN THEN OUT THE DCEL BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BULBAND THEN OUT THE LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE DECEL
2829,THAT IS THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY,THAT THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED A DIFFERENT WAY
2830,UM IT GETS ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES TO LIGHT BULB,DARK AM IT GETS ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE LGHTTHFROM THE AM BATTERY TO THE WIRES TO LIGHTBALL
2831,I'M DOING GOOD,I'M DOING GOOD
2832,I THINK IT WOULD GET BRIGHTER TO BREAK THE BULB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK,I THINK IT WOULD GET BRIGHTER TO BREAK THE BALB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK
2833,IT GOES BACKWARDS SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT IS GOING BEFORE,IT GOES BACKWARD SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT WAS GOING BEFORE
2834,IT FLOWS BECAUSE IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY TO THE WIRES BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE WIRES KIND OF GET THE ELECTRICITY AND GOES THROUGH INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN,IT FLOWS BECAUSE IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY TO THE WIRES BECAUSE IT'S THE WIRS KIND OF GET THE ELECTRICITY AND IT GOES THROUGH INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN

2911,SO YEAH SO CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,SE E SI AMCAN YOU REPEAT THA
2912,I DON'T,I DON'T
2913,WELL THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIKE BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING EACH OF LIKE BULB TWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK TO LIKE BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK ITS TO THE A POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOESN'T AGAIN,WILL THE ENERGIES COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING INTO LIGHT BULP TOO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK THROUGH LIFE BALB ONE THEN GOES BACK INTOTHE A POSITIVE SIDE AN THEN GOES BACK UP THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOES THAT AGAIN
2914,SO MORNIE,SET MAR
2915,I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT,I THINK IT'S A SERIOUS CIRC
2916,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDES TOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE WIRES GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKE INTO,ON WEN THE POSIVE SIDE TOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDHE ESIDE END A WIREIS GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND TA UNONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT PULBS AND MAKING THE
2917,AH UMM,M
2918,IT WOULD BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY WILL,THEY WERE TO BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT I AND ELECTRICY WON'T
2919,ELECTRICITY BECAUSE ELECTRICITY IS A BLUE DOTS FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE WHILE THROUGH THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHEN THE WIRE ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S THE UNTIL LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHERS,LECTRICITY ECAUSE ELECTRICITI'S A BLUE DOT GOING THROUGH THE DECEL AND THE ONE OF THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND WHEN O THE WIRES ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND INTURN TO LIHTBOLD BACK TO THE OTHER
2920,JUST IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS ACTUALLY STAYING LIKE ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS A NOT REALLY AND KEEPS GOING OFF AND YOU HAVE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE BULB AND STUFF LIKE,IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE A THAT ONE'S ACTUALLY STAYING LIT ON DETAL ONE AND THAT ONE IS LIKE NOT REALLY IT KEEPS GOING OFF AN THEN YOU HAVE TO LIKE RE DOLIGHT BALB AND STUFF LIKE
2921,AH WELL RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAD THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE,AM WHERIGHT NOW THE PITCHERE HAS THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE BOTH OFTHE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE
2922,ONE D CELL AND IT'S NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL,O ON ON DE CEL I SNO THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D SEL TOO AM BUT THE TWO BATTERIES TA LIHT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN DE SELL
2923,IT WON'T GLOW,IT WON'T GL
2924,THE CIRCUITS ABOUT A FALSE CIRCUIT,A CIRCUITS ABOUT A FALSE SIC

2935,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN I REPEAT THAT
2936,HI MORNIE,BY RONI
2937,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THERE IS NOTHING THERE IS NO WIRE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE IS ONLY WIRE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH LECTRICITY IN THE THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO WIRES TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S ONLY WIRES TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE
2938,THERE ARE LIKE BULBS ARE GLOW,THO LIKE BOB'S HARGL

3674,AND YEAH THAT WHAT I THINK THAT THEY DO WITH THEM MMM HMM,AND YE THAT'S WAT I THINK WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM
3675,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED AND WITH THE MAGNETS FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL,CAUSE WE WE LEARNED WITH THE MAGNETS THAT FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL
3676,MMM HMM THEN ALSO YOU COULD USE IT AT A JUNKYARD TO MOVE STUFF AROUND,UHU THEN 'LSO YOU COULD USEIN A JUNKYARD TO MOVE STUFF AROUND
3677,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACES THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT'D BE PRETTY BAD,YOU COULD JUS USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACETHINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THAN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT E PRETTY BAD
3678,YEP MMM HMM,UP

3701,AND,AND
3702,AS I SAID I THINK IT'S UM AS A BY IT'S CLOSER TO THE THE RIVET,AS I SAID I THINK IT'S UM AS THE CLOSE IT'S CLOSER TO THE OH GET RID OF IT
3703,WHAT UM,A
3704,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNET YOU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MMM HMM UH HUH,WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH THE MAGNETE YOU WOULD JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU'D HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR HA
3705,THE TO THE RIVET N AND WOULD,THAT TO THE RIVET AN AN WUT
3706,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETISM WELL THE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IT CAN AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET,THOUGH I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WORLD WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT M TE OTHAT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNT AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETTHE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IAS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO ID BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET
3707,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP WELL PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL AM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP  PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM
3708,THEN WHAT ELSE COULD YOU USE IT UM,THEN SCULD HE USE IT OM
3709,UM WELL,AM WO
3710,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S ALL WELL IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICIS AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAG WELL I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT YEAH,THE RIVER IT'S UM IT'S ABOLT SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRISES AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAGBO I'D SAY WASHERS AHA SO A YE
3711,WORKS BETTER MMM HMM,WORKS BETTER UHU
3712,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVE IT MORE ENERGY ES CAUSE IT'S CLOSER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT'D BE UH HUH,UM ET SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY CAUSE IT'S CLOSER DOES IT HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE RAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTRO MAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE I'D E
3713,THEY HAVE THE METAL INSIDE OF THEM THAT TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY I THINK AND THEN THE RIVET ACTS AS A,THEY HAVE THE METAL INSIDE OF THEM THAT TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY I THINK AND THEN THE RIVID ACTS AS A
3714,I LIKE PICKING UP THINGS,OT PICKING UP THINGS
3715,NO MMM HMM,NO FARATS AYO

3721,MMM HMM AND THAT MAGNET WAS JUST PICKING IT UP WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY OR BATTERIES OR WIRES,AN THAT MAGNANT WAS JUST PICKING IT UP WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY OR BATTERIES OR WIRES
3722,NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN JUST UH HUH,NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN JUST AHA
3723,MAYBE THE WIRES MAKE IT UM MAGNETISM SO MAKE IT LIKE A MAGNET SO IT CAN PICK UP THOSE WASHERS,MAYBE THE WIRES MAKE AM MAGNETISM SOME MAKE IT LIKE A MAGNET SO I CAN PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
3724,UM I HAVE NO CLUE,M I'VE NO CLUE
3725,UH HUH YEP,AHU AASES ME UP
3726,YEAH BEFORE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PICK ANYTHING UP,A BEFORE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END IN A WOODEN POKE ANYTHING UP
3727,WE TRIED TO SEE DID IT MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE H HOW DOES IT DO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE,WE TRIED TO SEE DIDN'T MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE HODOES IT IMATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE
3728,WE PICKED UP MORE WASHERS MMM HMM,WE PICKED UP MORE WASHERS
3729,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY MMM HMM,LWE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE THE ELECTRIELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY
3730,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD'VE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAG UM WELL A ELECTRICITY SO UM,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD HAVE EITHE EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAUMMOELECTRICITY SO UM
3731,GOT STRONGER UH HUH,THE STRONGER AHA
3732,POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL,SITIVE SITE OF THE DISA
3733,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIPE ULP TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
3734,THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BOLT
3735,POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE,POSITITIVE AND NEGATIVE
3736,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IS NOT LIGHTING UP
3737,THE CAN THE CON WHAT'S THAT,DOCIN DE CAN WAS THAT
3738,YES,S
3739,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A M NOT MAG A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT UP,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON AMNOT MA A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRIED TO MAKE A LIGHTBOL UM LIGHT UP
3740,UM SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS,SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS
3741,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE
3742,WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL AND ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB,WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE DCELIN ATTACHIT TO THE LIGHT BALB
3743,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCKED MY FINGER,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I TOUCHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCK MY FINGER
3744,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THTHE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT

3857,UM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME,AN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS I ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
3858,UM WELL THIS KIND OF CONNECTS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU CAN DO TO SHOWS ALL THE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT JUST LIKE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR LIKE THE SLOPE LIKE RIGHT HERE,SO THIS IS THIS KIND THIS ISS EXACTLY LIKE OUR PLANE SEP WE HAVEN'T CHAT WE I THINK WE MIGHT CHANGE THE UM
3859,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE
3860,UM YOU,M YOU
3861,WELL WE FIGURED OUT IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT,WELL WE FIGURED I TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE WAYG BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS S HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METRS SO THIS GRAF DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT
3862,UM THE RUBBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES GETS IT TO MOVE,AM THE RUBBER BAND IT' IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KINDOF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S UST WHAT MAKES SKETZA TO MOVE
3863,THE ANGLE OF THE STRING BUT YEAH,ANGLE STRING BUT YE
3864,FOUR METERS SORRY I MEAN IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS,FOUR METERS SORRY I MIT LOOKS  AS EN FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINES
3865,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,OMI LOOKS LIKE IS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR THE PLAINE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINES AND YE
3866,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,A B WE'RE JUST TRAING TO JUST CINETO MAKE A COOL CONCRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER WITH A RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GOINGTO LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE ECAUSE UM YHAVE THE PROPELLER POWERN AND THEN WERE GOIN T TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT EFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER ECLIPS AND YE
3867,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERS  THAT' THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST GIND TO SIT THERE
3868,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USED TO BUILD IT THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
3869,S SO,SO
3870,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THETHE FIGHT FLIGHTLINE LOKS LIKE ITS GOING UP WORD AND YA LOOK WL LOOKS LIKE ITS TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YA
3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE O THIS ARRALL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE O PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINES SO
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NED SOMEWE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE WILL LIKE STAY ON SAIT THE WIRE GARG WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YA N TEN WE JUST KIND O HAVE PAP UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
3873,HI,HI
3874,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT INT ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S IT YOU CAN DECIDE WUT OHOW FAST YOU WANTED TO GO HOW FAR ROSROLA DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE
3875,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,MWELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE AN HALFWAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AND AM THI  WELL IT ERN IT LOOKS HERE THAT THIS GRAFF WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE I SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR US TO GO M SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERED ONLY SAYS TWENTY TWO WINES FOR TWO METERS SO HA'D BE INCORRECT AND UM Y
3876,W WELL WE HAVE A S WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN IN HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THIS S PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND THE PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE,WELL WE HAVE US WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN I'M HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEW WE JUST HAVE THES PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND AND A PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECT THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU CJUST MAKE THIS PLAIN
3877,UM ONE THING THAT AFFECT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAN AFFECT IT IS THE TYPE OF STRING IN OUR CASE WE'RE DOING FISHING WIRE BUT T IT COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING OR UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS AND THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS,ONE THING THOWIT AFFECT IT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT IC AFFECTED IS THE TYPE OF STRING AN ARCHIST RODINT FISHING WIRE BUT YOU COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING THERE ARE A MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS IN THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS
3878,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ANGLED LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CL IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF'S INGLE LEGS STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE NDIF YOU IF YOU NIF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOUL GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT
3879,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS UP WE WANT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE WO A YARD AND A HALF,WE WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS IF WE WABUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE A YARD AND A HALF
3880,UM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND,E NEED T THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINES WE MAKE AND WE NED A CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND
3881,WELL THE THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE ON THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER,WELL THTHE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GOING TO FLY AS FAR BCAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE OT THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER
3882,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAKE AIRPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAG AIROPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE
3883,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU'LL YOU COULD CHANGE,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USED FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR A SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOUYOU COULD CHANGE

3888,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED A MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIK IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED A CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEEM LIKE CHANGED THE WINES OR SO IT'S JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS
3889,WHAT,WHAT
3890,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLAIN AND YOU SAW A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
3891,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING,A MATIC RULER OR SOMETHING
3892,YEAH YEAH THAT'S,YA YA THAT S WAT
3893,HI,I MER
3894,THERE'S ONE HUNDRED,IIS ONE HUNDRED
3895,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F N,THEN YE SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL IN
3896,YEAH,YE
3897,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS,WE GOT UP WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQL STRAWS
3898,A RULER YEAH,O A RULER MURMERED THE METRIC STINKLY YA GR
3899,Y LIKE THIS,BUE LIKE THIS
3900,YES YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY,YES SATEY YE  E MO THOS ME THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY
3901,YEAH,Y
3902,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING
3903,BECAUSE I WAS OUR S THE STRAWS ON OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE'S SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT,BECAUSE OR  OR STHE STRAWS AT OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLES SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT
3904,YEAH,YES
3905,WE LEARNED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM CAN,WE LEARN THAT ELECTRIC SYSTEM CAN
3906,IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THE,IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THE
3907,YEAH,YES
3908,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL,LIKEE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL
3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SOT WES A MECTIC SYSSTEM TO CONTACT WITH A THER COUNTRIES
