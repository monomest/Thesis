1,OKAY,OKAY
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THEY WOERED JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH
4,YEAH,YEAH
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANNA JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASSI WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,UM PROBOTELY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID  I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S SAW  THAT WOULD MAKE AT DIFFERENTS I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YEAH A LITTLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO I DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORISONTOL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEACHER AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROT ON ONE TIME IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIRE LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODYWE JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM UM RLIKE EXACTLY W THE WAY OUR DESK WHERE IT OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND THEN UM THEN YI WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY UH EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,UM YEAH WE JST DID GRAPHING TO YESTERDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY
14,MATH,MAATH
15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,OKAY
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO   ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBER STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THENS IT GOT SMALLERAND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE  THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED
19,OKAY,OKAY
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM UP STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UH FLIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE IS FORCE I'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
21,YEAH,YEAH
22,OKAY,OKAY
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SYSTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT NO WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM END SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP IN A PENNY AND YOU WOULD TOUCH THE SSTRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I  I I DIDN'T TELHER THIS BUT THE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE ST THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS THIN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER O
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,OKAY YES WE'VE DON PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG THEM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BUTBE UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO IT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING THE EXPERIMEN IT UNTILL EVERY ONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINSCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,OKAY
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'TT DONE THAT YET
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRIZS PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FORTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUSTT WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS IT'S
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE WA WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHET NUMBER IT WENT TO WHAT HOW HOIHT IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WEN'T LIKE THIS  LIKE THAT SORT OF SO I WENT UP INSTEAD UP DOWN
34,UM WE,UM WE
35,WE WERE USING,WE WERE USING
36,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SHE WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF
37,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP
38,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WE'RE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSHED DOWN THE UM THE LONCHER THING AND THEN THE UM LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWNAND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
39,YEAH,YEAH
40,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WELL  WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIRES AND THEN FLIPPERS
42,YEAH,YEAH
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO LHOT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MODOR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE
44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT  BUT THEN MISS MOTRO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS OUT COME OUT OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY T NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,MM HMM YEAH AND THEN AFT WELL THEN WE TESTE IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SM PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF TTWO
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,WELL M THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEEAT THE FOUR CAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFOURE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIF TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHAT WE ADDED ALL THOSE TOGETHER ON E CALCULATER AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS A RESULT AND YEAH
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WELL WE ALL CAME UP WITH THER VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS TIN AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SOR IT AVE THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHEWSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH WHON THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE XIS I IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER TH WHERE THEY MEAT AND WE WALKED AND LET SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SICKS AND SO I WENT TO SICX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WA  AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAPH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STEL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS IND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,UH  THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINE BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEET OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL THAT
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,M HM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SICKS WAS ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED STICKS FIRST AND THEN WE WENT W KEPT GOING OUT UNTILL TWO SO SICK IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WERD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHEE CHOSED TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVESS ANOTHER BUL IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVUS TRIED AND YE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY INTO SICK AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE
63,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO
64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,THAT WAS FURTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IFIT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS OR THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELLE THER POWER FOR IT THROUGH I GUESS
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HAV THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THEN MORES THE MORE SPINS OUH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DIDN'T WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK TOTH WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALF WAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE JUST DISGUESSED WHAT NUMBERH
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLY IT AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIENCE WENT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE ENTO THE CHAIRE AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST END TO USS CAUSE IT THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE WHICHTWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW HOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO PE E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO SP
71,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL WEL KNOW E REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWNOD THAT WOULD BE COOL
72,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETE FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOUR METERS,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETER FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOURT
73,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YEAH ACTU LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE JUST HID ID IT WAS TOWO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT AF LIKE MORE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST JUSSIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY O W
74,YEAH,YEAH
75,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROKADNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WERE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS  WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FORTY SPINS LIKE TIS I REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
76,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
77,YEAH,YEAH
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S ALL LIKE REALLY COOLD TO SEE THEM FLY THUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BCAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT'S SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMEN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO THE SEE AND THIS WOMEN WAS DOING A FRONT HAND SPERING OFF THE T WAS HASD DOING A VALT AND I DO AL LIKE I TAKE JMASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOW
79,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS
80,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN AS LIKE SO YOU GO AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEEATS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR PIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY TTESTED IT LIKE ONECE
81,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIRE WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROP IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PART IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROCKID NESS SO  MAYBE THE CHAIRES WOERE CROKIED

124,YEAH,YEAH
125,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID  FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
126,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY UM IT WAS JU THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY UM HIT WAS JUT THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW
127,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,OH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEY'RE SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THEN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH IT CAN'T GET IN
128,NO,NOO
129,OH YOU CAN HAVE IT,OH YOU CAN HAVE IT

134,LIKE PROBABLY,LIKE PROBABLY
135,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOUGH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL AND LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THO BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHE WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELLD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SHARE
136,WE PUT EM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN THEY WERE OUR PASSENGERS,WE PUT THEM IN WATER AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN THEY WERE OUR PASSENGERS
137,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE,IT'S TELLING ME WHAT WE GOT LIKE
138,YEAH,YEAH
139,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN AND WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S E N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN WE'D PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE US US E EN AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABYY
140,YEAH,YEAH
141,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PR YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS IN MEASURING IN SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY IND WELL WE P YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY IN THEIR DIRECTIONS
142,AND THEN,AND THEN WATCHING
143,YEAH,YEAH
144,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE BOATS WE SORALY MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACTUALLY WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN SSUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO AH GRADULATED SIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
145,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH O OKAY THAT OKAY I THAUT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING OS SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN N LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO AFFECT THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME S SO WE  MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STEEL IT CAN'T BE LIKE RUFF WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE RUFF WATERS TENT END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
146,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING
147,YEAH,YEAH
148,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DID THIS WAS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PRUB A UH WE DIDN'T YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS
149,YEAH,YEAH
150,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKE TO CALY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THAT WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO
151,BOATS I THINK WHAT LI UM,BOATS I THINK WHAT LIKE UM
152,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,YEAH YEAH WE DID WE I SORT AF FORGET CAUSE WE TALKE ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT IT WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOTIN THINGA
153,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME,BUT THEY'RE NOTHE SAME
154,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER VOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROATE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THEYRE WAS A HUGE RAIN OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
155,YEAH,YEAH
156,UM YEAH,UM YEAH
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE SAM THE OR HOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW W HOW WE COULD GET AND OUT COME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUT COMAND  GET FUN FINDI IN  A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN' FOR TO THE PENNIES AND LIKE PIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPED INTO THE BOTTOM AN WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY AND IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATTER CAME IT SO
160,YEAH,YEAH
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YEAH IT BECAUSE DO YOU WANT TO HAE F FIND WEU WANT NA HAVE A EXPLINATION FOR OUR EXPERIENMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME END SO LIKE SO WHEN YOUUD DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANT NTO KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO  AN THE ENDS  LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE'R OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A UM ALL IN ALL UM MOTE UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES
162,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME S SHES OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD THE  LESS NO  LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS SL ID LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES DIDN'T I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM
163,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
164,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE SATURATED SOLUTION SOMETHING LIKE THAT NO THE START OVER,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TWO LIFT UP THE THE CITRIC SOMETHING LIKE NO THE STARTLE

1166,TEN OR MAYBE MORE YEAH,KIND O MAYBE WORKING
1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,EASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE MOE OF BATTERIES LIKE LIKE THEY'RE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND HUNDRED VENS IT PICKED UP THEI D WASHERS BCAUSE IT HAD TWO BATTERI
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,WWHEN YOU LLCREASE MORE F THE LIGTSIT HAS MORE THERES TAN FOR
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCE
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT  IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUT IT DOESN'T
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINUSED THE LINE TO SEVEN  ME TO TURN ONES I UDKNWBEFORE ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW IT JUST PICKED UP FIVE
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT I DISCOVEREDS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAPPING  MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UMA MORE A WASHER STICK TO IT
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,THT'S ATTACHED TO THIRTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN IT PUT A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS B BEFORE IT I ONLY PICKED UPNLY PICKED UP TOM WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDENG UP A FIVE MORE
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,ININCREASE ONE I DO THAT AND PICKS UP TOLOWERE CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WHEN PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS IT AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,WHAT IT RELATES IS
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'IS N SUPPOSE TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE ICLOSED ER TO EVERYTHING
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE VERSE ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES  GOES UP TO
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,EE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOUE WANTAN NO MAKE YOUR ELECTROMAGTVE TROER SIDD MORE BATTERIES FACING U POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THE MORE  LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING I THE STRENGTH IS IT'S  GETTING  MORE FORCE INTO IT
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,WHAUT O ST AN A BOUT BOUT THE GRAPH IS NUMBERS
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WHA HAPPEN TO AN THE OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BATTERY
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A BASING WATER AND I CASING WATER
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING THROUGH I A LIGHT BULB  BMHINGT
1189,NO,I EAVE LOTS
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT ISN'  ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE A S TURNED AROUND I TE A HAV TO HAVE A MEGATIVE AND TE POSITVEPOSITVE SI TOUCHING EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO  MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
1191,UM IT WILL <unk> IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,ITLL ITLL THE LIGHT BULB SHON  BRIGHT AND BRR EARTH TO LIGHT TO THE LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS <unk> RIGHT,IT' DIFFERENT BECAUSE MAY BE JUST HAVE ONE THEELECTRICITY WIL RIG OUT AND THES SERTING KINS O DIFFERENT BTHAT AN INSIDE IT SHINES B
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,IT'S GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES US A CIRCUIT IS WHE WHEN THE WISE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CASING WHERE AND THE BASING WIR
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,TBOTH WIRES  OF THE REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEY'LL BE EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I OBSERVE IS WHEN YOU  JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TO LIGHT BULBS ITLL FL BE DEULL AND A SHIBRIGHT BUT IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES ITLL MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS SHINE BRIGHTER
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE THE LIGHT BULB
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE  ELECTRICITY  GOES THROUGH
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONES  PATHWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING N SIENCE IS LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS LITLE IT WILL SHI LOWER AND LOWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT TA BATTERY WITH  BATTERY YOU PUT THE
1203,OKAY,GREAT
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT <unk>,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT OR THE LIGHT WL BE
1205,FINISH,FINISHED
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,LL CEN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,CONNECT HE PASSIG ISIAKE SPOJECTTT
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPENE IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT WHAT BOTH EF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A BASING WIR AND ON A CASN I
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,WHEN WE ADD MARE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ALSO THE LIGHT IS CLEAR BECAUSE F FOR THE
1211,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO

1217,CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS,AT CHANGE THE SAME CRS THE FILTER
1218,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,IT'S NO USE TO THE COLOR BCAUSE IT'S IS GREEN LARME AND IT'S JUST BIGREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
1219,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,IT'S I THE PRESM IS TINGIN IT COLORS
1220,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,WOULD LO HOW THE REFLECTION THAT THE COMERA
1221,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR TO  PERSON
1222,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S A IM BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
1223,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BASHING OFF OF OBJECTSRG OTH THE COLOR BLUE
1224,SEVEN SIX,SEVEN SIX
1225,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,BUT HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THSE KIND OF COLORS LIKE A TOR VIALAT TO PUR TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED
1226,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,THE LIGHT IS REFLEX N OLLYU OL

1238,SIX COLOR,SIX COLR
1239,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COLORS REFLECTED OFF AND IT ANGES ITS COLOR
1240,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SOLAR DS AND CIRCUITS ANDTHEISM
1241,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIXE UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT B WEN THE CAR IT'S WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE
1242,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT,THEY ALL HA LIGHT
1243,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,ONONE SPACER T WASHERS TO BREAK IT
1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,BY IT FORCE
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FORCE WAS THE STRONG ENOUGH
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,WHAT IT DOES'MIX THE FIRST A WEEAKER
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS UNDER THE PAPER PAPER CLIP ISOM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUNT
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS S YO'RE NE SIPOLSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS MA COMOTO CONNECT
1249,THE MAGNET <unk> THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNETTHE MAGNET IS ON S UND LIK STACK AND EN YOU'RE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PICALIC AS W MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN I JUST IDED WHEN  WASHED  IT BROKE GETS BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE HE SPEACES MADE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I OBSARVE HAPPENING IS LIKE N TIM  PRESSING THE WASHERS GOING
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,T EVUBR ADD ONE SPACER BREAKS ITTOFALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY  TO STICK ON
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,WHATER DOES IT MAKES TE AMET MAKES THE AOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS AND OOTHER CUPS F SEE HOW MANY  WASHERS AT BREAK A THE MAGNETS FALL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE GO I THE MAGNETTOSME OF THE AETALLY IS FORCE TO
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART F THE FIRSET CFORCE CHLS A WEAKER BECAUSE THEREIS THE OTHER MAGNETS MAGNETISM AND FORCE OF THE ORE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAGS T WEAKER
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,THEY'RE SPIGTING APART
1260,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT  GO UP TO THE IT BROKENFALL
1261,MAGNETISM,MAGNETTISM
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WHIT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN IT PRES SPEACERS WHEN IT ADD THEMTUB MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNETS ARE STILL TOUCHING EACH OTHER
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,IT GOES BIGGER THANE IT GOES SMALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES T MIX THE FORCE KIND OF BEAKERD E CARE WER ARE INSTIDAR BEING STRONGER AND USUALLY THE FORCE I
1265,I NEEDED THREE,I NEED IT THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,NOTICE IS WHEN IT'SLESS THAN ONE'S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S SEFERING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCEBOING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL AND  I MEAN THAT KIND OF U THE KIND OF U MAGNET IN THEM THAT'S ALL I HAVE
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THIS VAL ONSE WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK INTO A PAPER CLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF IT
1269,<unk> THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,THNAS ATN LIKE A
1270,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL WITH THE THIN ONE IT S LIKE  ONE I GUESS LERE A ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKIN O T  OO AND THEN I START IN THIS AND THEN IT'S GOING LIKE THAT AND LIT KIND OF LIKE MAGNETI
1271,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING O IT THE THICK PECEOF PEAPLE IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK I AND THING N IT COULD BECAUSE IT' S
1272,BUT THE DIFFERENT <unk> PUSH BACK,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AN WH THEY PUSHED BACK
1273,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNET MAKES IT THROUGH AND THEN IT JUST REALLY REALLY REALLY KEYS,IT RELATES TO MAGNETISM BY FORCE OF THE MAGNETI MIX U THROUGH WHEN I JUST REALLY REALLY DOWN WITH TOS
1274,UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST,WELL IT IS UP THAT THAT WITH THA N THINGS JU
1275,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT  HOW I KET THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO ITO WELL STRONG THAT IT COULD GO THROUGH A NAIL IND ORDER TO C HOLD A PAPER CLIP
1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,WHAT I CAN SEE ABOUT THAT IS IT'S T ANY TURM E MAGNETS ON IT IIT REACTS LIKE
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISN' IT ACTING LIKE A MA U LIKE  WIE YOU CAL WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY AN CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH AND STILL MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND REACTS LIKE A METAL
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,HEN IT'S TO MAGNET ON ITSTICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN ITS NOT IT CAN NOT STICK TO THE PAPER CLP
1279,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT,WHAT I  ASISL
1280,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
1281,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT'S BECAUSE THEIRE MAGNETISM CAN NOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH ANY BOTERGRAPH TE PAPER CLIP IT THAT'S F
1282,GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME,GOING ON WHERE I JUST SEE THE SAMETHING YOUSRIN YU LAST TNIMET
1283,UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP,ORERE YOU SPING M BECAUSE A SE S THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THE NAIL N THE PAPERCLIP
1284,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S,WHAT PEN IS IT STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT' CONNECTING TO PAPER I
1285,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE
1286,ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO,ONCE  THE MAGNET ROP ATHER TAPLE AND THEN HEMNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET S CONNECTING IT AND HOLD
1287,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE FORCE A STUFF GO THROUGH WHAT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WERE SO LIKE IS SO STRONG,WHAT S HAPPENING IS THE FORCE CAUS THE GO THROUGH WOOD BECAUSE THE MAGNETFORCE IS SO LIKE IT SO STRONG
1288,REPEAT THAT,REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE
1289,THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,THE MAGNET IS WEMERE FROM THE NAIL AND THROUGH THE NAIL USES ITS MAGNETIS
1290,LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER CLIP<unk>,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A MET AND A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
1291,LEARNNG ABOUT MAGNETISM,NOT GREAT
1292,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CANP CAN NOT REPELL EACH OTHER
1293,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET AND THE NAIL AND IT'S FORE KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
1294,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD <unk> PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY,UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD UM PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
1295,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM,I THINK WHAT IS DRING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM
1296,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT,WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETTISM FORCES OFF ND BECAUS ITS A MAGNET IS MAKING ITT
1297,THE <unk> FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF,THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER AN OTDOR MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
1298,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET,IT CAN'T BECAUSE M THE MAGNETATM FOR
1299,THE LIGHT BULBS ALL OF THEIR ELECTRICITY AND,LIGHT BULBS ARE ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND
1300,OKAY,OKAY
1301,A D CELL BATTERIES AND,A D CELL BATTERYS OF
1302,WELL A HELPS LIGHTED UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT ENERGY LOOK UP,WELL IT HELPS LIGHTET UP WHEN THE WIRES TO CONNECT THE ENERGY TO GO
1303,BUT I SEE THIS PICTURE IS NOT SO THAT ELECTRICITY GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS LOTS OF  ELECTRICITY GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND ROUND LIK TE LIGHT BULB
1304,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,I THINK DIFFRENT BOTH CONNECT TO THE WISE ARE THE BASEBULB I W REALLY IGHT BECAUSE THELASTIC IS OLDING
1305,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERIES WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB,THEY ARE THE D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BL
1306,BUT I NOTICE IS SOME IMPORTANT THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT,WHAT I NOWTICE IS CERTAIN PARTS THERE ARE WIRES CONNECTD
1307,THE ELECTRICITY FLOW,THE ELECTRICITY
1308,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,THE DIRECTION TE FLOW WHEN IT  THE SWITCH THE D CELL I T CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TE OTHER DIRECTION
1309,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING ADD OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1310,WITH THE AT THE SAME WIRE AND YOU,S BECAUSE IT UT WORK BECAUSE IT'S BOTH AT THE SAME WIRE AND I NT
1311,WHEN THE WHATEVER SIDE YOU JUST SWITCH IT IS SO WORK THE SAME WAY,WHEN IT WHATEVER  SUND YOU JUST SWITCH IT TO IT STILL WORKS THE SAME WA
1312,DOESN'T THE CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE THE ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY,WHAT A WIRE DOESIN'T A CIRCUIT IS HELPS MAKE T ENERGY OR SOURCE TO GO THROUGH THE BATTERY
1313,IF ONE WIRE IS HEATING THROUGH CASING WIRE WANT TO HEATING THROUGH THE BASE WIRE,WHAT ONE WIRE IS HITTING THROUGH THE PECE OF WIRE ONE IS FITING TO THE BASE WIRE
1314,WIRES IN IT CIRCUIT CARRY,WIRES IN A CIRCUIT CARRY
1315,OKAY BUT,OKAY BYE
1316,THE COMPONENT NEED TO BE RIGHT,THE CPHONIA NEE TO BE
1317,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY IF BATTERY GIVING IT IT'S,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE BATTERY GIVING IT ITS ENERGY TO PUSH IR BT
1318,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,WHAT I NOTICED THAT I DID'T GIT THE LIGHT BULB TLIGHT T IN ORDER TO LIGHT UP THE B WIT TEENERGY
1319,WHERE I AM NOT AND IT'S GOING THROUGH BONDS BOTH WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT THE SET UP S IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH L WIRS INTO THE LIGHT BLB
1320,WHERE IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE D CELL <unk> WIRES,WHERE THE ELECTRICITY GROWS  THE D CELL IS TWIRES
1321,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW THAT IS GOT,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND NOW BATTERIES GON
1322,ELECTRICITY,THE BLUE DOTS S ANELECTRICITY
1323,WITH THAT MEANS ME AS A CIRCUIT GOING ROUNDED NOT LIKE WITH THE ELECTRICITY,WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A CIRCUIT GOING AROUND AND AROUND TE LIKE IT WITH THE ELECTRICITY
1324,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE UM
1325,THIS DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1326,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS,A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER BY RECEIVING ALL THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY OR CIRCUITS
1327,WHEN YOU PUT THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING TO,WHEN YOU FLIPP THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING P
1328,ON THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH,ALL THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUG
1329,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATTERY HELPS WITH THE WIRE  AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP LIGHT ET ON AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
1330,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S IMPORTANT SO THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK CO GO THROUGH THE FRUN BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET  TO GET THE MAGNET
1331,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP,THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
1332,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,TWI THE RIOVEMENT THROUGH THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FROM BECAUSE THAT'S THE  ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY COOK OUP THE
1333,THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,ITCS TO MAGNET AN C ON PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S I OR ST
1334,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITY THROWS GOES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE C I CONNECTO  IALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND THE I GOES THROUGH THPOSITIVE SIDE THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
1335,WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT,WE LEARNED ABOUT W  OENITAN CLSE I GET AFFECTED AND I KNOW
1336,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BECAUSE IT IRON OR STEEL TO THE MAGNEE TO SUBMIT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND NONTO IT TO MAKE IT TO GET THE MAGNETIC WARCE
1337,UM THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTIL THE WIRE IS UM CLOSED,THE WASHERS WON'T STICK TO IT UNTILL THE UAER IS COE
1338,SMALL,AS
1339,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WELL THE CIRCUIT OF  SPITCH AT LEAST  SOMETHING HAS TO BE PLUGED  OF A MAGNEGTET FOUR CELL  ELECTRICITY C AV CE TH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE
1340,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,WSER HAPPEN THAT THE RIVER IND THE WIRES S IT HAS TO AT LEAST CONNECT SOME WA OR AT LEAST DO SOMETHING
1341,A RIVET,A RIVET
1342,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WELL WHEN IT'S OPENCIRCUIT THE WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THTHE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCU IT STICKS
1343,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT HAS BECAUSE THE WIREFTHE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT UM TO THE SWITCH AND THEN 'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIV IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE
1344,SCIENCE,CIENCE
1345,WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS IN,WHAT THOT RELATES TO SWITCH S IAND
1346,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,WHEN T HAS  CLOSED CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO WHA CONNECTE WITH THE WASHERSAND THE WASHERS LL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN BL
1347,THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MAGNEGTIC FORCE
1348,IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE,IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
1349,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT,CLEAU REPEAT THAT
1350,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,IS WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE TO SM IT CONNECT TO IT THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT IT HAS NO COMPELLE IT TO THE WIRE O G
1351,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF THE WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S SWITCHED IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF WITH THE THING WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD  NOTHING STICKS TO IT BT WHEN IT'S FID IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING

1911,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,UH WELL UM WE 'RE CHOESING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MI S MLL JO BROUGHT IN LIKE MANY PANS AND WE'RE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER
1912,A SANDWICH,A SAND WHICH
1913,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MIKRP BRIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING TH
1914,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE  H AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP  UH HUM AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOURE HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN EN THE ONE IT WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TWO SIX IT'S FULL YEAH THA
1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL THE OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON AURE  JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORDING AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THEMIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AND THE F FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TIE TANYOU KNOW IN THE TI TANIC THAT THER LIFE BOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UM MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUSBOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUW SHIP
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNY IS JUST TALOVOSLY WE P WE TRIE TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN TIT GO TO THE SIDE
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,FEL LIKE A SUPER STARIK I ALREADY KNEW THAT NOINFINING
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS  LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASH PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
1922,YEAH,YEAH
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,UM WELL OUR TO MENETS I DON'T PERTICULARLY KNOW HIT'S NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIINING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHITH THE MASS WHATH THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW LIGHT WILL FLOAT OR HOW  IT WILL SINK
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POURE THAT OUT IND OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY USE IN THREE THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AN THREE
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW WE PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MEADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE TOOCKED THE COFFE CUP OR A CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WENTED TO AND THEN OUR PARNER AND ICE U THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL AT UH ONE SIDE IT WAS GOIN NO SINK EVEN FASTER SO
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT
1927,THE HEIGHT,THE HEIGHT
1928,MAYBE,MAYBE
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFE COAP BOAT CAN HOLD
1930,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE,WELL I  I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE
1931,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS
1932,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CROUG SBOAT MAY BE LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TARRAB IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHERS OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNES THAT A GAS R I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE I COULD JELLI AN TIMES BIGGER SO
1933,YEAH,YEAH
1934,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE UM WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARTER GUNE SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARTER GUNE IT WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO T WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE SE DOWN HE A DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL P AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TOUB

2013,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WE YES WE WELL UM MY TEACHER JUST ONCE A STO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED AT THE EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GOS AS GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT
2014,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE UM OURE FLUP STICK IS THE POPSICLE STICK AND THERE SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTILL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
2015,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE WOULD YOU'L GETNA MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS TSO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE
2016,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,UM LIKE HOW TO WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SICK CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IN IN AS FAR AS WE WU WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPULLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY SPUNNING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK I IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW HI READY SAY THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO  UM UH
2017,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,UH UH  THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM THE UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WHENT ABOUVH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS A LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDOF TAPE MEASURING TAPE
2018,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND UM SO WE UM O OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FAR THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR IT OUT IT IS NOT THAT WA UT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN GETS THAT UH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT
2019,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN
2020,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU JU ECIDED HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE CHEELD TO SEES CALCULATERS SO AFTER THE DESCIMAL ON THE CALCULATER THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO W'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS
2021,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS  I AT WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN O BID BUTY THIS AFTERD
2022,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK A SMALL ALUMINUM FOILBALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UUM UM BOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO WAS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGED THE VARIABLE IF WE USED OUR FINGER SO WE USED HA POPSTICLE STICK
2023,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOUR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOUR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID 'T FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS
2024,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLUPED IT IN THE PERSON HO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEYWOULD GO I CLOSE TO THE TAPE SO WD SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE
2025,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UMLUMINUMVUL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE 'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW IH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OURE LIKE GUESS SO

2480,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TILL IT STARTS GOING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICCTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTILL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GON FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY IT WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERYT WILL BURN OUT
2481,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT,WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
2482,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORDE INTO THE MINUS SIDE AN MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT
2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BULL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TOO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE IN
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MOD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS AN VERY IMPORTANT ROLL BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,IT BEGANS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND ITS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXE TOGETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BULL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,ITS CALLED WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,OKAY GOOD
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIKE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORT IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEY'RE UNING PILE INSTEAD OF EN ONE ALL TOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S A SOLUTION
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT IT'S PURPOS IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING SE  IT'AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND U WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS AND STUFF AND THAT ANDYA

2903,MORNIE CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE <unk>,MARNIE CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
2904,WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE MAINLY ELECTRICITY THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO LIGHT BULB ONE TO LIGHT BULB TWO THEY GOING BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES IT GOES AGAIN OUT TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE,WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE MAINLY ELECTRICITY THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO TE LIGHT BULB ONE TO THELIGHT BULB TOO THEN GOING BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES AND THEN IT GOES AGAIN OUT THROGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE
2905,IT'S SOME,IT'S SO
2906,AH,I
2907,I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING IF VARIOUS THEN FROM ONE PLATE ONE NEITHER ONE PALATE TOWARDS AND LIKE THAT I HAVE NO I DON'T REMEMBER IT SHOWS ON FROM TWENTY ONE,I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING IF IT WAS ONE FROM ONE POINT ONE OR ONE PUT TWO OR SOMETHIN LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW  II DON'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE F FROM TWO POINT ONE
2908,WE'VE TWO YOU CAN'T ONLY HAVE TWO BATTERIES OR LIGHT BULBS IN A CIRCUIT,WENWE HAVE T YOU CAN ONLY HAVE TWOB BATTERIES OR LIGHT BULBS IN A CIRCUIT
2909,CLOSE CIRCUITS OPEN THE CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS,CLOSED CIRCUITS OPEN CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS AND A COMPLETE CIRU
2910,AH AN OPEN CIRCUIT,A OAN OPEN CIRCUIT
2911,SO YEAH SO CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,SCAN YOU REPEAT THAT
2912,I DON'T,I DON'T
2913,WELL THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIKE BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING EACH OF LIKE BULB TWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK TO LIKE BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK ITS TO THE A POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOESN'T AGAIN,WELL THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING INTO H LIGHT BULB TOWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK THROUGH  LIGHT BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK INTO THE A POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOES TA AGAIN
2914,SO MORNIE,T'S UPM
2915,I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT,I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUI
2916,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDES TOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE WIRES GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKE INTO,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE S STOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDE SIDE AND A WIRE'S GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE NONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKING THE
2917,AH UMM,UM
2918,IT WOULD BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY WILL,THEY WORE TO BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT IT ANDELECTRICITY WON'T
2919,ELECTRICITY BECAUSE ELECTRICITY IS A BLUE DOTS FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE WHILE THROUGH THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHEN THE WIRE ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S THE UNTIL LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHERS,ELECTRICITY CAUSE ELECTRICITY'S A BLUE DOT GOING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE ONE OF THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHEN OF THE WIRES ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S GING S LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHER
2920,JUST IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS ACTUALLY STAYING LIKE ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS A NOT REALLY AND KEEPS GOING OFF AND YOU HAVE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE BULB AND STUFF LIKE,IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE'S ACTUALLY STAYING LIT ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS LIKE NOT REALLY IT IT KEEPS GOING OFF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LIKE R E LIGHT BULB AND STUFF LIKE
2921,AH WELL RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAD THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE,WE RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAS THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WE WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE
2922,ONE D CELL AND IT'S NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL,NONE D CELL I NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL
2923,IT WON'T GLOW,IT WON'T GLOW
2924,THE CIRCUITS ABOUT A FALSE CIRCUIT,A CIRCUIT'S ABOUT A FULL CIRCUI
2925,ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVES THOSE CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY WHICH IS CIRCUIT WIRE,ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVES E CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY MAKES AS CIRCUIT WORK
2926,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2927,USING MAGNETS SO YOU HAVE MAGNETISM,USING MAGNETS TO S  HAS NEISM
2928,THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRICITY,THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRIC
2929,WHAT PICTURE,WHAT PICTURE
2930,WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAVE THAT WHAT,WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONE THATHAVE THER
2931,IF WIRES BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE WHICH SHOULD MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,IT FLOWS BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRES ARE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES RON NEGATIVESIDE WHICH IS MAKING IT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
2932,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2933,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNO
2934,FOR AN ELECTRICITY BE GOING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT,FOR  ELECTRICITY B GOING THROUGH THE CIRCUI
2935,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
2936,HI MORNIE,BYE MARNIE
2937,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THERE IS NOTHING THERE IS NO WIRE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE IS ONLY WIRE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THE THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO WIRE'S TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S ONLY WIRE'S TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE S
2938,THERE ARE LIKE BULBS ARE GLOW,THE LIGHT BULBS ARE AC
2939,THEY LONG GLOW POSSIBLY,THEY WON'T GLOW POSSIBLY
2940,IT REFLECTED BY IT WILL GET MAY BE IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND MORE D CELL TO YOU GET FIT IN THIS,IT EFFECTIT BY IT WILL GET MAYBE IT'LL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER THE MORE D CELLS YOU GET FIT IN THE
2941,I'M,ON THE
2942,GOOD,GOOD
2943,WHEN WIRE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONE SIDE AND ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB GLOW,ONE WIREIS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONE ONE WIR IS TOUCHING THE THE ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONE SIDE AND ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICHHS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB GLOW
2944,IT CHANGES THE SERIES CIRCUIT BY IF LIKE RIGHT NOT HAS ONE D CELL AND IT'S MAKING A NOT CLOSER BRIGHT BUT WHEN YOU MAKE ANOTHER D CELL PUT ANOTHER D CELL AND IT MAKES IT MORE BRIGHTER AND THERE ARE LIGHT BULBS GLOW BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE ON D CELL ONE THERE IS ONE BATTERY WHICH IS MAKING A GLOW TO LOW,IT CHANGES A SERIES CIRCUIT BY IF LIKE RIGHT NOW HAS ONE D CELL AND T'S MAKING IT NOT GLOWS O BRIGHT BUT WHEN YOU MAKE ANOTHER D CELL AND PUT ANOTHER D CELL AND IT MAKES IT MORE BRIGHTER AND THEN THE LIGHT BULBSGLOW BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE IT BUT ON D CELL ONE THERE'S THERE'S ONLY ONE ABOUTTER WHICH IS MAKING IT GLOW TO LOW

2960,THE GUY THE GUY SEES HIMSELF IN COLOR BECAUSE THE LIGHT BEHIND HIM IS,THE GUY STHE GUY SEES  SEULF AND COLOR BECAUSE THE LIGHT BEHIND HEM IS AR
2961,THE LIGHT IS BEING REFLECTED UM TOO MANY TIMES FOR THE LIGHT TO TRAVEL AND THE LIGHT IS LOSING SOME MOST OF IT'S ENERGY AND THEN BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE STAR THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MORE,THE LIGHT IS BEING REFLECTED U TOO MANY TIMES FOR THE LIGHT TO TRAVEL AND THE LIGHT IS LUSING SOME OF MOST OF ITS ENERGY AND THEN BY THE TIME IT GETS THE STAR THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MORE
2962,REFLECTING LIGHT OFF OF THE MIRROR IT'S WE USE TO REFLECT TO REFLECT LIGHT OFF OF IT AND THEN AND THEN TO MAKE A REFLECTION ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING,REFLECTING LIGHT OFF OF THE MIRROR IT'S BENG USED TO REFLECT TO REFLECT LIGHT OFF OF IT AND THEN AND THEN TO MAKE A REFLECTION ON THE SIDE OF THE BILDING

3866,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,UM WELL WE'RE JUST LARING THE JUST GNIN NA MAKE A COOL CONTRACTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER  THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWIST IT IT UP IT'S GONA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOEAH THE PROPELLER POWER AND AND THEN E'R ONTA TRY PUTING PASSENGERS OR ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS AR PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH
3867,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERS THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST I KIND TO SIT THERE
3868,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULDAFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USED TO BUILD IT THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
3869,S SO,SO
3870,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THE THE FRIGHT FLIGT LINE LOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP WORD AND YEAH IT LOOK WELL IT T LOOKS LIKE IT'S SILLEDED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH
3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,UM THE SPINNING KIND LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS YU WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GONNA GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE A PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWIST THE PROPELLER BUT UM YOU ALSO NEED SOMETHIN WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE BE LIKE CHARES SO THAT THE WIRE WILL IT'S LIKE STAY ON SO HAT THE WIRE WIRE WE CAN TIE THEWIRE TO THE CHRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND A HAVE PAPER UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN TH BOTTO E PUT THE PROPELLER ON A JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
