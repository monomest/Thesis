0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ANL THE WAY TO TWENTY TWO
1,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPERCLIPSE AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERY ONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HITE THEIR DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEA YEA
2,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,OH PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
3,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE A SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE A LENGTH OF THE STRING
4,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,AH PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE SAW IT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENTS I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
5,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEACHER AND WE SO AM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG N THE SMALLEST AND WE ROTE ON ONE TIME IT WAS A LENGTH IN THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE A TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE IAM NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THER LENGTH EN THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
6,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SSO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN BECAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY E JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY SAND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS WINGS THAT GOT SO
7,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM OM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESK WERE AT OUR DSK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND THEN ON THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE ON I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT SENEMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT SENIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
8,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND TEIT GOT SMALLER AN SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE THE LEAST WINGS WAS FIVE
9,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WILL YA AT FIRST WE TRWE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD EFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS AM LENGTH AM A STARTING POINT AND THEN AM A IF LIKE THE FORCE SAID THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE HIS FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
10,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO IM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP IN A PENNY AND YOU ATTACHED THE STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN I'M THE I I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THE YOU'E GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST WINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN I'M TO MAKE THE THE PENDULUM SWING LAST SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOULL HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER
11,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YES WE'SED IN PENDULENCE SO LIKE UMWE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
12,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR BUT BE U BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOMELIKE WE KEPT HAVING THO EXPERIMENT UNTIL EVERY ONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
13,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YET THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISES PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
14,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEA
15,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UN WE WWE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO AN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICKWETS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER WENT TO WHAT HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS IKE THAT SORT OF SO WENT UP INSTEAD UPDOWN
16,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE WE TESTED WITH A DIFFERENT THING IN STUFF
17,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES IM WERE HOW FAR OR I HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSHED DOWN THE IM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN FLINKY EDES THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN IM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
18,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,IN TO GRAPHIT SO YOU KNOW WELL A WELL SI YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED IN WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
19,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AM A WHOLE BUNCH OF ADIFFERENT AM EXPERIMENTS IN STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOUTS AME A SOM WHAT ELSE WE DID A FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS
20,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THAN WHEN WE WEN THE CUT WHEN WE SHALL THE CLASS HOW TO DO ITSO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MODOR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE
21,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOUT HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
22,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,I'M JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WE BETTINBUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED OUR DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORKING A CORKING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
23,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY TO NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED INSTA
24,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,YE AND THEN AFT WELL THEN WE TESTED WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
25,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFOR ECAUSE WE MADE A RECORING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ASER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY AND WIT SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CAIN IMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT A FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THATS WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHAT WE ADDED ALL THOSE TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YE
26,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WE ALL CAME UP WITH SPIRI VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS STIN AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW ON HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
27,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE EXAXES AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE WHIE AXESS WHEL THE WHI AXES IS RIGHT HERE THE EXCESS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED AND LET SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE WHIE AXES THERE WAS E WELL AND THEN THERE WAS THE COW LONG THE HOW FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR I WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOK
28,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAFT  DON'T KNOW WHAN IT TO CALLED STILL BUT OM WE IT WAS THERE AS AN EX AXIS IN A WIAXIS THE EX AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE WIAXIS WAS WHIT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND NOU
29,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE WYAXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT
30,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALLUMIN BALL IN THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAT OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WAG THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEYTHEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL THA
31,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,AND THEN WELL SO SEND SIXES ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTILL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT AN MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RI BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE AN WE GOT THE STICK AND WHEN SHE CHOSE TO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO AN I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LO AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAV IS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY INTO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT OPPOSITE
32,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,U IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH SUM ER IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS OR THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FOR THROT WAGGA
33,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HADE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPSE JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLATE SO I BEG TO HAVE THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER ITS GOING TO GET THAN BORE THE MORE SPENCE OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TO DAY WE DIDN'T WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD SCIENCE AND THEN PEAN THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
34,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YA AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TREATED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK A TUSE WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALF WEYMARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
35,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YAN THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIENCE MEANT AND SO WE PUT IT AT ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST AND TO US CAUSE THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT A SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO PETE SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO
36,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN NO THAT WOULD BE COOL
37,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,T ACT LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT ELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY OH
38,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YA WERE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE OR NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WWERE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WERE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ONOH YAW WE'RES KEEPING FORTY SPINS  WE'RE JUST TRYING FORTY SPINS THIS THE REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
39,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLANS CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY THAT I WANT THE SWINGERS CAUSE WE HAVE THIS VARIABLE'S BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS A A WOMAN DOING  A LIKE I PICKED AHEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPERING OFF THE WHO SHE WAS DOING A BAULT AND I DO WALT LIKE I TAKE DMASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IS REALLY FUN THOUGH
40,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN AS LIKE SO YOU GO ROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETET AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOU THING YET ONE TO LIKE YE AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY TESTED IT LIKE ONCE
41,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PARTED FROM THE BOTTOM IT WULD JUST SO THAT WAS SLOPE A ONE WAS UMWAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MABBY THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED
42,OH THE UH THEY'RE UM FLINGERS THE FLIPPERS AND THEN WE THESE ARE THE UH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AWESOME,OH THE AH THER AR FLINGERS THE FLFERS AND THE WE BEEARE THERE A THE PENDULUMS AND THEN THE BOATS AS SOUND
43,YEAH HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALFWAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO HO WE TRIED TO DO UH WE WERE WE WERE JUST TESTING IT AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE UM SWAY SPINS AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE N ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KI I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAYBE,YE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET WITH HALF WAY AND WE GOT THIRTY THREE AND THEN WE TRIED TO DO WHWE TRIED TO DO A WE WERE WEERE JUST HASTING ATE AGAIN CAUSE SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER WE TRIED JUST WE JUST DID WE DID FIFTY THREE OM SWAT SPINSE AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND HAD A LITTLE MORE SPINS SO WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND IT WORKED AND THE ACTUALLY FIFTY ONE AND A HALF ABOUT FIFTY TWO AND THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE ALREADY HAD SIXTY FOR THAT SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT AN WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE GOT SIXTY WE JUST KINDHING I THINK THAT WE WERE MISCOUNTING I GUESS MAY BE
44,YEAH WE GET TO USE IT AND S CAUSE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FANS SO AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRY THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND IT GOES IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT UM IT'S WE'RE DOING S LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHER'S UM ARM SPANS LIKE WING SPAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN AND WITH THE FAN SO,YA WE GET TO USE IT AND CASE LIKE PEOPLE FORGOT TO BRING IN THEIR FAN SO AND NOW WARGRANA TRI THE FAN AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO TURN ON THE FAN AFTER YOU DO SWINGS AND A GA IT JUST LIKE FLIES IT'S REALLY COOL BUT IT A IT WE'RE DOING LIKE SIX OF MY TEACHERS ON ARMED  SPANS LIKE WINGS PAN SO IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN FOUR METERS SO IT WENT ABOUT FOUR METERS WITH THE SPIN EN WITH THE FAN
45,YEAH YEAH AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE DOING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THE OUR VARIABLES WERE UM LIKE TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING UM SLOPE,E AND THEN WE NAMED THE VARIABLES WE WERE TOING THE VARIABLES THEN SO THAT OUR VARIABLES WERE AM LIKE TIGHTNESS OP THE STRING ON SLOPE
46,COUNTING OR MAYBE THE PROPELLER WAS JUST IT GOT MAYBE THE RUBBER BAND WAS A LITTLE TIGHT SO IT HAD TO GET LOOSEN UP BEFORE YOU COULD DO IT I DON'T KNOW,COUNTINGS OR MAYBE THE PROPELLER WICH JUST IT GOT MAYBE THAT RUBBER BRAND WAS A LITTLE TIGHT SO IT HAD TO GET LOOSEN UP BEFORE YOU COULD DO IT I DON'T KNOW
47,WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT LA WELL YEAH THAT WAS THE STRING UM WE SORT OF WENT THE THESE GLIDERS YOU CAN WELL THE PROPELLERS YOU CAN TWIST UP AND UM YOU JUST KEEP TWISTING IT UP UNTIL THE RUBBER BAND LIKE SORT OF TIES AROUND ITSELF AND THEN YOU LET GO ON A STRING AND IT GOES LIKE FLYING IT'S REALLY AWESOME,WELL WED HAVE THAT LOT WELL YET THAT WAS THE STRING A WE SORT OF WHEN THE THESE GLIDERS YOU CAN WELL THE PROPELLERS YOU CAN TWIST UFF ANT AND YOU JUST KEEP TWISSING IT UP UNTIL THE RUBBER RAN LIKE SORT OF TIES AROUND ITSELF AND THEN YOU LET GO ON A STRING AND IT GOES LIKE FLYING IT'S REALLY HOSSILE
48,THIS IS THE RUBBER BAND AND IT'S PUT ON SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TWIST IT WITH THIS THE PROPELLERS ATTACHED TO IT THERE'S THIS LITTLE HOOK AND THEN UM WELL THEN WE WROTE OUR NA OUR PLANE NAME ON IT UM THE FRONTIER GLIDER AND THEN WE SORT OF GOT A SH WE WERE IN THIS AREA AND WE PUT A CHAIR ON ONE EN WE END OF THE LOCKERS AND THEN ON THE OTHER END AND THEN WE TIED A SH WE HAD A STRING TAPED TO IT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GO ZOOM AFTER YOU LIKE TWISTED IT A LOT UM HOW MUCH YOU TWISTED IT IT W THE PROPELLERS WOULD GET GOING AND IT WOULD SPIN AROUND LIKE T ON WE WIND,THIS IS THE RUBBER BND AND IT'S PUT ON SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TWIST IT WITH THIS THE PROPELLERS ATTACHED TO IT THERE'S THIS LITTLE HOOK AND THEN A WELL THEN WE WER OUR NAME OUR PLAIN NAME ON IT ON THE FRONTIER GLIDER AND THEN WE SORT OF GOT US WE WERE IN THE ARIA WE PUT A CHEER ON ONE  END OF THE LACKERS AND THEN ON THE OTHER END AND THEN WE TIED US WE HAD A STRING TAPE TO IT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GO ZOON AFTER YOU LIKE TWISTED IT ALOT AH HOW MUCH YOU TWISTED IT ITTHE PROPELLERS WOULD GET GOING AN THEY WOULD SPIN AROUND LIKE UNWIT WINE
49,YEAH YEAH WE ALL TRIED AND WE EACH WE DECIDED MA ME MY PARTNER KELLY AND MY PARTNER DREW UM WE ALL WE TRIED UM TO WE WERE GOING TO DO FORCE SO WE DECIDED TO USE A FAN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A FAN BECAUSE ONE FAN BATTERIES WAS DYING OUT AND ONE FAN YOU HAD TO PLUG IN AND IT ONLY HAD ONE SETTING AND LIKE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PARTICIPATING BECAUSE WE HAD TO SHARE A LINE WITH THIS THESE OTHER GR THIS OTHER GROUP SO,YE WEWE ALL TRIED AND WECH WE DECIDED MOT ME MY PARTNER KELLE AND MY PARTNER DREW OM WE ALL WE TRIED AM TO WE WERE GOING TO DO FORCE SO WE DECIDED TO USE A FAN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A FAND BECAUSE ONE FAN BATTERIES WAS DYING OUT WEN ONE FANNY HAD TO PLUG IN AND THEMOLY ADDED WENE SETTING AND LIKE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PARTICIPATING BECAUSE WE HAD TO SHARE A LINE WITH THIS THESE OTHER TIS OTHER GROUP SO

51,YEAH OKAY AND THEN WE CALLED THAT THE S S E B CAUSE THEN THE FOURTH ONE WE CALLED IT THE S S N D CAUSE YEAH,Y OQ AND THEN WE CALLED THAT THE S S E BECIUSIN THE FOURTH ONE WE CALLED IT THE S S N D IS OUHA
52,I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SAID THAT ON OUR DIRECTIONS BUT LIKE I GUESS WELL THEN THERE'S A HUGE RANGE AND STUFF,I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SET THAT ON OUR DIRECTIONS BUT LIKE I GUESS WELL THEN THERE'S A HUGE RANGE IN STA
53,UH PROBABLY CAUSE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MEASURE RIGHT OR AND MAYBE UH I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THE BIGGER BOATS PROBABLY HAD LESS BUT NOW I'M THINKING THAT THE BIGGER BOATS HELD MORE BECAUSE,OH PROBABLY CAUSE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MEASURE RIGHT OR AND MAYBE A I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THE BIGGER BOATS PROBABLY HELD LESS BUT NOW I'M THINKING THAT THE BIGGER HOTEL NORA BECAUSE WAIT
54,BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S TEN LESS I'M NOT SURE YEAH BECAUSE IT'S ONE LESS THAN THREE CENTIMETERS SO AND THEN WE DI I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY LIKE TEN AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE WALKED TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP TO TEN AND WE DREW A DOT AND THEN WE TRIED TO CONNECT A LINE A STRAIGHT LINE BUT OUR LINE SORT OF ENDED UP CURVED LIKE THAT SORT OF,BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S TEN LESS I'M NOT SURE WEWER WA BECAUSE IT'S BUT ONE LESS THAN THREE CENTMETERS AND THEN WEDI I DON'T REMEMBER IT BUT I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY LIKE TEN AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE WALKED TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP TO TEN WE DREW A DOT AND THEN WE TRIED TO CONNECT A LINE A STRAIGHT LINE BUT OUR LINE SOD HAVE ENDED UP CURVE LIKE THAT SO ID HAVE
55,YEAH UM I WAS THINKING HOW FULL THE WATER WAS BUT THAT'S SORT OF IT DOESN'T R LIKE IT WAS SORT OF A YEAH BUT IT WE REALLY COULDN'T MEASURE THAT S SO WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEN ALSO IT SAID THE PENNIES UH THEY NEED TO BE DROPPED A CERTAIN WAY SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A BOAT RIGHT HERE YOU HAD TO DROP YOUR PENNIES IN UH LIKE A TRIANGLE YOU SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR BOAT AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND LIKE YOU SORT OF JUST FILL UP LIKE SHE HAD IT ON THE OVERHEAD AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IT YOU WANNA LIKE THE PENNIES WERE BLACK ON THE OVERHEAD AND SHE DREW A CUP ON IT AND SHE PUT THE PENNIES DOWN AND SHE WANTED THE WHOLE CUP TO BE FILLED WITH BLACK THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO AIM FOR MY TEACHER,YA ON I WAS THINKING HOW FULL THE WATER WAS BUT THAT SORT OF IT DOESN'T LIKE IT WAS SORT OF ANI YAH BUT IT WE COULDN'T REALLY MEASURE THAT SO WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEN ALSO IT SAID THE PENNIES AH THEY NEED TE BE DROPPED A CERTAIN WAY SO LIKE IF YOU HAD A BOATRIGHT HERE YOU HAD TO DROP YOUR PENNIES IN  LIKE A TRIANGLE YOU SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR BOAT AND THEN YOU DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AND THEN DROP A PENNY IN HERE HERE AND HERE AD LIKE YOU SORT OF JUST FILL UP LIKE SHE HAD IT ON THE OVERHEAD AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IT YOU WANTED LIKE THE PENNIES WERE BLACK ON THE OVERHEAD AND SHE DREW A CUP ON IT AND SHE PUT THE PENNIES ON AND SHE WANTED THE WHOLE CUP TO BE FILLED WITH BLACK THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO AIM MY TEACHER
56,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERYONE GOT A DIFFERENT UM MILLILITER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PA NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT W NUMBERS OF MILLILITERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW,SO THE WATER WE JUST WANTED TO TEST HOW MUCH WATER COULD GET INTO IT CAUSE MAYBE LIKE IN OUR THREE CENTIMETERS ALMOST EVERY ONE GOT A DIFFERENT A MILLELEADER OF WATER LIKE IT WAS A BIG HUGE RANGE LIKE WE ALL HAD THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND BUT WE ALL GOT DIFFERENT PAT NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF MILLILEATERS OF WATER SO I DON'T KNOW
57,NO SHE GAVE US A COPY OF THE GRAPH OH YEAH THANK YOU AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOAT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOAT FOUR BUT I'M AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME,NO SHE GAVE US A COKYOOH YE THINK YE AND THEN AFTER THAT WE HAD LIKE THIS SORT OF THING UP HERE AND IT HAD LIKE BOT ONE BOAT TWO AND BOAT THREE AND ALSO BOAT FOR BET AND NUTCHES AND THEN WE WENT LIKE THAT AND IT SAYS THE UM NAME
58,WELL I RE I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OUR BUT UH WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTIMETER I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AMO MILLILITERS AND THEN UH I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY,WELL I I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WATER WE GOT IN OURS BUT A WE GOT A LOT IN SOME OF THEM IN THE FIVE CENTAMETERS I THINK WE GOT LIKE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AMILLA TEYERS AND THEN A I'M NOT SURE THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO DAY
59,YEAH CAUSE THIS IS THE Y AXIS I THINK X AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE Y AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGERS,CAUSE THIS IS THE WHY ACCESS I THING EX AND THEN AND THEN THIS IS THE WHY AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THE PASSENGER
60,UM THAT WAS WE WOULD WE DID THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE IT SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY IN S YOU COULD JUST FLIP OVER,UM THAT WAS WE WOULD WE DO THAT SORT OF WE SORT OF ALSO PUT LIKE SORT OF TIPS ONE SIDE EVEN WITH NO PENNIES IN SO WE HAD TO PUT IT ON ONE SIDE AND TH PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT WOULD SLIDE  YOU OT SO YOU' HAVE TO PUT IT IN REALLY WHERE IT'S TIPPING I MEAN LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WERE IT'S TIPPING CAUSE NO WANT TO PUT ANOTHER PENNY IN UCOULD JUST LOOP OVER
61,WELL WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD PARTNERS AND STUFF YEAH UH WELL THEY HELPED US MAKE IT AND UH THEN,WHELE WE WERE PARTNERS LIKE WE HAD O PARTNER IN STA WWE WE W AH WELL THEY HELP US MAKE IT AND AH THEN
62,UH LESS BECAUSE THIS E IT'S SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER AND IT ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND,AH LESS BECAUSE THIS ITS SHORTER LIKE CAUSE WE ET MEASURED LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS IN THAT ONE GOT A HUNDRED FIVE MELLED LEADERS OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WE MEASURED A TWO CENTIMETER NA ONLY GOT LIKE THIRTY FIVE MILLE LEADERS OF WATER AND TA'S BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTER AND
63,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N E CAUSE MY K PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FI SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE IT'S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN UP HERE YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE,AND THEN SO AN WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S AND E CAUS MIKE PARTNER WAS NATON SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE SENTIMADE OR ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LI I DON'T REMEMBER ALL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WITH SEVENTY FA SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE STRAIGHT HERE WAS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN OFWE YES AND THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE
64,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID A WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VOTES AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF VOTES LIKE IDID A FIVE THAT WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
65,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,O O K SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TO DAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN
66,UH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAPH A LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFF TO,AH I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE LOOKED AT THE GRAFE LOT I GUESS AND I JUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY TO REMEMBER STUFFTALE
67,UH YEAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAPH IT WAS CALLED THOUGH BUT WE LIKE WITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL AND LIKE ON THE GRAPH WE GRAPHED WITH OUR LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE LET'S SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MILLILITERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY UH PASSENGERS I GOT SO YEAH SURE,AH YAH WE DID I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT MY TEACHER TOLD US TO WALK BEFORE WE FLY I FORGET WHAT GRAFFIT WAS CALLED THO BUT WE LIKE WWITH OUR BOATS LIKE WELL NOT WITH OUR BOATS WE DID IT WITH A PENCIL LIKE ON THE GRAFT WE GRAFT WITH  LIKE OUR BOATS WHAT OUR BOATS DID LIKE WE WOULD FIND THE CAPACITY IT HELD AND THEN WE WOULD WALK TO IT LIKE THE SAY I GOT LIKE THREE CAPACITY THREE MELILADERS OF CAPACITY AND THEN I WOULD GO UP AND FIND HOW MANY A PASSENGERS I GOT SO YES WA SHER
68,OKAY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN AND WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE S S E N AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEAH LIKE YEAH IT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PROBABLY,AY AND SO WE WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND  WE GOT UP TO SEVENTEEN WE PUT A DOT THERE AND THEN THIS WAS THE AS AS THE EN AND IT WAS OUR FIVE CENT A METR BEAT WE GOT A HUNDRED FIVE CAPACITY SO WE HAD TO DO BIGGER LIKE WE HAD TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE AND THEN I WAS OUR PASSENGERS WAS THIRTY SEVEN WAS  YA LIKE ARMOIT WOULD BE HIGHER IT WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT HERE PALASI
69,WELL YEAH BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE PR YEAH IT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTIONS,WELL YOU HAVE BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS ON MEASURING AND SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MEASURE LIKE EXACTLY AND WELL WE YOU AT SAID EXACTLY ON OUR DIRECTION
70,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE BOATS WE STERTALY MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS A ECBLE LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTOETERS AND THEN A WE DID THAT BECAUSE A WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A CYRANGE INTO IT AND THEN SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SARANGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRATULATED EN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURE AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
71,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH OH O KAY THAT O CA THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING NEW SO A WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO A TO EFFECT THAT EFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND PUT IT IN BECAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOE THE END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
72,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DID THIS WAS OUR TWO SAID AN METER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PAF A WE DIDN'T RELI TO TO TREASON YAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS
73,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,ABN WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO CALLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR AH YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO
74,WELL YEAH YEAH WE DID WE UH I SORTA FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THERE WAS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,WE A HA WE DID WE LIKE I SORT OF FORGET CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT THEREAS WE TALKD ABOT A LATIN OT THING AND
75,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE SANMETER ROATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOATNUMER THREE AND LIKE THER IT WAS A HUGE RAIN OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
76,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,AMBECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE SAINT  ORHOLL CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOMEAN GE FUNFINDIN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DAND FOR TO THE PENNIES AND LIKE WIT THE THREE SENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
77,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTM WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME SO
78,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YA E BECAUSE DO YOU WANT TO FIND WE WANT TO HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR YOUR EXPERIEMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOUOD DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANT TO KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO AN END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN AR OR THAR OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A AM ALL IN ALL AM MO A A THREE SENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLVED TWELVE SEND TWELVE PENNIES
79,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME SE'S OVER THERE YE UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD THE LESS NO LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TO DAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS LOVED LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENT A METER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES AND I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN THAN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM
80,WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE AND WE PUT ONE SPOON OF SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEN THEN YOU SHAKE IT AND SAW THE WATER RISE,AND WE BUT ONE SPOON OF SALT WE AN WE PUT ONE SPOON ASALT INTO T E FIFTY MILLE EATERS OF WATER  THEN WE SHAKED IT AND SALEMN WATER RISE
81,THERE'S FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION AND THERE IS FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF THE SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE,THERE'S FIFTY MILL LEADERS OF SALT SALUTION AND THERE IS FIFTY MILL LEADERS OF WATER IN THE FIFTY MILL LEADERS OF THE SALT SALUTION WAYSMORE
82,THERE IS THIRTY FIVE GRAMS IN ONE CUP AND THERE'S TWENTY FIVE IN ANOTHER CUP AND THIRTY FIVE GRAMS PLUS TWENTY FIVE GRAMS EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS AND PLUS SIXTY,NIN THERE IS THIRTY FIVE GRAMS AN ONE CUP AND THERE'S TWENTY FIVE AND ANOTHER CUP AND THIRTY FIVE GRAMS W IVE GRAMS E CLOE FIFTY GRAMS WIL TER SIXY GRAMS O THUS MOT PRETTY WON
83,IT TOOK FOUR SCOOPS FROM THE SALT TO SATURATE THE WATER AND IT TOOK THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT TO SATURATE THE OTHER,IT TOOK FOUR SKINS FROM THE SATRIC SAL TO SATURATE THE WATER AND TORK THREE COOPS OF SBEEN SOUGHT TO SATURATE THE OTHER
84,THE SUGAR THE SUGAR WATER IS WEIGHS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS WEIGHS THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF THE SUGAR WATER WEIGHS ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND FIFTY MILLILITERS OF,THE SUGAR THE SUGAR WATER IS WEIGHS ONE HUNDRED GRAN WEIGHT THE FIFTY MILLE LEADERS OF SUGAR WALL WEIGHS ONE POUNDS AND FIFTY MIE LEADERS OF S

86,OF WATER THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WEIGHS LESS THAN WEIGHS LESS THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WHEN IT FINISHES SATURATING THE THE I DON'T KNOW,TERS OF WATER THE FIFTY MILL LEADERS OF WATER WAGSTE LESS THAN WAGTE LESS THAN THE FIFTY MILLE LEADERS OF WATER WHEN IT FINISHES SATRADING TH THUS I DON'T KNOW
87,THE ONE WITH THE MORE COOL AID POWDER WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE COOL AID THE ONE WITH LESS COOL AID POWDER WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE,THE ONE WITH HE MORE COOLID POWDER WOULD TASTE MORM THY COOLY THE ONE WITH LESS COLAD POWARED WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE WA
88,THERE'S THE GRAPE TEST STICK THERE'S ONE SPOON OF GRAPE TEST STICK IN IN ONE CUP AND TWO SPOONS IN THE OTHER,THEREIS THE GRAPE TASTIC  HEREIS ONE SPOON A GRAPE TAS IGIN AND ONE CUP AND TWO SPOONS AND THE OTHER
89,THERE IS MORE POWDER ON THE CUP WITH THE FIVE CRYSTALS AND THERE IS LESS POWDER ON THE CUP WITH THE TWO CRYSTAL,THERE'S MORE POWDER ON THE CUP WITH THE FIVE CRYSTALS OF NUSE LES POWDER ON THE CUP WITH THE TWO CRYSTAL
90,THE DARKER ONES HAVE MORE POWDER AND LESS WATER AND LESS AND THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THAT ARE MUCH LIGHTER ARE HAVE LESS POWDER BUT MORE WATER,THE RE ONES HAVE MORE POWDER AND LESS WATER IN US AND THE ONE THAT DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THAT ARE MUCH LIGHTER ER HAVE LETS POWDER BUT MORE WATER
91,UM BOTH CUP THERE'S FIFTY MORE THE USE OF WATER BUT ON THE DARKER CUP THERE'S FIVE SPOONFULS OF DRINK MIX AND THE LIGHTER ONE HAS ONE SPOON ONE SPOONFUL OF DRINK,ON BOTH CUP OF FIFTY MU LEATLES OF WATER BUT ON THE DARKERCUP THER FIVE SPOONFULS OF DRINKMIXAND THE LIGHTEN ONE HAS ONE SPOON ONE SPOONFUL OF DRIN
92,THE FIRST CUP HAS LOTS OF POWDER THE SECOND CUP IS GET LESS POWDER THEN THE THIRD CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LESS HAS LESS POWDER AND THEN THE FOURTH CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LESS AND MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER AND THE THE THE LAST ONE HAS LESS POWDER AND MORE,BUT FIRST CUP HAS GOTS OF POWDER THE SECOND CUP A E STANDING GET LESS SPOUDER THAN THE THIRD CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LESS HAS LESS POWDER THEN THE FOURTH CUP HAS MORE WATER AND LESS AND MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER AND THE THE FIRT THE LAST ONE HAS LESS POWDER AND MORE
93,THE ONE THAT'S LIGHTER HAS SIX DRINK MIX AND THIRTY MILLIGRAMS OF WATER THE ONE THAT'S DARKER BUT THE ONE THAT'S LIGHTER HAS THREE THREE SPOONFULS OF DRINKING MIX THIRTY MILLIGRAMS OR THIRTY GRAMS MILLIGRAMS OF WATER,THE ONE THAT'S MITER HAS SIX HUNWILE DRINKM SIMPLURITY MILLGRIMS WATER THE ONE THAT'S DARKER BUT THE ONE THAT LIGTER HAS THREE THREESPOONFULS A DRINKING MIKES THIRTY MIRAN THE THIRTYDAM MILLGRIMS WATER
94,THERE'S GRAINS AND THERE'S PAPER CLIPS AT THE IN IN A CUP THEN YOU PUT A MAGNET ON TOP AND IT COLLECTS ALL THE PAPER,THEREIS GRAINS ANOTHERS PAPER CRIPS AT A IN IN THE CUP AND THEN YOU PUT A MAGGOTET ON TOP IN THE COLLECT OF THE PAPE
95,YOU MIX NO YOU DIP THE WATER WITH THE ROCKS SO THE ROCKS STAYED ON THE STAYED ON THE STAYED ON THE STAY ON THE,WHEN YOU MIX NO YOU DIP TE WATER WITH THE ROCKS OF THE ROCKS STAYED ON THE STAYED ON THE I IT AMIT AM IT I DONT TENSTAY ON THER IT'S
96,CAUSE IF SHE POURED IN THE WATER ALL OF IT WOULD ALL OF IT WOULD STAY OUT AND WITH THE MAGNET IT WOULD JUST COLLECT THE PAPER CLIPS,CULD IS SHE POURED IT IN WATER ALL OF IT WAY ALL OF IT WOULD STAY OUT AND WITH THE MAGNET WOULD JUST COLLECT THE PAPERCLICKS
97,THE FIRST ONE IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER AND THE AND TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTION THEN THE NEXT ONE IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER AND,THE FIRST WHAT IT IS SEVENTY FIVE MIL METERS OF WATER AND THE AND TEN GRAMS OFSO SHIP THEN HER SEVE THE DEXT E MUS SELLI EFFECT MILLON LEADERS OF WATER AND LAN
98,WE PUT IN A JAR OF FREEZING AND OF WATER AND THEN PUT IT IN THE FREEZER AND SINCE THE LID WAS SO TIGHT THERE WASN'T ROOM FOR THE ICE TO GO OUT OF THE TOP SO IT BREAKS THE GLASS AND THEN YOU PUT THE WARM WATER BECAUSE IT WAS HOT,WE PUTE A JAR OF FREET AND OF WATER AND THEN PUT IT IN THE FREATUR AND SINCE THE WID WAS TO TIGHT TO ROSEN ROOM FOR THE ICE TO GO OUT WHERE THE TOP SAW IT BREAKS THE GLASS THEN WIT THE WARM OTERAT BECAUSE IT WAS HO
99,THE ROCK BREAKS APART AND AND FALLS OFF THE HILL AND FALLS INTO THE WATER AND THE WATER SHEDS IT INTO,THE ROCK BREAKS APORANTE AND FALLS OFF THE HILL OF AND FORSINTO THE WOTER AND THE PUSHES IT INTO
100,THAT THE ROCK GOT FILLED UP WITH WATER AND THEN IT FROZE AND THEN IT EXTENDED AND BROKE DOWN IT AND JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL AND MAY JUNE JULY AND NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER PASSED AND THEY,THEY A ROCKA FILLED UP WIT WATER AND THEN IT FROZE AN IT EXTANDED AND BROKE DOWN AN JANUARY FEBRUARY MAR SAPER ON MAD TO INJULY NOVEMBER TO SOUTPEST AND THEY CHANTED OBBLEBY
101,WHEN IT'S ACID RAIN THE RAIN FALLS IN JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY NOVEMBER TWO YEARS PAST AND IT GETS ALL MOLDY AND THEN YEAH,WHEN IT'S AS ATE RAIN THE RAIN FALLWS HE JANUARY FEBRUARY MON SA PER MDE JUIN JULY AUGUST TEMER NOVEMBER DECEMBER ABRUARY MARCH SABELL MAE YU JELA SOMEBI NOT MEMBER TIS TWO YEARS PASS AND IT GETS ALMOLT AND DEN AS YET  THE AL
102,BREAK INTO TWO PIECES DURING THE FREEZING THERE'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF CRACKS AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WITH ROCKS INTO ICE SO YEAH,WHEN A  WI THE FREEZOS THERE'S ONLY A E  CRACKS AND THET IT T HAPPENS DID THAT IT ALL BROT OYA
103,THEY PUT A BOULDER BY THIS LITTLE CONTAINER THING AND THEN THEY POURED DOWN A A LITER OF WATER AND THEN IT FELL DOWN LIKE THE AND THEN IT FELL DOWN ON THE GROUND SO IT BUILDS DEPOSITION AND THEN IT CAME DOWN AND SHOWED HOW THE DEPOSITION WORKS,MAS UN THEY PUT A RULER BY THE LITTLE COMPANERTHINK AND THEY POURED DOWN A LEADER OF WATER AND THEN IT FELL DOWN LIKE THE AND THEN IT FELL DOWN ON THE GROUND FOR THE BUILLSE POSITION AND THEN CAME DOWN AND SHO HOW HE EPOSITION MARKS
104,THE EROSION IS LIKE AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHEN WHERE WATER FALLS DOWN LIKE AT A CREEK DEPOSITION IS LIKE LIKES,N THE IRERSION IS LIKE A THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHEN WHERE WATER FALLS DOWN LIKE A CREEK THE POSITION IS LIKE LAKES
105,THE SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE AND SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO SINCE SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE IT MIXED AROUND SOLUTION A SINCE IT WENT AT THE TOP,THE SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE IN SINLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO SEN SOLUTION B ITS MORE DENSE IT MIXES THE RESOLUTION A SINCE IT WENT OT THE TALP
106,OH ONCE YOU BEND THERE'S LITTLE CHEMICALS INSIDE IT AND ONCE YOU BEND IT THEY BREAK AND THE LIGHT STARTS TO COME OUT,OH ONCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE'S LILL CHEMICLSERSIDE IT AND ONE YHE BENDET THEY'D BREAK AND LIGHT STERS TO COME OUT
107,THEY PUT BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE IN A CUP WITH NOTHING IN IT THEN THEY GRABBED A CUP OF WATER WITH FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND MIXED IT WITH THE BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THEN MADE A PREDICTION,THE BAKING SOT AND CLATT IM ORIT IM A CUP OF NUTING IN IT THAN  DO NOT THEY GRAVE TO CUP OF WATER WITH FIFTY MILLER LEATERS OF WATER AND MIXED IT WITH THE BAK O SORT AN CLASSER CHLORA AND AMAT A PREDIBTION

199,WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES IT TAKES BUT IT'S TAKES LIKE THREE HUNDRED DEGREES TO GET TO BOILING POINT,WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES IT TAKES WHAT IT TAKES LIKE THREE HUNDRED DEGREES TO GET TO BOILING POINT
200,THOSE ARE ICE CUBES WHEN THE ICE CUBES MELT THEY'RE GONNA TURN INTO WATER AND THAT WATER'S GOING TO BE COLD WHICH IS GOING TO FILL IT UP FILL IT UP MORE WHICH,THOSE ARE ICE CUBES WHEN THE ICE CUBES MELT THER GANA TURN INTO WATER AND THAT WATER IS GOING TO BE COLD WHICH IS GOING TO FILL IT UP FILL IT UP MORE WHICH
201,YES AND WE PUT WE MEASURED THE TEMPERATURE JUST WITH THE CUP AN OF THE WATER IT COME CAME OUT NOT FOR EVERYBODY IT DIDN'T COME OUT FOR EVERYBODY AND IT WAS IT WAS ABOUT LIKE ZERO CELSIUS,GUES AND WE PUT WE MATCHRED THE TEMPERATURE JUST WITH THE CUPIN OF THE WATER IT COME CAME OUT NOT FOR EVERYBODY IT DIDN'T COME OUT FOR EVERYBODY DI OSIT AND IT WAS IT WAS ABOUT TE TEZERSELSUS
202,THAT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS NO ACTUALLY IT'S NOT GONNA BE FIFTY FIFTY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LESS THAN FIFTY BUT I CAN'T PINPOINT EXACTLY THE C,THAT BONE TO BE FIFTY DEGREES ELSIES WELL SANLE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FILTH FIFTY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LESS THAN FIFTY BUT I CAN'T PANT POINT EXACTLY THE
203,E AND THEN THIS IS THREE THREE IT'S NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS LIKE EIGHTEEN AND THIS IS LIKE EIGHT,AND THEN THIS IS THREE THREE NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS LIKE EIGHTEEN THIS IS LIKE EIGHT
204,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS ONE IS LOWER THE THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS ONE'S THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY YES THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS WERAN IS LOWER THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS WAS THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY THAT THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY
205,OR AT SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE THE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICE YOU PUT IN IT,OR SOME POINT IT DOES SAY SAY THE SAME TEMPERATURE BUT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ICY PLURDICED
206,THEY'RE MIXING A AND B WHICH IS FIVE CELSIUS AND THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHAT'S HA GONNA HAPPEN IS B'S ACTUALLY GONNA OVERCOME THE A,THER MAXSING A AN B WHICH IS FIVE CELIS AN THIS IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREE SELCIES IN WHAT'S OUT GOING TO HAPPEN IS B IS ACTUALLY NO OVERCOME THE A
207,WHAT WE DID WAS WE POURED ICE INTO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERO IT TURNED INTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE NEGATIVE FIVE CELSIUS COLDER,WHAT HE DID WAS E PORD ICE IN TO IT AND THEN IT TURNED INTO FROM ZERA TURNEINTO LIKE NEGATIVE FIVE AND I GET UT FIVE SIL SIX COLDER
208,AND THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AND THEN MINUTES AFTER ONE M MINUTE IT W IT WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES,AN THEN IN TWO HOURS IT WAS RIGHT THERE THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS AN THE DMINUTES AFTER ONE MINUTE IT WAS THERE AND AFTER TWO MINUTES IT WAS THERE THREE MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES SIX MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES EIGHT MINUTES NINE MINUTES TEN MINUTES
209,UH HE'S GONNA DIP IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT FRIES CIRCUITS AND THEN HE DIE,ND HE DIN A DIP IT INSIGHT OF ONE OF THE THINGS BUT WORD HAPPEN AS IF HE REALLY WAS A ROBOT IT FRIED CIRCUIS AND THEN HE DIED
210,WELL THE VIALS WELL W THE VIALS COULD DO IS THEY'D LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS,WELL THE VIALS WHAT THE VIALS COULD DO IS DAYE LIKE SEE HOW MANY VIALS WOULD FILL UP ONE OF THOSE CUPS
211,UM NOT E NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK IS WE FILLED UH BABY DIAPER WITH WATER AND IT GOT LIKE REALLY BIG YEAH SERIOUSLY,IM NOT NOT COMPLETELY BUT WE DID SOME THINGS NOT VERY MUCH THHOUGH WELL WHAT WE DID THIS WEEK AS WE FILLED A BABY DIPRIRL WITH WATER AND I GOTLY GRILLY BIG YES SERIOUSLY
212,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OF LIQUID BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO IT FOR OR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE LEMONADE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OR SIMIL OR LE LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THERE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT A LEMONADE STAND AND ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THEY WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT,THOSE MARKS WERE WERE A STANDARD MATERAN O I IN  I  DO IT FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUAD BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE LEMONATE OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A STAND IN MEASUREMENT OR SOMEWAT OR LET'S MAKE AN EXAMPLE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT THEE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE AT ELEMONADE STAND AND THE ONE GETS A BIG GLASS AND THE OTHER GETS A LITTLE GLASS SO THAT'S WHY THA WE HAVE TO GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT
213,WHEN WE WEIGHED STUFF IN LIQUID IN LIQUID OR WHAT SOLIDS WE USED GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAW THAT UM TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE KILOGRAM IS A THOUSAND GRAMS,WHEN WE WASTE STUFF AND LIQUID PIPLY QUITTER WAT SOLID WE USE GRAMS FOR THAT AND WE SAWS THAT ON TWO KILOGRAMS IS TWO THOUSAND GRAMS FOR THE MEANS THAT OULN KILIGRAM MISSUS SOUSFOM GRAMS
214,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOILET PLUNGER LIKE A DA LIKE A UH NEEDLE THING LIKE YEAH YEAH LIKE,HOW MANY PLUNGERS IT TAKES NOT LIKE A TOIL IT PLUNGER LIKE A DOT LIKE A A NEEDLE THING LIKE SYE YA LIKE
215,WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MEASUREMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER,WHAT THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WAS FOR MAJORMENT WAS WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A MEATER
216,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE AND MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH,WELL HOW IT WAS LIKE HOW MANY STRAWS WERE THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK LIKE IN MINE WAS THREE IN THE WIDTH
217,WELL IT WASN'T THAT HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAW ON THE NUMBERS BUT WE HAD TO TAPE THEM E TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADD IT AND THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER,WELL IT WASN'T THE HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO A DRAW ON THE NUMBERS AND THEN AND I MEAN NOT DRAWN THE NUMBERS BUT T WE HAD TO TAPE LUM AND TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND THEN THEY'D ALL ADTED IN THEN ALL OF THEM WERE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ONE METER
218,WHAT WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW AN ANSWER WHEN YOU'RE LIKE Y WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU G IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,WHET WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T KNOW IT AND SIR WHEN YOU'RE LIKE WHEN YOU TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU YOU THEN YOU GO ON TO GUESSING IBECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU KNOW THAT YOU IF YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT YOU NOTHER YOU GOT I WRONG BECAUSE YOU DIN'T DO
219,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING,WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING I WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE LIKE LIKE RECORDED FOR EVERYTHING
220,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE IS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OURS AND THE OTHER CLASS MAZ M AND THEN OUR THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM,WHAT MADE ME REALIZE AS OUR WHOLE TABLE MEASURED OLARS AN THE OTHER GLASS MADE NON AT THE OTHER TABLES MEASURED THEIRS IN THEIR DIFFERENT SIZE EVERY ONE OF THEM
221,WE WE IN TODAY'S MATH STUMPER WE WE HAD TO IT SAID ESTIMATE IT SAID ESTIMATE WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS L ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS,E WE IN TO DAY'S MAST STUMPER WA WE TO E SAID AK THE MADE E SAID ASKE THE MAD WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE COMBINED IT WAS SEVEN LIKE IT WAS LET ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY THREE AND THEN IT WAS
222,NO BOTH WAYS MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND THEN THIS PERIMETER OH NOT THE PERIMETER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YEAH I DON'T REMEM LENGTH YEAH YEAH,NO BOTH UT MINE WAS THREE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUR THAT WAY AND LEN PEREMETER I NOT THE PERMER IT'S THE OTHER ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THAT WAY YET I DON'T REMEMBER LENGTH YET YET
223,WELL H H I WENT IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG,WELL I WEN IT WELL IF YOU'RE IF YOU ARE GUESSING YOU NEVER REALLY CAN GET IF YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO ESTIMATE YOU REALLY NEVER CAN GET AN ANSWER WRONG
224,WELL WELL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS,WHAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH MEASUREMENT IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH LIKE A DOING METERS ON SANIMETERS AND ANYTHING WITH METER AT THE END OF IT MILLIMETERS METERS
225,IS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL LIKE THAT,ITWAS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STAND OR MEASUREMENT AND YOU COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE OURPEN IS THE SAME AS YOUR WATCH AND YOUR PENCIL GUI THAT
226,YEAH WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER NOT LIKE A REAL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTOR'S USE YEAH,EU WE DID A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER YESTERDAY AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PLUNGER  OT LIGREEL PLUNGER BUT THE LIKE THE WHAT DOCTORS USE O WIT ISSRYA
227,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S ABOUT IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T WORK,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT OR ELSE AT WOULDN'T WORK
228,AND WE SQUIRT SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNGER COULD FILL AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TWO BECAUSE THE VIALS ARE LIKE THAT BIG,AND WE S SEE HOW MANY VIALS IT THAT THE PLUNDER COULD FAIL IN STUFF LIKE THAT AND AND FOR US IT WAS ONLY TOO BECAUSE THE VIOLES ARE LIKE THAT
229,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASE SOME MOR BATTERYIS AM LAKE LAKE THIR LAKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUNUNDE WINTS IT PICKED UP THE DEWASHESKT TWO BATTER
230,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSE URGRE UM AN T IT CONNECTS THE WASHER STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TOOK IT IT DOES
231,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINESSED THE LINE TO SEVEN O ME TO TEN ONES UM I'D JO SET BEFORE ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
232,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT ISCOVERS WHEN I PUT HER A WRAPPIN WORE OF THE WIRE ROUND IT A EAT A MORM A WASHER STICK TO IT
233,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN I PUTA HUNDRED WINDS ON  PICKED UP THE TIN WASHES BEB BEFORE THEY ONLY PICKED UP I PICKED P TON WASHES INSTEAD OF FISTIN WASHERS TO A ADDING UP A FIVE MORE
234,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,AM INCREASE WHEN I DESI A PICKED UP TO LOWER AS ONNOT PUT ER UP THE THIRTY I PICKED UP AT THE SWAIT A OPENING BUT IT TO HUNDRED WINS I HAD THESE PICKED UP THIRTY WASH
235,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,WHAT THE PRAYIN IS THERE'S ASK MUST BE ANY OPEN CIRCUNS AH A IT HAS TO BE I AIS CLOSER TO EVERYTHN
236,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO DECAILS WORK WITH THE AVERSE WEN DECELL AND HOW MUCH ENEGY IT GIVES ER GOES UP TO
237,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT ISN'T TECITY ISN'T FLUING THROUGH BECAUSE AND WE SO TURNED AROUND AN  ANDREWS HAT TO HAV E MOCKET AM IN THE POSITE PLASLET A PAN TOUCHING CHEBEN AND NOT A TURRAT MAKE THE RIFLE LIFE
238,UM IT WILL IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,AM IT'LL A ONS AS ITTLE THE LIKEULGUN SHOULDBE BRIT AND BRECULATED ARIGE TACK MIKT TA ELIT AN A BURNATA
239,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES THUS THE CIRCUIT IS ON WHAT WHEN THE WISE ARE CONNECTED TO THE DESAILD BATTY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CASONWHERE AND THE BASING
240,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WHAT I OBSERVE IS WHEN YOU A JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TO LIGHT WABS IT'LL LITTLE BE DULL AND A RO SHIBRIH BUT IF YOU HAD TWO BATTERIES IT'LL ONLY TO LIPTLUP SHAN BRIGHTER
241,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT IT WILL SHAT LOWER AND LOWER AND NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH THE BATTERY PUT THE
242,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS O HAPPENED IS H WISE NEEY TO BE CONNECTED TO THE GESAL BATTERY AND IT WHAT BUTHOFLIERS HAS TO BE ON A PASION WAR AND ON OCCASIONAL WAR
243,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,AN IT'S NO USE TO THE COLOR CAS IT IS WRENLIME IN ITS COSTPY GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
244,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,ITS OTEN BECAUSE ISPRT REFLECTING OFTEN TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND ITIFFER BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
245,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,WOR I HOWEVEFLEX OFF TO MAKE THESE KINDOF COLORS LIKE A TVIOLETA PURPLE TO BTE GRAIN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TREAD
246,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,OM WHA HAPPENS TO YOU TANS DARK GRAIN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CARD ITS WHITE IT DOES NOT RETURN SPLUE
247,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MACHANIST WAS YOUR NASSIPAS TO HAVE IN THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNITMONK MANTIKEN
248,THE MAGNET THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,SOMTHE MACNION I ME THE MACNE IS ONRABLE ON  IS UNDERD THICSTAK AND AN YOUR DISMITIN A MAGAAN PITICACASNA MATESOM CONNECTED TO
249,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT IS VANUBARELY AT ONE SPACER BREAKISTIFUL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM IS NOT RARYS TTISTICON
250,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS AND ONE CUP AND  WE PUTMACK MAGNETS AND AOTHER CUPS O SEE IT OM HOW MANY OM WASHERS A BREAK OF THE MAGNETS FALL
251,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FIRS FOR SCOLS WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MACNATS NACNET TISM A FORCE OF THE WORSE IS NOT CONNECTED TOH WHIC MAKUSA WEAKER
252,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,BUT GOING ON HERE FOM VENY PRESSPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THO MACNICET TOLLAR BUT THE RAGNICS AS THE TATCHING COTHER
253,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES A A MIXED OPRESS KIND OF WEAKER RECURAY CONSIDER BING STRUNKER HAN USUALLY THOUGH FOC
254,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,BRI NOTICE IS WEN ITS TO LESS THAN ONE'S TO LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AN THE MAGOMICA HOLLD THE PAPER
255,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT SEVERING BECAUSE IT'S LONGERAN I HAS MORE FOREST BOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET AND DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METTL AN A MUMMIN THAT KIND OF UM AH THE KIND OF A MAGNET IN EM  THAT'S ALL I HAVE
256,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE SADESS VIANE WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON TE MAGNET AND STICK INTO A PAPERCLIP IT'LL STAY ON BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF IT
257,WELL ONE IS LIKE S ONE I GUESS THERE I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER SO IT'S EASY BECAUSE IT'S STICKING THIS AND THEN IT'S TRYING LIKE THAT IT IS KIND OF LIKE WHEN,WELL BUT THE THIN ONE IS LIKE SO ONE I GUESS LERAN ONLY HAVE ONE PAPERS TO WIT EAS BECAUSE SIT'S THICK INE  NOW WELL A  A NAN I START O MICIMENT GOING LIKE THAT AND A KINDING LIKE MY
258,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE IT,WHAT IS GOING O TO THICK PECEPEAPER IS THE FOREST AT THE BLOW CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IS SO THICK AND THE THIN NCHEAT BEGINS IT SO
259,WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW MAGNETS REACT UM HOW IT COULD THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO UM IT'S SO STRONG THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH A NAIL AND HOLDS A PAPERCLIP,WE'VE LEARNED BOU HOW MAGNET'S REACT I'M HAVI KIT THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS SO OM I SO AL STRONG THAT KICKA THROU ANEOL IN ORDER TO HOLD THE PAPER
260,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISN'T A ACTING LIKE A MAGD A HLIKE WHAT A WIDE CORAPPID AROUND ELECTRICITAN CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH AND STO MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL ON REAXE LIKE A METAL
261,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,WHEN IT IS TO MAKE  ONIX TICK TO THE PAPY CLUB BET WHEN ITS NOT I CANNOT STICK TO THE PA
262,IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR,IT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SORT SNUGGLING THROUGH NAPRGRATER AM PAPER CLIPPOTET
263,ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE,I SEE IS A MAGNET AND A NAIL AND ITS FIRST KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
264,I THINK IF LIGHT BULBS CONNECT TO THE WIRES SO THE FACE BULBS IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE AS THE CASTIC IS MORE THAN,IN IFFIN WOT CONNECTED THE WISE ORDER THE BASALON IT WHAT IT REALLY WAD BECOMES THI AS TE GIZWOD
265,THE DIRECTION OF FLOW WHEN A REGISTER IT'S D CELL GET CHANGES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO OTHER DIRECTION,WIC AS THE DIRECTION OF ROW AND IT RITIS RICHISTER DESAL IED IT CHANGES TO THE NEGATIR SIDE AND DEPOSIT OF SLAVIS GOINGS EVRY DIRECTION
266,BUT I NOTICE THAT IT IS A GET THE LIGHT BULB OR LIKE INTO STORAGE YOU KNOW LIGHT UP MIGHT ENERGY,BUT I NOTICE THAT I DIDT AA GID ITH E LIGHT BOLD A RIGHT TO INSORTER TO LIGHT UF THE MIGHT THE BANAGE
267,THE BATTERY HELPS BUT THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BULB TO HELP THE LIGHTED ON IN TO REALLY IMPORT IN TO THE PARTS ACCORDING TO,THE BATRY HELPS WITH THE WIRE UM AND THE LIGHT BALL TO HAVE LIGHTED ON AND TREALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTS ABOUT IT SO
268,WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET,WHAT'S EPARTANTS OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK CURGLE THROUGH THE FROM BECAUSE IF YOU PUED THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET EP TO GET THE MAT
269,THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH,THEWIRE THE RIVER TO THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT FO THE OM ELECTRICITY AND E ENERGY COOK UP THE
270,UM THE ELECTRICITY DOES GOES THROUGH AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE FORCE ALL THE WASHERS CONNECT AND IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE,ON THE ELECTRICITY STOES GOES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FORSE OF THE FORESIRC HAPPIN CONNECTIVIT WITH ALL THE WACHES CONNECT AND TE THE GILLS TH TEPOSIT OPSIDE THROUGHOUT THE NEGATIVES
271,BECAUSE IT'S IRON OR STEEL THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND AND AND ON TO IT TO MAKE IT THAT TO GET THE MAGNETIC FORCE,BUGAS IT IRON OR STEEL SHE DE MARITE TO SUBMIT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE WIRE TO GO AROUND N N ONTO IT TO MAKE IT EMIT TO GET THE MAGNETIC WARS
272,WELL THE SWITCHING ON THE SWITCH SOMETHING HAS TO BE OF MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH SOMETHING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE,WILE THE CIRCUT OF SPITCH AT LEAST AS SOMETHING HAS TO BE PLUGGED OF A MAN NECK LEK FOR SOLVE ELECTRICIRICAL IS CO THROUSUPTEY THROUGH ANOTHER WILE
273,WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING,MASTER HAPPIN AT THE RIVER AND T E WIRE SAY SOM HE ASKED TO AT LEAST CONNECT SOMEWHAROR AT LEAST TO SOMETHING
274,WELL WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT UM WASHERS DON'T STICK TO THE THE METAL THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STICKS,WELL WHEN IT ALL BE IDETEM A WASHESTOT STICK TO THE THEE THE MEDALTINNAN ON IT CLOSER IT TIX
275,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWAGE AND THEN SGOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MET BY THE COURSE
276,MEANS IT ALREADY HAS CLOSED CIRCUIT UM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS ABLE TO UM CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS AND THE WASHERS WILL CONNECT WHEN IT'S OPEN,BENSIT WHEN IT HAS A CLOSER ONON THE MAGNETIC FORCES ABLE TO A WHAT CONECT GET THE WASHERS SAY AND THE WASHERS WELL CONNECT BUT WHEN IT OPENED IT OPEN
277,WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH,BAT THAS BEEN ITS AN OPEN CIRCU THE MAGNETIC FORCE SEM CONNECT WITH THE WATHERS BECAUSEITIT HAS NOACOMPEL IT TO THE WIRE
278,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF THE WHEN IT'S PUSHED OUTWARD NOTHING STICKS TO IT BUT WHEN IT'S SWITCHED IN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING,WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS AFTTER THING WHEN IT'S PUSHE OUTWARD ON LETTHING STICK SOP WHEN IT'S FIXED IN IT STICKS SOMETHING
279,UM WHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THE GUY HE'S LOOKING AT HIS REFLECTION AND YOU CAN STILL SEE IN THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF HOW THE MIRROR REFLECTS,E ANORNIN UM  WHEN THE LAMP IS BEHIND THA GEY HEIS A GISPLECTIONS AND YOU STILL SEE NOW ON THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF ON AR HOW REFLEX
280,WHAT'S GOING ON IS FIRST OF THE MAGNET JUST THE ONE IS LET TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE ITS START SAME IN ABSENT,OIT GOING ON IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET OSM WON I LET TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE ITS NETICE IT'S THE ASAME QUADRON ANOTHER OPS
281,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT IS SERIOUS OKAY WORKS WIRES SO AND GO GOING WHAT'S HAVE ONE WIRE AND IN THE,THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS TOOK AT OR TIS BIESS A AND GO O SOOVER STAP OW AN R W YOU HAVE ONE WIRING AN THE OGERAT CONMIDDENT MEMN
282,WHAT I THINK IT GOING ON HERE SINCE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT THE THINGS IS NOT ELSE AND THE NOTICED TO BECAUSE THE FILAMENT IT WILL BE ORDER GO TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB GIVEN ENERGY,BUT I THINK IT'S GOING ON HERE SINCE TOO LIHTBULBS I'M NOT THEIN IS RABBERY AUT IN NODE S PLANTIN ARITL TI A LIGHT UP BECAUSE A FILLIMENT WHO IT WILL BE ON INORDEN'T TO GO THROUGH THE LETTER LIKE UL FIC ETEN ENEGE
283,WE TALKED AT AND THINGS THAT STICK TILL ON MAGNET SPILLING ABOUT IRION TELL ME ABOUT IRON AND WHY JUST THIS STICK TO REFRIGERATOR AND HOW MAGNETS ARE USED,WI TALKD ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS THAT STICK TO AM MAGNETS WE LEARNT ABOUT IRON TELLING ME ABOUT IRON AND UM WHY DOES IT STICK TO A FIDRIOR AN HOW MAGNETS ARE USED
284,THE BLACK ROCK EITHER GREEN ROCK BECAUSE GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT WILL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE HAS THE SAME THING NOT IN THE OCEAN THAT STICK TO MAGNET,THE BLACK ROCK REATHER GREEN ROK BECAUSE THE GREEN ROCK I DON'T THINK IT OLL STICK BUT THE BLACK ROCK I THINK SO BECAUSE HAS A SETAINTHING NAT IN THE OCEAN TATS BLACK THAT STICKS TO MACK
285,WELL IT BECAUSE ITS STILL LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE IS NOT ELECTRICITY TO GO RUN THROUGH EACH,WIUD BECAUSE ITS TWO LIBUBS CONNECTED BY THE SAME WIRE SO THERE'S NOT ANOP ELECTRICITY TO O RUN THROUGH EACH
286,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP,WHAT'S GOING ON IS A THE BATTERIES IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIPOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM LIGHT UP
287,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND FOR HAPPENS IS RUNNING CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT HELP TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,BECAUSE WE DARE AN EXPERMENT HONOR AND FOR HARPING IN SPELLIN CONNECIOTS WI BATTERY A HELP ME O THAN I NO MIT MI N CHAN
288,WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT BULBS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH HIM AND RELATED IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE LIKE,WHAT I OBSERVE ABOUT THE BALBS ANDS THEIR ENERGIIS GOING THROUGH HIM AND I REALLY TO IT IN IT GOES BACK INTO THE BETTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO THE LIGHT
289,WHAT'S GOING ON IT GONE OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH BUT STILL USING THE SAME THING BUT NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND BY THE,WHAT'S GOING ON IT IS GOING AT THE BETTER AND THROUGH YEBUT STILL USIN THE SAY OTHING BUT THEY MADE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND ODER GELITA
290,WHAT I OBSERVE THE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I OBSERVE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THE ENERGY'S GOING THROUGH THE BETTER AND GOING TO BOTH THE LIGHT DOPS
291,WHAT I THINK WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIPULBS UM IS ITALITE BRITER AND BRITER
292,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T NOT LIGHTING WERE AND WHAT NOW ITS LIGHTING SO BRIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE,WHAT I NOTICE HAT THE LIPUB IS IN NO LIGHTING RULE WENT WHELE NOW ITS LIGHTNING S SO BRIGHT BECAUSE THERES TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED THE OPPOSITE SIDE
293,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB WHEN BACK OUT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB BACK UP,THAT'S GYING ON WITH THAT LITTLE CHESTITY IT'S GOING THROUG IS ALIGTFLE AN BACK OUT THROUGH LIGHTOUR HEAND WALKOT
294,I THINK THE CIRCUIT ONE TOP BECAUSE THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND AN XC BUT LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY BRIGHT,I SHINK THE SECOND LINE TOP BECAUSE HOUSE THERE'S A LIBOBBA AN EX SEEBLE THE LIPROTER SHINE ON REALLY BRIGT
295,OH WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB IT GIVES THE MORE ENERGY SOME MORE LIGHT BULBS YOU CAN LIGHT UP THERE IS ENOUGH NOT YOU ELECTRICITY FOR,WHAT I NOTICE IS IF YOU JUST ADD ONE BETTER TO ONE LITPULP IT GIVES AT MY ENERGY THE MORE LIPL YO LIGHT UP THEREIS NOT ENOUGH JUICE OR INDER ELECTRICITY FOR IT
296,UM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THEY WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE THEY HAD POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WOULD REPEL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD UM GO TOGETHER YES,AM SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE MAGNETS AND THERE WOULD BE SHOWING US ABOUT LIKE THA POSITIVE A NEGATIVE SIDE SO IT'S LIKE A NEGATIVE IT WOULD PUSH AWAY FROM IT IT WERE TO REPEL AND IF IT WAS POSITIVE IT WOULD UMGO TOGETHER YES
297,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEY'LL REPEL IF IT THEY'RE LIKE NORTH AND NORTH THEY REPEL AND IF THEY'RE SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL,SO IF THEY'RE THE SAME ONES THEY'LL REPEL IFTHEY'RE LIKES I NORTH AND NORTH THEY'LL REPEL AND IS THEYRE SOIN SOTING COMMENTES REPEL
298,YEAH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT UM THEY ALL GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THERE AND DOWN AGAIN THROUGH THE WIRE,YAH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AM THEY ALL GO THROUGH THE BASE AND UP THERE AND DOWN AGAIN THROUGH THE WIRE
299,YEAH THEY'RE ATTRACTING SO THEY HOOK TOGETHER EXCEPT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY HOOK TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S UM THE TABLE IS IN FRONT OF IT,HER EXAMPLETHEYARE ATTRACTING SO THEY HOOK TOGETHER EXCEPT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY HOOK TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S ON THE TABLE IS IN FRONT OF IT
300,UM THE WIRES ARE USED FOR CONNECTING ON THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BASE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO GIVE IT LIKE POWER,OF THE WIRES ARE USED FOR CONNECTING ON THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BASE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIPALB TO GIVE IT LIKE POWER
301,UH WELL THERE IS THE FILAMENT WHICH IT GETS WARM AND IT LIGHTS UP CAUSE IT THE LIGHT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH TO LIGHT IT UP,AH WELL THERE IS THE FILAMENT WHICH IT GETS WARM AND IT LIGHTS UP CUSE IT THE LIGHT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH TO LIGHT IT UP
302,THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES SO YOU'RE GONNA CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THE BATTERY TO LIGHT TO LIGHT THEM UP,THERE IS A TWO LIGHT BALBS AND WIRES  SAYU GO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BALBS IN THE BATTERY TO LIGHT TO LIGHT THEM UP
303,UM SO THE MAGNET THE MAGNETIC ELESIS ELECTRICITY WILL BE FL FLOWING THROUGH THE NAIL AND IT CAN PICK THE PAPER CLIP UP,AM SO THE MAGNET THE MAGNATICALELECTRICITY WILL BE FLOWING THROUGH THE NAIL AND IT CAN PICK THE PAPER CLIB UP
304,BECAUSE ON THIS ONE THE POSITIVE SIDE IS WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE BASE AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND THIS ONE N THERE'S BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTING IT'S THE ONE WE JUST DID WHERE THERE'S A CIRCUIT,BECAUSE ON THIS ONE THE POSITIVE SIDE IS WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE BASE AND THEN THEREIS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND THIS ONE THERE IS BOTH POSITIVE NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTING ITS THORM WEJULL STOOD WHERE THERE IS THE CIRCUIT
305,UM THAT THE POWER OF THE BATTERY IS PUSHING IT THROUGH THERE UP INTO THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AGAIN AND GOING THROUGH THERE AND THEN LIKE REUSING THE POWER,AM THAT THE POWER OF THE BATTERY IS PUSHING IT THROUGH THERE UP INTO THE FILAMENTS AND DOWN AGAIN AND GOING THROUGH THERE AND THEN LIGHTREUSING THE POWER
306,UH IT'S SHOWING IF YOU CONNECT UM ONE WIRE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE RIGHT THERE THAT IT'LL UM IT WON'T MAKE IT LIGHT UP SO YOU'LL HAVE TO HOOK THE OTHER WIRE UP T TO THE UM BOTTOM OF IT TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,I DOIN AT SHOWING IF YOU CONNECT ON ONE WHARE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND HOOK IT UP TO THE BASE RIGHT THERE THAT ITALL N IT WON'T MAKE A LIGHT UP SO YOU'LL HAVE TO HOOK THE OTHER WIRE UP TO THE BOTTOM OF IT TO MAKE A LIGHT UP
307,WELL YES IT CAN MAGNETISM CAN GO THROUGH THINGS UM UM IF I TAKE TWO MAGNETS THIS IS WHAT I OBSERVED I TAKE TWO MAGNETS AND I HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER OR CARDBOARD I S PUT THEM TOGETHER AND THEY STICK,WELL YES IC MAGNETISM CAN GO THROUGH THINGS UM UM IF I TAKE TWO MAGNETS THIS IS WHAT I OBSERVED A I TAKE TWO MAGNETS AND A PIECE OF PAPER OR A CARBOARD I PUT THUMP TOGETHER AND TA STICK
308,WHEN THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL THE MAGNET BECOMES A TEMPORARY MAGNET SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK TO THE NAIL,WHEN THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL THE MAGNET BECOMES A TEMPORARY MAGNET STO THE MAGNETIC FORCEIS GONE THROUGH THE NAIL AND MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK TO THE NAIL
309,UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU FLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES THEM APART,UM THE MAGNET FORTS BETWEEN THEM IF YOU FLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRY TO PUSH THEM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHUSTHEM APARP
310,WELL BECAUSE UM THE BECAUSE THE MAGNET CAN ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE OTHER METALS IT CAN'T REALLY STICK TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY METAL IT'S LIKE COPPER ALUMINUM FOIL,WELL BECAUSE UM TH BECAUSE THE MAGNET CAN ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEALE BECAUSE OTHER METALS O CAN'T REALLY STICK TOO BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY METAL IT'S LIKE COPPER LIMINUM BOIL
311,THE MAGNET FORCE ISN'T MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S UM IN BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD,THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S AM AND BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD
312,THE MAGNET FORCE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PENCIL UM THERE ISN'T MUCH MAGNET FORCE BUT IN THE MIDDLE THERE'S A LOT OF MAGNET FORCE AND THEN AT THE TOP THERE'S MORE MAGNET FORCE,THE MAGNET FORCE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PENCIL UMS THERE ISN'T MUCH MAGNETFORCE BUT IN THE MIDDLE THERE'S A LOT OF MAGNET VOICE AND  AT THE TOP THEREIS THEMORE MAGNET FORCE
313,WELL FOR THE RIVET TO ACT LIKE A MAGNET IS FOR EITHER WIRE WRAPPED AROUND IT YEAH WIRE WRAPPED AROUND IT FOR IT TO WORK,OR FOR THE RIVERT TO ACT LIKE A MAGNET IS FOR EITHER WHY YOURE WRAPPED AROUND IT YES WHY WRAPPED AROUND IT FOR IT TO WORK
314,WELL THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY CAN WORK WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KINDA CONNECT TO,WELL THE FULL OF ELECTRICTY CAN WORK WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSE BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KINDED CONNECT TO
315,WELL ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE BATTERY AND THEN THE SWITCH BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SWITCH YOU COULDN'T TURN ON AND OFF AND IT WOULD RUN THE BATTERY OUT AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BATTERY IT WOULDN'T WORK,WELL ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTENT IS THE BATTERY AND THE SWITCH BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SWITH YOU COULDN'T TURN ON AND OFF AND IT WOULD RUN THE BATTERY OUT AND IF YO DIDN'T HAVE A BATTERY IT WOULDN'T WORK
316,WELL FOR THE FIRST ANSWER THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET AND WHAT'S UP WITH THAT IS THAT WHEN IT'S WRAPPED AROUND IT CAN PICK UP ME METAL OBJECTS,FOR THE FIRST DANCER THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVED AND WHAT'S UP WITH THAT IS THAT WHEN IT'S WRAPPED AROUND IT CAN PICK UP MET METAL OBJECTS
317,THAT THERE'S ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND ONE SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY,THATHERE'S ONE LONG WIRE CONDUCTING TO THE SWITCH IN THE BATTERY AND ONE'S SHORT WATER CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH IN THE BATTERY
318,WELL IF IT FLOWS THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND INTO THE POSITIVE THEN AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN,ELL IT COUL FOL SOME INNEGUTEN INTO DEPOSITED EVIDENT AND THERE GOES THROUGH THE DECAIL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN
319,UM I NOTICED THAT THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT HAS THE LIGHT BULB SHINING WHICH ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT DOESN'T HAVE A LIGHT BULB SHINING IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE SHARING WIRES,UM I NOTICE THAT THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT HAS THE LIPLUP SHINING WHICH ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT DOESN'T HAVE A LIEPUP SHINING IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S SHARING WIRES
320,WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM A NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE WELL IT'S FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND INTO POSITIVE AND IT'S GOING IN A CIRCUIT,WHILE THE LECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE WELL IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE INTO THE LIPTBALVE OUT TO THE LIPTBLVE AN INTO POSITIVE AND ITS GOING ON A CIRCUIT
321,WELL ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T BRIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT,WELL ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BALBS AREN'T BRIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT
322,IT TELLS ME THAT ONE HEN IS IS LIKE HET HE MORE BIGGER SO IT HOLDS HOLDS LESS AND THE OTHER HOLDS LIKE MORE ER THAN THE THE GROUP ONE,IT TELLS ME THAT ONE AND IS IT'S LIKE HE MORE BEGGAR SO WIT HOLDS HOLDS LIS IN THE OTHER HOLDS OLDS LIKE MORE  THAN THE A GRUP ON
323,UM THEY CONNECT BECAUSE IT'S CAUSE WHEN IT GETS TO ONE THOUSAND THOUSAND AND ONE AND HUNDRED HUNDRED AND TWO TH ONE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED THEN ONE THOUSAND IT'S H ALL MILLILITERS HERE'S,AM THEN EGE BECAUSE ER IS IT AS WHEN IT GET SEVEN THOUSAND HOWSAN AM NOT AND HUNDRED INDRED INTO ONE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED HUNDRED THEN ONE THOUSAND IS AT ALL OL MILL LEADERS HEERS
324,I OBSERVED WAIT I OBSERVED THAT THAT LIKE EACH ONE AND LIKE ONE IS LIKE SMALLER AND AND THE TWO LIKE IF THE CYLINDER ILINDER WITH THE HOLDING HOLDING IN THE BUCKET THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE SO THEY HOLD THE SAME ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER,I OBSERVE WEL I OBSERVE FIRE HAT LIKE EACH ONE AND LIKE ONE IS LIKE SMALLER IN IN THE TWO LIKE THE CYLRUNDER HLUNDER WITH THE HOLDING HOLDING IN THE BUFKET O THE SAME SIZE SO THEY O THE ING ALMOS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATLE
325,UM WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER WATER AND AND LIKE UM AND LIKE SPONGES SPONGE DRY SPONGES AND WET SPONGES SPONGES AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING ING LOT'S OF OTHER STUFF THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF,WE'VE BEEN MUG BRING WATER HATER AND AND LIKE EM AND LIKE PONCES HUNGES DRY SPONCES AND WET SPONCES UNGES AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING IN LOTS OF OTHER STUFF THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF
326,THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WATER IS LIGHTER THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WITH SALT IN IT BECAUSE THE SALT MAKES THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER HEAVIER,THE FIFTEY MIRE UATERS OF WATER WATER IS LIGHTER THAN THE FIFTEEN MIRLATORS OF WATER WITH SALT IN IT BECAUSE THE SALT MAKES TH FIFTEE MILATES OF WATER HEAVIER
327,THAT IS CALLED SATURATION WHICH IS WHEN WHEN YOU PUT UM TOO MUCH SOLID AND SOLUTION WHEN SO IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE,THAT IS CALLED SATURATION WHICH IS WHEN WHEN YOU PUT AM TOO MUCH SOLID SOLUTION WHEN SO IT DOESN'T DISSOL
328,THE EPSOM SALT IS A SPIKY NEEDLED NEEDLED ONE THE SALT IS THE SQUARED ONE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE CITRIC ACID IS A CLEAR WHITE,THE ABSEN SALL IS THE SPIKIN NEEDLED NEEDLED AM ONE THE SALL IS THE SQUARE ONE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE SICTURE AFTIT IS A FAST CLEARER WHITE CREST
329,THAT THE ONE I CLICKED ON RIGHT NOW IS CITRIC ACID NO THIS IS THIS ONE IS CITRIC ACID THIS ONE IS SALT AND THIS ONE IS EPSOM SALT,THAT THE ONE I CLICKED ONE RIGHT NOW IS CETRIC ACID NOW THIS IS THIS ONE OF EXTRIC ACIT THIS ONE IS SALT AND THIS ONE IS ABSENT SALT
330,WE CAN WEIGH WE CAN PUT WEIGHT IN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF NORMAL WATER AND THEN HOWEVER HOWEVER MANY THINGS IT WEIGHS ON THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SOLIDITY CHART AND IT HAS SUBSTANCE ONE IN IT SO,WE CAN WEIGH WE CAN PUT WEIGHT IN THE FIFTEEN MILL YEARS OF NARMAL WATER AND THEN HOWE FEVIT HOWEVER MANY THINGS IT WEIGHS UNCE THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE CC SOLIBERTY CHART AND A SUBSTANT ONE IN IT SOM
331,THE THE LIGHTER ONE IS IS ON THE TOP AND THE AND THE HEAVIER ONE GOES TO THE BOTTOM EXCEPT IF YOU PUT THEM IN,THE THE LATER ONE IS ON IS ON THE TOP AND THE AND THE HEAVIER ONE GOS TO THE BOTTOM EXCEST IF YOU PUT THEM IN N
332,THAT THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN FIVE GRAMS SOLUTION B IS LESS DENSE I MEAN SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE THAN FIVE GRAMS AND SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE,THAT THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN FIVE GRAMS SOLUTION B IS LESS DENSE AIN SOLUTION E S LESS TENSE THAN FIVE GRAMS THA SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE
333,THE UM SALT UM DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND IT'S STILL PART OF THE WATER IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S STILL IN THE WATER,THE UM SALT UM DISSOLVE THEM TO THE WATER IN ITS STILL PART OF THE WATER ITS INPORT INT BECAUSE IT'S STILL IN THE WATER
334,I THINK THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MIX IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DOES,I THINK THE SANDIN WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MIX IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE SAL AND WATER MIXTURE DOES
335,I THINK THE UM SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE SAND AND AND WATER MIXTURE BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T,I THINK THE UM SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS DIFFERENT THEM THE AND AND WATER MIXTURE BEAS THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T
336,ONE OF THEM IS MORE IN SOLUTION A THE FIVE GRAMS IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND IN SOLUTION B THE FIVE GRAMS IS LESS THAN THE WATER SOLUTION A MUST HAVE SOMETHING SOME SOLUTION B MUST HAVE SOMETHING ADDED TO IT,ONE OF THEM IS MORE IN SOLUTION A THE FIVE GRAMS IS MORE DENSIL THAN THE WATER AN IN SOLUTION B THE FIVE GRAMS IS LESS TENSI THAN THE WATER SOLUTION A MUST HAVE SOMETHING SOME SOLUTION B MUST HAVE SOMETHING ADDED TO IT
337,BECAUSE THE THE LIGHTER SOLUTION TRIES TO GO UP TO THE TOP BUT IT IT IT AND THAT IT MIXES TOGETHER WITH THE HEAVIER SOLUTION,BECAUSE THE UM THE LIGHTER SOLUTION TRIES TO GO UP TO THE TOP BUT IT IT IN THAT IT MAXES US TOGETHER WITH THE HEAVIER SLU
338,BECAUSE YOU BECAUSE THE THE LESS DENSE ONE GOT PUT IN FIRST WHEN IT TRIES TO FLOAT UP TO THE TOP THE THE DENSER ONE AND IT MIXES TOGETHER,BECAUSE YOU BECAUSE THE UM THE LAST DANCE ONE GOT PUT IN FIRST AND WHEN IT TRIES TO FLOAT UP TO THE TOP THE THAN THE DANCER ONE AND IT MIXE TOGETHER
339,THE LESS DENSE ONE WAS PUT IN FIRST AND THE MORE DENSE ONE WAS PUT IN LAST SO THEY MIXED TOGETHER,THE LESS THENCE ONE WAS PUT IN FIRST AND THE MORE THA ONE WAS PUT IN LAST SO THEY MIXED TOGETHER
340,THE THE PENNY IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER AND I MEAN THE THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER SO IT FLOATS,THE UM THE PENNY IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER AND I MEAN THE THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER SO IT FLOATS
341,BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID EARLIER I KNOW LOOK I'M NOT HOLDING MY SPACE BAR AND IT'S STILL ON IT'S,BAKIN PHODA AND TELL SAM CHLORIT THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID EARLIER I KNOW TEKEN TEGEN TEKEN BUK I'M NOT HOLDING MY SPACE BAR AND IT'S SO ON IT'S
342,THAT THE REACTANTS HAVE HAVE WHITE AND ALL DIFFERENT COLORS IN IT AND THEY MIX TOGETHER AND AND IN THE PRODUCT AND MAKE DIFFERENT COLORS,A DEARY ACT TENS HAVE A HAVE AWAY AND ALL DIFFERENT COLORS IN AND THEY MIX TOGETHER AND AND IN THE PRODUCT AND MAKE DIFFERENT COLORS
343,THAT IS A HARDNESS SCALE ABOUT HOW HARD ROCKS ARE YEAH AND MINERALS MINERAL MINERAL I'M SMART OKAY GIVE ME A GOOD GRADE,THAT IS A HARDNESS SCALE ABOUT HOW THE HARD ROCK SARE YA AND MINERALS MINERAL METALMER I'V SMART E GA ME AGREAD
344,ONE IS LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE BECAUSE THE ONE THAT IS HEAVIER COLLECTED GAS AND THE ONE THAT IS LIGHTER DIDN'T,ONE IS LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE BECAUSE THE ONE THAT IS HEAVIER COLLECTED GAS IN ONE THAT IS LIGHTER DEAD
345,MMM HMM LIKE UM WE HAVE RUBBER BANDS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA DO LIKE THREE RUBBER BANDS AND THEY THINK THAT IT'LL BE IN LESS LINES FOR THE PROPELLER,M LIKE OM WE HAVE AR BANDS AND SOME PEEPARGAIN A YO LIKE THREE REBBER MANS AND THEY THINK THAT IT'LL BEIN LESS WINES FOR THE PROPELLER
346,MAYBE IT'S CAUSE YOU WOULD GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER LIKE IF YOU DID MASS WAIT IF YOU DID LIKE RUBBER BANDS AND FORCE FOR THE FAN MAYBE IT YOU WOULDN'T GET THE SAME ANSWER AS YOU WOULD JU FOR JUST THE FAN OR JUST THE RUBBER BANDS,MAYBE IT'S CAUSE YOU WOULD GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER LIKE IF YOU DIDN'T MASS BUT IF YOU DID LI RUBBER BAND AND FORCE FOR THE FAN MAYBE IF WEU WOULDN'T GET THE SAME ANSWER AS WOULD YPURJUST THE FAN OR JUST THE RUBBER BANN TO GO I
347,UM WE'VE BEEN JUST LIKE A LOT TIMES WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES HALFWAY AND HOW FAR IT GOES ALL THE WAY AND WITHOUT IT LIKE WE DID LIKE EIGHTY TWO AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY BUT IT THEN IT BOUNCED OFF THE CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THEN WE TRIED SIXTY AND THAT HAD A LITTLE BOUNCE AND THEN WE TRIED FIFTY TWO AND THAT WAS PERFECT IT LIKE STOPPED RIGHT AT THE CHAIR,UM WE'VE BEEN JUST LIKE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN'VE BEEN SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES HALF WAY AND HOW FAR IT GOES ALL THE WAY AND WITHOUT IT LIKE WE DID LIKE EIGHTY TWO AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY BUT I THEN I BOUNCED OFF THE CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT WE TURNED SIXTY AND THAT HAD A LITTLE BALANCE IN THE RECHIRE FIFTY TWO AN THAT WAS PERFECT YOU LIKE STOPPED RIGHT AT THE CHAIR
348,YEAH UM WE LIKE HOW WE MADE IT WE TOOK UM FISHING LINE THE REALLY STRONG STUFF AND UM WE DUCT TAPED IT TO A CHAIR OF FOUR METERS AND THEN WE TAPED IT TO ANOTHER CHAIR AND THEN WE ATTACHED OUR PLANE UM TO THE FISHING LINE AND UM OUR PLANE IS MADE OUT OF STRAWS LIKE DRINKING STRAWS UM AND RUBBER BANDS AND UH POPSICLE STICKS AND WHEN WE WIND IT UP UM MY GROUP ENDE MY GROUP AND I WE GOT SIXTY AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY LIKE IT GOES BY ITSELF WITHOUT US T T TOUCHING IT OTHER THAN WINDING IT AND THE IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CHAIR,YAH UM WE LIKE HOW WE MADE IT WE TOOK UM FISHING LINE THOROUGHLY STRONG STUFF AND DU WE DOC TAPED IT TO A CHAIR OF FOUR METERS AND THEN WE TAPED IT TO ANOTHER CHAIR AND THEN WE ATTACHED OUR PLAIN UM TO THE FISHING LINE AND UM OUR PLAN IS MADE OUT OF STRAWS LIKE DRINKING STRAWS UM AND RUBBER BANDS AND  POP SKLESTICKS AND WHEN WE WIND IT UP UM MY GROUP INTO MY GROUP AND I WE GOT SIXTY AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY LIKE IT GOES BY ITSELF WITHOUT US TOUCH TO TOUCHING IT OTHER THAN WINDING IT AND THE IT GOES ON THE WIY DOWN TO THEM A THEIR CHAIR
349,LIKE WE WE HAD TO DO WE HA WE GUESSED LIKE FOR MAYBE IF YOU HAVE FIFTEEN AND THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE IT JUST STAYED IN IT'S PLACE SO ONE REALLY BIG VARIABLE IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER FOR THE PLANE,LIKE WE WE HAD TO DO WE  WE GUESSED LIKE FOR MAY  FIFTEEN AND THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE IT JUST STAYED IN ITS PLACE SO ONE REALLY BIG VARIABLE IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU SPIN THE PROPELLER FOR THE PLAN
350,TO IF EVERYONE WAS DOING LIKE THE SAME VARIABLE IT WOULD TAKE A LONGER TIME TO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF EVERYBODY DID THE SAME VARIABLE AND THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES SO I GUESS IT'S UH,TILL IF EVERY ONE WAS DOING LIKE THE SAME VARIABLE IT WOULD TAKE A LONGER TIME TO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF EVERYBODY DID THE SAME VARIABLE AND THERE'RE SO MANY VARIABLES SO I GUESS I SALAASTE AS
351,YEAH WE GET FISHING LINE AND WE DECK LIKE WE GET A PIECE OF DUCT TAPE AND WE LIKE PUT IT RIGHT HERE AND IT'S LIKE UM IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE CHAIRS TOGETHER IT SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE VERY SPREAD APART SO IT'S LIKE REALLY TIGHT AND THEN WE PUT OUR PLANE ON RIGHT UM RIGHT BEFORE WE PUT ON THE DUCT TAPE AND WE UM,YET WE GET FISHING LINE AND WE DECK LIKE WE GET IT HE SAID DECK TAPE RELY PUT IT RIGHT HERE AND ITSAT OM IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE CHERUS TOGETHER IT SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE VERY SPIRT APART SO AS LIKE WELLY TIPE AND THEN WE PUT OUR PLANE ON RIGHT ON RIGHT BEFORE WE PUT ON THE DECK TAPE AND WE OM
352,UH MMM CAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO ONE AT A TIME MMM A CA AND UH EACH TABLE GROUP IS A DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KINDA COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY THAT,A CAUSE I THINK WERE GON ADO WEN A A TIME AT  AND A EACH TABLE GROUP IS A DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KIND IT COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY  A
353,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHAIRS AND DUCT TAPED EM AND OUR WE WINED UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WAIT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASS ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES,UM WE'VE BEEN IM GETTING FISH WA WE'VE GOTTEN FISHLINE CHAIRS AND DECK TAPE DOMAN AREN'T WE WIND UP THE PLANE WITH THE PAIRFELLERS AND A RABBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND DUM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND ON THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WHAT ONE OF THE VARABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FOREST THE MASTS ON HOWFAST THE PLAIN GOS
354,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN RIDE IT DOWN
355,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO AT THE TOP OF THE POD AND THEN ARE GONNA GO DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF GOING DOWN LIKE UM MAYBE LIKE IN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING IS AT,YA M SOME PEOPLEAR N LIKE FOR SLOPE OM SOME PEOPLER DONT GO AT TH TOP OF THE PAN AND EN MARGRA TO GO DOWN STEP AND THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND A JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT A IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IN HAVEA A VERY WELL CHANCE OF COME DOWN LIKE A MAY BE LIKE AN ABOUT FIVE LIK TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE TE STREAM IS THAT
356,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE A TWENTY MAYBE LIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP,WERE EXPECTING IT TOO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE AN TWENTY MAYBE UNLIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT WILL HELP
357,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,WELL UM BECAUSE UH WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALF WAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINSE DOES A PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY
358,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,WOO SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALF WAY AND ALL THE WAY AND DUM SOMETIMES WHEN WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLAINGOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE ARM CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN LIKE CAT
359,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,YA LIKE I WON'T IT IT I PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER WHEN MA A OBLET LIKE UM TO WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR I PLANED ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO WINES AND THE SHIN WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO SPEND WAR
360,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TOO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN A I MAY HAVE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT ONE ISAT THE WHOLE UR AD
361,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,UH WELL A WE ARE CHOOSING ONE VERIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND DUMB OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO A MISSMOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MANY FANS AND WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER
362,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WELL LIKE MY YUM THE MT GREW BRIGHT IN FRONT AN WE THEY DID AM THREE MAT THEY DID ONE SENDIY MEANER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THA WHAT YOU MEAN WERE COMPARING THE
363,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO A ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND INE DID FIVE INCH AND OF THE CUP UH AND FIVE INCHES AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS A WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS A A YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE IT WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SIXCESFUL
364,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OUR JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO TO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER RD AND THES WE STARTED PUTTING IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE SEN O METERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AND THE FOR FIVE INCHES OF THE SENTIMETERS AND UM
365,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,THEY WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TIE TAN YOU DO YOU KNOW ON THE TI TANIC THAT THEI LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD A MORE PASSENGERS MAY BE THAN A REGULAR CRUIS BOAT CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REAL A BIG CRUW SHIP
366,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNY IS JUST TOOF ASLEY WE PUC WE TRY TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN LET GO TO THE SIDE
367,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASHED PENNIES AND SO U WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
368,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,AM WOR AR CHIMINIS I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WERE KIND OF A QUESTING AM HOW HE FIGURED OUT AM LIKE COWBOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WE WITH THE MASS WITH THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HAWVOT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK
369,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,UH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT AND OUR BIN ITS LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UH AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS AND THREE THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE
370,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,FOK AWELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFE BOAT WAS WE TOOK THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT I AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STEADY TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND ICE A THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL AT O ONE SIDE IT WAS GOING TO SINK EVEN FASTER SO
371,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CREWS BOAT M LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE IS A TA IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT A GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT U THE PEOPLE  COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A GAGILIANT TIMES BIGGER SO
372,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YO HAE E THREE THE FOR THE THREE  WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WAY TO PUT IT UP HIERRE BUT WHELN WE HAD THE SQORDER GUN THORRY OH WHEN WE HAD THE SQORDER GUN WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO AS LIKE DOWN HERE DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREES DOWN HERE DOWN HERE AND SO WE STUCKED IT OLLP WHEN WE PUT IT IN A TEST TO
373,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,A GOOD WE GOT MORE THEN THE ONE'S LEDGE STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SANK TO THE SIDE AND
374,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCEIS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANT TO PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT IS BIG SARTA
375,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT,WEL  EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO  EVERYBODY JUST IT THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YA SOME PEOPLE GOT
376,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT IS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I GUESS NIGHT WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES
377,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MMM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBE TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK,WO THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLE LEADERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN  LIKE TEST TOB TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLA LEADERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLA LEADERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK
378,W WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THAT MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE,WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THEMY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KIND I DID LIKE MAY BE A MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TAILT A LITTLE
379,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UH ONE TO FIVE INCHES THAT YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND,A OL IN CLASSPIAV LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATERCRUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING A ONE TO FIVE INCHES YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP A MIN AND ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MATTER F PASSENGERS AND
380,WE THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TWO Y WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND,WHIC THIS IS KIND OF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TOO WHEN THEYRE HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THER A WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND
381,UH OF THE CUP OF THE COFFEE UH HUH AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUB OF WATER EACH UH PERSON GOT WITH YOUR PARTNER AND SO WE GOT A CUP OF PENNIES AND WE JUST INDIVIDUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIFE BOAT CUP AND UM SO THEN WE BASICALLY JUST DROPPED EM IN AND MY PARTNER'S KINDA WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINK THAT'S BECAUSE MORE OF THE MASS WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDE SO THAT IT WAS SINKING MORE SO IF WE WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY PENNIES IT WOULD EVEN IT OUT WELL IT DID AND THEN WE KEPT PUTTING MORE LIKE IN THE CENTER HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE KNEW THAT THAT LAST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS UM THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LIFEBOAT,OF THE CUP OF THE CUP UH AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUB OF WATER EACH A PERSON GOT WITH YOUR PARTNER AND SO WE GOT A CUP A PENNIS AND WE JUST INDIVIDUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIFE BOAT CUP AND UM SO THEN WE BESICLY JUST DROPPED A MIN IN MY PARTNER AS IN CINNA WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINK THUS BECAUSE MORE OF THE MASS WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDE SO IT WAS SINKING MOR SO IF WE WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WITH THERE WASN'T ANY PENNIES IT WOULD EVEN IT OUT WELL IT DID AND THEN WE KEPT PUTTING MORE LIKE IN THE CENTR HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE KNEW THAT THAT LAST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS A THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LIFE BOAT
382,UM WELL W THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT AND THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE,UM WELL THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT IN THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE
383,WELL UM WE W FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER WAIT NO EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST,WELL UM WE FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID AT THIRTY EIGHT SENT A METER UENO EVERYBODY DID THREE CENT METERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST
384,E I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO,I I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT IAD TO DO DOWN HERE SO
385,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECI WELL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PENDULUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND IT W AND WHAT WE UH FOUND OUT IS W NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,UH WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH IN THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECITE AND WERE WE STARTED UH TO PUT THE PEDDILUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND AND WHAT WE OT FOUND OUT IS NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
386,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER,UM WILL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASTS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENTULUM DOES NOT MATTER
387,MMM HMM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER E WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE,WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE A NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLE STARTED TO CHANGE
388,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YOU ULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE
389,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHITE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO BY ONE BY ONE UM WITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHITEBOARD AND A WELL IT WAS LIKE O IT WAS LIKE WANT TWO THREE FOR FIVE ALL THEA A TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO ONE BY ONE AM WHAT THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE
390,YEAH UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN M UH WE DECIDED TO USE ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO,YA UM EVERYBODY UVES THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN AH WE DECIDED OU TO USE ONE OF OUR STRAGEDIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO
391,WELL W WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON A STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY UH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIOUS OF TIMES,WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY INCH UM PENDULUMS WAN STRING PAPER CLUP AN PENNY AH AND TO EVERYBODY JUSTID AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY UNTED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FUR UM VARIOUS OF TIMES
392,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO  EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT ON LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND OM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE
393,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS,WELL UM WERE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS
394,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TWO I THINK THREE FOUR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LINE DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND UH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TO I THINK THREE FOR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LYING DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE
395,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU'VE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY SWINGS YOU GOT,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU HAVE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY SINGS YOU GOT
396,WELL I THINK THAT UM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IT TAKES UM MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH ONE CYCLE THAN UH THAN THE TWENTY TH THE MINE THE THIRTEEN INCH JUST HAS A FEW LIKE ONE TWO AND THAT WOULD BE A SWING,WELL I THINK THAT ON TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IT TAKES A MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH ONE CYCLE THAN UP THAN  THE TWENTY THE MINE THE THIRTEEN INCH JUST HAS A FEW LA ONE TOO AND THAT WOULD BE A SWING
397,WELL ONCE WE HUNG THEM ON THE BOARD WE GOT A KINDA PACKET THING WITH THE Y AXIS WITH THE Y AXIS AND THE X EX AXIS AND IT WAS JUST WAIT,WOL ONCE WE HUNG TEM ON THE BOARD WE GOT A KIND OF PACKET THING WITH THE WIXA WITH THE WI EXCESS AND THE EX EX EXCESS AND IT WAS JUST WAT
398,FIFTEEN SECONDS WELL NO BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAD MORE TIME I WOULD GET MORE AND THE LENGTH THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD GET MORE SO I GUESS THE TIMING DOES NOT MATTER YOU WOULD JUST LIKE MAYBE ADD ANOTHER TWENTY TWO OR ANOTHER FIVE SWINGS,FIFTEEN SECONDS WELL NO BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAD MORE TIME I WOULD GET MORE AN THE LENGTH THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN WOULD GET MORE SO I GUESS THE TIMING DOES NOT MATTER YOU WOULD JUST LIKE MEBE ADD ANOTHER TWENTY TWO OR ANOTHER FIVE SPHINX
399,WELL THE LONGEST ONE WE HAVE IS TWO FIFTEEN UH CENTIMETERS AND THAT ONE ONLY WELL I SHOULD SAY THE VERY LONGER ONES OR EVEN THE LONG ONES DON'T GET AS MUCH AS THE SHORTER ONES,WELL THE LONGEST ON WE HAVE IS TWO FIFTEEN A CENIMETERS AND THAT ONE ONLY WILL I SHOULD STAY THE VERY LONGER ONES OR EVEN THE LONG ONES DON'T GET AS MUCH AS THE SHORTER ONES
400,WELL LIKE I GUESS EVERYBODY MOVED AROUND THE ROOM AND WE BASICALLY UH LIKE EVERYBODY TIED IT TO THEIR DESK EXCEPT FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BUT SINCE I HAD UH THIRTEEN I TIED MY PENCIL TO THE DESK I PUT IT AROUND RIGHT HERE AND IT JUST KEPT ON SWINGING V UM A LOT MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS,WOLL LIKE I GUESS EVERYBODY MOVED AROUND THE ROOM AND WE BASICALLY A LIKE EVERYBODY TIED IT TO THEIR DESK EXCEPT FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BUT SINCE IHAD A THIRTEEN I TIED MY PENCIL TO THE DESK I PUT IT ROUND RIGHT HERE AND IT IS KEPT ON SWINGING A A LOT MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
401,WELL LIKE OUR TEACHER SAYS WE CAN'T JUST LIKE IF THIS IS OUR SWINGER AND IT WENT LIKE THIS ONE ONE SWING WOULD BE ONE SO THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE THING,WELL LIKE OUR TEACHER SAYS WE CAN'T JUST LIKE IF THIS AS OUR SWINGER AND IT WOULD LIKE THIS ONE ONE SWING WOULD BE ONE SO THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE THING
402,WELL IT'S LIKE OF COURSE THE PERSON WHO HAD MORE TIME WOULD GET MORE SWINGS UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND WAIT IF UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY GET THE SAME,WELL IT'S LIKE OF COURSE THE PERSON WHO HAD MORE TIME WOULD GET MORE SWINGS UNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND WAIT IFUNLESS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND FIFTEEN THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY GET THE SAME
403,WELL WE H WE ATTACHED A PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AT THE END OF THE PENDULUM AND I UH WE PUT THE PENNY IN THERE AND AFTER WE DID IT AFTER A FEW TIMES UM WE ALL WANTED TO TRY IT WITH UH TWO MORE PENNIES AND WE UH SOME KIDS DID IT DOWN HERE SOME KIDS WENT UP HERE BUT IT STILL ENDED UP AS ELEVEN TWELVE OR MAYBE THIRTEEN,WELL WE WE ATTACHED THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AT THE END OF THE PENDULUM AND I WE PUT THE PENNY IN THERE AND AFTER WE DID IT AFTER A FEW TIMES AM WE ALL WANTED TO TRY IT WITH A TWO MORE PENNIES AND WE A SOME KISDIN DOWN HERE SOME KITS WIP IT UP HERE BUT IT STILL UNDERED UP AS ELEVEN TWELVE OR MAY BE THIRTEEN
404,THAT WELL THE TWO HUN AND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KINDA JUST GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING,THAT WELL THE TWO HUNDR AND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KI JUST GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING
405,I GUESS IT IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TWO OR ONE TWO THREE FOUR THE THE WHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE,I GUESS IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TO OR WANT TO THREE FOR THE THE WHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT AN NA MORE
406,YEAH LIKE IF IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE WAIT IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I JUST DID ONE TWO UM THEN THE LONGER STRING WOULD MOST LIKELY GET UM THE MOST AMOUNT,YA LIKE IF IF THE LONGER STRING DID ONE WAIT IT'S LONGER CHAIN THAN ONE TO THREE FOR AND I JUST DID ONE TO A THEN THE LONGER STRING WOULD MOST LIKELY GET A THE MOST AMOUNT
407,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMENERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
408,UM MMM HMM WE HAD TO DO UH SORRY UM WE HAD TO S WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES I GUESS AND OUR FIRST ONE WAS WE HAD TO DO FOUR FLIPS ON SIX CENTIMETERS VERY BY TO THE S KINDA SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THEN WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND THEN WE DID TWO THEN ONE,OH WE HAD TO DO AN SORRY A WE HAD TO WE HAD TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT SDAGES I GUESS IN OUR FIRST ONE BE HAD TO DO FOUR OR FLETS O AN SIX CENTIMENERS VERY CLOSE TO THE SKIND OF SQUARE OBJECT RIGHT THERE AND THAT WE DID FIVE AND THEN WE DID FOUR AND THEN WE DID THREE AND T EN WE DID TWO ANAN
409,UM WE TOOK A FLIPPER UM LIKE UH LIKE LIKE IN THE OLDEN DAYS YOU KNOW HOW STUFF FLINGS LIKE A CATAPULT FOR LIKE WARS AND WHAT NOT AND UM WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WEIGHT UM OF THIS OBJECT WE'RE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEY'RE DOING RIGHT THERE,UM WE TUCK CA FLUPFER UM LIKE UM I LIKE AN OLD EN DAISY NOHOWT STUFFD FLINGS LIKE A CANNONPOL FER LIKE BOARS AND WHAT NOT AND DUM WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WAIT UM OF THIS OBJECT WERE FLINGING UP A MEASURING TAPE LIKE THEYARE DOING RIGHT THERE
410,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,THE YALL AH LIKE WE KIND INTO TWO VERYBLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WORSING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL
411,W YES WE WELL M UH MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY IT MIGHT UM HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS ES GO AS HIGH AND THE VARIABLE WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE STICK GOES IN OR OUT,WE YES WE WILL A MY TEACHER JUST WANTS US TO TEND CENTIMETERS BUT WHEN WE STARTED AT THIS EXPERIMENT WE DID TEN AND TWENTY SEVEN METERS AND WE THINK THAT IF WE DID TWENTY AND MIGHT U HAVE MORE MASS SO IT MIGHT NOT GO AS GO AS HIGH AND THE VARYABLE WERE WORKING ON IS HOW FAR THE TICK GOES IN OR OUT
412,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE EM AR PSICK IS THE POPSCLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SOADS LIKE ONE TO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
413,MAYBE YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS FIVE TEN SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE,MAYBE GOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER AS A RESULTS SO THEN YOU WOULD GET SEVENTEEN AND THEN TEN ELEVEN T THIRTEEN ONE TO THIRTY FOUR OR FIVE SO THEN YOU WOULD DIVIDE
414,UM LIKE HOW DID WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND IT GOES UP TO SIX CENTIMETERS A POPSICLE STICK AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ALUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KINDA CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM CAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT E LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BALL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY'S SPLITTING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IT IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW H I ALREADY SAID THAT HOW HIGH IT GOES SO E UM UH,UM LIKE HAT IT WE SET IT UP WE HAVE A STICK AND GOES UP TO SIX SENNIN WEANERS A POPSYCAL STICK AND WEARE PUTTING AN IN AS FAR AS WEWOULD LIKE AND WE HAVE UM ADUMINUM FOIL AND WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF CRUSHING IT INTO A BALL UM BCAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST LEAVE IT LIKE ON THE PIECE WITHOUT CRUMPLING IT INTO A BAL IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE AND THE GROUP I'M WITH LIKE EVERYBODY SPUNNING UP INTO DOING A DIFFERENT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW FAR THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING HOW HIGH THE BALL GOES AND SOME PEOPLE DOING HOW FAR THE STICK IS IN AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LIKE UM HOW I READY SAYD HOW HIGH IT GOES SO UM UH
415,UH HUH MMM HMM THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLIPPER AND UM TH UM SOMETIMES THE BALL WENT ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING UM KINDA TAPE MEASURING TAPE,A THE FLIPPER THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FLPPER AND DAM AM SOMETIMES THE BALL WHEN ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTIMETERS WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF A MEASURING A KIND O TAKE MEASURING TAPE
416,AND UM SO WE UM OW OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW FA THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR OUT IT IS NOT THAT WAY BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN I USE THAT OH THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT ER,AND THEM SOW WE AM OUR GROUP IS TESTING HOW THE MORE OUT IT IS LIKE THE MORE FAR ITOUT IT IS NOT NOWING BUT HOW FAR IT IS OUT CAN ET SET THE MORE FAR IS HOW
417,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER SO Y UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN,SEVENTEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THOSE ALTOGETHER SO UM YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE PLUS ONE THIRTY PLUS ONE FIFTEEN PLUS ONE SEVENTEEN IT WA
418,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DECIDED TO HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOUR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE SHE LETS US USE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GONNA BE OUR RESULT SO WE'RE KINDA MIXING MATH INTO THIS,WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RESULT SO THAT'S HOW MUCH HE DECIDED HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND UM WHATEVER YOU DIVIDED BY FOR I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART BUT I'M THINKING AFTER THE CHIEL TO SEESE CALCULATORS SO AFTER THE DECIMAL ON THE CALCULATOR THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR RESULT SO RECURNIT MIXING MATH INTO THIS
419,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE UM I GUESS N I BET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN EM IN BY THIS AFTERNOON,SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING HOW FAR THE ALUMINUMBALL GOES LIKE NOT UP BUT FAR IN DISTANCE I'M I GUESS NIVET WE'LL SHARE THEM CAUSE WE HAVE TO TURTA BID BY THIS I FEEW
420,UM WELL MY GROUP AND I TOOK TH A SMALL ALUMINUM FOIL BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT UM ALUMINUM FOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSICLE STICK CAUSE IF WE DID IT WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UM AFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USE OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSICLE STICK,UMBLE MY GROUP AND I TOOK A SMALL ALLUMINUMFOI BALL AND WE PLACED IT LIKE SEE THE CORK WE PLACED IT ALUM BOIL OF TEN INCHES AND CRUNCHED IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER POPSYCLE STICK AS IF WE DID WITH OUR FINGER WE THINK IT MIGHT UAFFECT IT LIKE IT MIGHT NOT GO AS HIGH OR IT MIGHT CHANGE THE VARIABLE IF WE USED OUR FINGER SO WE USED THE POPSTYCLE STICK
421,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOR EACH INCH SELECT FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID AT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS
422,SO LI SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLIPPED IT AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT LIKE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WOULD GO BY TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS W ONE,SO LET SO LIKE SAY OUR FIRST FLIP IF I FLUCKED IT IN THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT ENT OVER THEIR HEAD THEY WOULD PUT IT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEYOULD GO CLOSE TO THE TAPE SO SAY THAT WAS ONE THIRTY AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE FIFTEEN THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THE NEXT ONE WAS ONE
423,UH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE UM ALUMINUM FOIL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE'S A MEASURING TAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE UH THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT'S OUR LIKE GUESS SO,AH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE HOW HIGH THE THE U LUMINUFL GOES UP LIKE THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE THERE IS A MEASURE IN CAPE AND SEE HOW IT'S UP AND DOWN THAT'S HOW THE THAT'S WHY THAT'S HOW HIGH WE HAVE TO GO THAT AR LIKE GUESS SO WAS
424,THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT UH THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT,AND WERE FAR ITS OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT OUGHT THAT WE'RE IT WERE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT
425,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAY ET HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT
426,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND IN IN MORE AND MORE,IT'S LIKE A IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN IN IN MORNMORE
427,THE SWIRLY THINGS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THE L BIG LINE AND THE SMALL LINE ARE IS THE BATTERY RIGHT HERE,THI SWORTHY THINGS ARE LIGHT BLOBS AND THE BIG LINE IN THE SMALL LINE ARE IS THE BATTERY
428,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT HAS ONE TWO WIRES COMING OUT TWO WIRES COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM AND TWO COMING OUT OF THE TOP,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS BRIGTER BECAUSE IT HAS WHY TO WHAT YEURS COMING OUT TWO WIRES COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM AND TWO COMING OUT OF THE TOP
429,IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T LIGHT,IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHTBLE THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIPLE BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN THE LIPLE WOULDN'T WIT
430,ONE OF THEM HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT ONE HAS ONE LIGHT BULB AND IT'S REALLY BRIGHT,ONE OF THEM HAS TWO LIPLES AND THEIR NOT AS BRIGHT ONE HAS ONE LIGHTBLD AND ITS IALLY BREAK
431,THE SWITCH THE SWITCH'S ROLE IS TO MAKE ELECTRICITY THRO FLOW THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNET AND TO MAKE THE WASHERS STICK TO THE RIVET,THE SWITCH THE SWITCHES RULE IS TO MAKE ELECTRICITY THROAK FLOW THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNET AN TO MAKE THE WASHERS STICK TO THE RIFFET
432,BECAUSE WHEN WE CLICKED ON SHOW FLOW THE LITTLE ELECTRICITY MAG THINGS FLEW THROUGH THE RIVET AND MADE THE MAGNET STICK,BECAUSE WHEN WE CLICKED ON SHO FLOW THE LITTLE ELECTRICITY AND THINGS FLEW THROUGH THE RIVET AND MADE THE MAGNET STICK
433,SOME T SOME MAGNETS STICK IN SOME WAYS SO IF YOU TURN THEM ON ONE SIDE THEY STICK IF YOU TURN THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY DON'T STICK,SOME T SOME MAGNET STICK IN SOME WAYS SOM IF YOU TURN THEM ON ONE SIDE THEY STICK ANDIF YOU TURN UP ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY DON'T STICK
434,WHEN YOU WIND IT ONE HUNDRED TIMES IT H HOLDS FIFTEEN WASHERS WHEN YOU HOLD IT TEN TIMES IT'LL PROBABLY ONLY HOLD ABOUT ONE,WE NEED WIND IT ONE HUNDRED TIMES IT HOLDS FIFTEEN WASHERS WHEN YOU HOLD IT TEN TIMES IT'LL PROBABLY ONLY HOLD ABOUT ONE
435,THE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ONE WAY IS YOU LIST IT ONE THROUGH TEN ON THE X AXIS AND THE Y AXIS,THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ONE WAY IS YOU LISTED ONE THROUGH TEN ON THE EX AXIS AND THE WHITE AXIS
436,THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE THE MOTOR AND ITS MAKING THE MOTOR GOES THROUGH THE ITS MAKING MOTOR SPIN AND THEN OTHER ONE IS GOING THROUGH,THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING CONNECTING TO THE THE MOTOR END INS MAKING E MOTOR GO THROUGH THE SMAKING WOER SPIN ANDAND  OTHERWISE GO THE
437,THE D CELL HAD BEEN ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE IT MAY CONTAIN D CELL,THE DETAIL HAS ELECTRICITY IN THER SO IT CAS THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHTBLB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND BACK INTO THE DESAIL
438,ITS GIVING ENERGY THROUGH THE D CELL ACTUALLY LIKE ONE OF THEM GO AHEAD NEXT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE ACTIVITY CELL,ITS GIIN ENERGY THROUGH THE DESA UP TO THE LI RELM THEN GUIRE FLEX THE LIT MUB AND EMD ACTIVITY S
439,THAT WHEN ONE BATTERY WILL ALLOW THE OTHER ONE WE NEED ONE IS OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS COME BACK IN WILL GIVE LATER AND LATER,THAT WHEN ONE CATTERY RUNS OUT THE OTHER WILL WHEN IT RUNS OUT THE OTHER WILL COME BACK IN AND WE'LL GET LIGHTER N LITER
440,IT IS YOURSELF PROVIDES A BECAUSE SO THE WIRES IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE THE BATTERY IN THE INPUT ON TO THE LIGHT LATER,I DO YOURSELF PERVISE A PURKIT BECAUSE SO SO THE WIRES IF IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE THE BATTERY AND THEN PUT IT ONTO THE LIGHT IT LIGHT
441,IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE LEFT TO MAKE A LIGHT ON THE SIDE AND MAKE GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE,ISIT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE WALL F TL MAKE IT LIGHT AT ONS SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN THE WHITE BALL BACK INTO H
442,ITS BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND IS WHEN IT IS OF THE LIGHT BULB,IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WEN IT YOU TURN IT ON IT WELL TURN ON AND YOU DRA IT OFF THE LIGHT WAMP
443,THE SERIES CIRCUIT WILL REPLACE THAT BECAUSE ITS TRAVELLING ENERGY FROM THE PLUS AND THEN WHEN YOU GET INTO THE MINUS WILL GO THROUGH THE PLUS AND BACK TO THE SWITCH AND THEN TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO THE MINUS,A SERIOUS CECREIT WILL WORK LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S TRAVELLING ENERGY FROM THE PLUSE AND THEN WWHEN YOU GETS IN THE MIND AS HEWLL GO THROUGH THE PLUSE AND BACK TO THE SWETCH ANVENT TO THE LIVOB AND WENT BACK TO THE MINES
444,ITS ITS ONCE SIDE THE PLUS ARE GOING TO AROUND INTO THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE MINUS,IT'S IT'S ONE SIDE THE PLUS ARE GOING AROUND AND TO THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE LIP OB AND THEN INTO THE MINU
445,IT'S THE FIRST ENERGY TO THE SECOND ENERGY TO THE THIRD ENERGY AND WHEN IT BREAKS IT WILL WHEN ALSO THAN WHEN THEY PUT INTO LIGHT BULB IN IT WILL GO BACK,IT'S THE FIRST ENERGY TO THE SECOND ENERGY TO THE THIRD ENERGY AND WHEN IT BREAKS IT WILL WURN OUT SO THEN WHEN THEY PUT A NEW LABL AND IT WILL GO BACK
446,WHEN SOUTH AND NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL ATTRACT WHENEVER NORTH AND NORTH IT WILL REPEL SOUTH AND SOUTH WILL REPEL SOUTH AND NORTH WILL ATTRACT,WHEN SOUTH AND NORTH NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL ATTRACT WHEN NORTH AND NORTH AND NORTH IT WILL REPEL SOUTH AND SOUTH WILL REPELL SOUTH AND NORTH WILL ATTRACT
447,WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECTED TO THE BLOCK THEY WON'T ATTRACTS BECAUSE AS IRON INSIDE OF IT IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON INSIDE OF,WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNDUCT IT TO THE BLOCK IN WAT WI TRACKS POSSASS IRON INSIDE OF IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OUT OF
448,THIS NAIL WILL ATTRACT BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND AND THE RIVER ROCK WON'T ATTRACT WHERE THE BLOCK WON'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT,IS NO WE'LL ATTRACT CAS HAS IRON IN IT AND AND THE RIVER ROCK WON'T ATTRACT OR THE BLOCK WON'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN
449,IT'S IT'S MIDDLE AND INSIDE THE FRIDGE IS METAL TO AND METAL AND METAL OR IRON AND IRON WILL GO TOGETHER AND ATTRACT,IT'S ITS METAL AND INSIDE THE FRIDGE IS METAL TOO A METALN METAL OR IRON AND IRON WILL GO TOGETHER AND IT WILL A TRAC
450,I KNOW THAT UM CIRCUITS IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF THE LIGHT IN ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF,I KNOW THAT UM SOKIT IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIGHT BULPS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OF LIGHT NOT ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF
451,WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF,PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIHT BOLPS AND STUFF
452,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON UNTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE,I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON TILL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE
453,THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BY TO OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT,THCIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHE ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS AR UMCLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEI SHAPES DIFFERENT
454,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH,WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIKT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S HE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
455,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL ST,IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE THE PARALLELS THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT ELL ALL THE OTHER ONES TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONES THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONES STILL ST
456,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT,UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHTBULK LOOK DIFFERENT
457,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE,I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULL PAIR OF LIGHT BOLBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE
458,UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK,UM I THINK IF THE WHYET WASN'T THERE IF THERE IS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT DELIGHT BUL WOULDN'T EVEN WORK
459,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY,UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULK ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE IS TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND WANT TO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY
460,THIS ONE IS UM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO FLOW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE,THIS ONE IS AM IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE'S FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO THROW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE
461,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON,THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YES SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WEARE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT TO LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON
462,THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON,THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT IN THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OFF A LIGHT BULB WHEN THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON
463,UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH,N WHEN ONE BOL PROVES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TITH FLOW THROUGH
464,WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH,WELL UNDER THE WIRES KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY ON GO THROUGH
465,UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THING'S THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB,OM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THINGS THE LIGHT THE UMBATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHTFUL
466,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE,I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS EM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY COVED WIRE
467,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS THE SAME UM AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY,I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS UM THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN INE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY
468,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB,MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULL BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB
469,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KINDA THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KIND OF THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN ON LIGHTS UP
470,WELL WHAT YOU DO WOULD YOU WRAP IT A KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THEN ANOTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOULD TURN ON,WELL WOULD YOU DO WOULD YOU'D WRAP IT KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UNBATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUFF SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THE THE TH THER METAL PART IN IT YOULD TURN ON
471,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE OF THE NOTCHES OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY,THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERAT TO THE LIGHT BULL AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLUNG THROUGH ONE OF THE KNOCHIS OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY
472,I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WAS IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T PUT IT ON THE UM BUTTON BUT UM IT IT WE IT'S GOING THROUGH A CERTAIN PARTS UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING IT GLOW COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING AROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN,I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WAS IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'TFIT IT ON THE UBBUT UM IT'S GOING THROUGH CERTAIN PARTS UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING AT GLOW COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING ROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN
473,WELL HERE NO BECAUSE THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULB IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME,HERE OR NO BECAUSE THE WYR ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULPIS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME
474,THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR WOULD SORT OF BE LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN,WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU ARE DRIVING HE COAGE SORT OF LIKE A HIGH WAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN
475,UM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT,AN WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON AND WOULD SEN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT
476,AT THE UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM,AT THE EM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SORELYTHING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM
477,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND,WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
478,YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KINDA THING AND YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO,T YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THIS WURLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEM RIGHT UNDER THAT IT'S THE LITTLE LIP KIND OF THING AND YOU'D HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO
479,THEY ARE I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THOUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE V FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH,THEY OR IINS  THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THROUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH
480,WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT,I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED SING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE DEW SELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT
481,WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB,WE WERE USING WHIRE AUNT A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UMWHITE BULP
482,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT,IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE WHITE BULL TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE ELECTRICLY TRISTA FLOWS THAN IT GOES TO THE MINOS SIDE BUILTS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRIITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE IN EITHER THE LHIGHT BULP AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT
483,IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS SIDE IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT,TRAVELS FROM THE PLACIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINASIDE AND GET TORED INTO THE MINOCID MINOCIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT
484,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT IN YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAND ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURE
485,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AN TEXTURE AND
486,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS IN VERY IMPORTANT ROLL BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOTH AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
487,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,EM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT A THE SALT LAKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
488,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS OF ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
489,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THIS SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILE WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
490,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS ITIMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY ARE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUED PILE INSTEAD OF N ONE ALTOGETHER IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
491,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT ON ITS PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN IN ITS DAZ AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT IN YET
492,UH THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SWIRL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK,A THE SALAD HAS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN IT AND THE MARBLES HAVE LIKE A DIFFERENT COLOR SQUIRREL INSIDE AND UM I'M TALK
493,THE PROPERTIES OF SALT IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES UM IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT IT WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER,THE PROPERTIES OF SAUL IS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT LEAVES A IT LEAVES NO TRACE THAT I WAS EVER THERE IN THE WATER
494,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS WHEN ONE OR MORE IS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPLE THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS THAT MIXTURES IS ONE ONE OR MORE THESE WUNMULTPUL THINGS ARE MIX TOGETHER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO BE SEPARATED AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE MULTIPUL THINGS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
495,THE SALAD HAS MANY THING MIXED INTO IT UM ONE OF THE CUPS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEANS AND NORMAL BEANS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES,THE SALAD HAS MANY THINGS MIXED INTO IT ON ONE OF THE CUTS HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND SAND PAPER AND THEN THERE'S A PILE OF LIKE JELLY BEAMS AND NORMAL BEAMS THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES
496,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU UM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER AND STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN UM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL STAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN,THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER YOU AM YOU CAN PUT IT THROUGH LIKE A COFFEE FILTER IN STUFF AND THEN THE WATER WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN AM LIKE THE MUD OR SOMETHING WILL SAY IN THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT WON'T GO DOWN
497,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ON THE TRAIL MAKE SEPARATE AND TATSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
498,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT,I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF ILLUSION THAT EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT SINCITEED
499,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT,THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLAR HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
500,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY FULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE FANTASTIC,WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND IT MUST TASTE VERY VERY SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR AND VERY VERY VERY PULL IF IT IS WITH THE GRAPE TASTIC
501,WELL TODAY WE USED UH WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE I CAN'T,WELL TO DAY WE USED A WEIGHT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO USED TASTE AND WE ALSO USED SOMETHING ELSE AGAN
502,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS UM PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE,THE ONE WITH MORE GRAPE IN IT HAS LITTLE TINY BLUE DOT THINGS IN IT AND SO DOES THE ONE WITH LESS AM ORIN PURPLE STUFF IN IT BUT THE ONE WITH MORE PURPLE STUFF IN IT HAS MORE BIG CUBES OF PURPLE AN THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS BIG CUBES OF PURPLE
503,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE,ONE MIXTURE WITH MORE POWDER IN IT WOULD TASTE MORE SWEET AND SLIGHTLY SOUR COMPARED TO ONE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OR LESS THINGS OF GRAPE
504,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LESS IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MIX,EACH MIXTURE HAS FIFTY MILL METERS OF WATER AND THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS A DARKER HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF GRAPE POWDER AND THE ONE WITH LAST IS ONLY ONE SPOONFUL AND THEY BOTH ARE A PART OF THE DRINK MAC
505,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNI FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU CAN ALSO TELL IT BY WEIGHT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WON'T,WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS MARNIE FIRST YOU CAN TELL IT BY TASTE SECOND YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW IT LOOKS AND THIRD YOU COULD ALSO TELL IT BY WAIT BUT THAT ONE'S NOT THAT SMART SO I WOULD D
506,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE,THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILL LEADERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUBE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE
507,ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM,ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION AN
508,YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS YOU CAN POUR THEM INTO A THINGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD UM YOU COULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCRATCH THAT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE,YOU CAL DO MANY THINGS YOU CULDN POUR THEM INTO A LITTLE THANGY AND LET THEM EVAPORATE YOU COULD A UCOULD PUT THEM THROUGH A FILTER AND SEE EM HOW MUCH STUFF IS LEFT ACTUALLY SCOTCHED LOT JUST LET THEM EVAPORATE
509,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GRAPE MIX ONE HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LESS PURPLE,I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SALT LA WATER SOLUTION YOU DO NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE GLASSES BUT WITH THE GREAT MIX ONE THAT HAS ONE IS DARKER ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE IS LAST PURPLE
510,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN SORRY WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR,WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN WHEN YOU PUT THE FEATHER IN IT'S LIGHTER AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN NORMAL AIR BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE ROCK IN IT'S A HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROCK OUT THE FEATHER IS HEAVIER AGAIN TO AIR
511,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER,THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SKALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
512,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE,BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIED MILE LATERS OF THE WATER BUT WITH THE ONE THAT HAS MORE IT WILL NATURALLY WEIGH MORE
513,YOU COULD TELL HOW CONCENTRATED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE ONE THAT HAS LESS POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER,YOU CAN TELL HOW COMPTE TRAINDED THEY ARE BY THE COLOR OF THEM THE TASTE OF THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH IN THE GRAPE DRINKS MIX THE ONE THAT HAS THE LAST POWDER IS THE ONE LIGHTER AND THE ONE THAT HAS MORE POWDER IS DARKER
514,I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT NOT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SALUBE WITH A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
515,I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS,I THINK THE ONE WITH CHANNY GRAMPS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HUAS MORE SOLUE THE OTHER ONE HAS LAUED
516,THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT,THINKS FORNIE I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BET
517,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SALT IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT EVAPORATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE SOL IS SEPARATED AND LEFT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER EVAPORATES
518,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS,THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT YOU COULD LET THE THING EVAPORATE YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT APART WITH A SCREEN YOU COULD USE A O YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HANDS
519,IS THE LITTLE TINY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER,IS THE LITTLE TIDY GRAINS OF SALT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT LARNEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT FROM WATER
520,HERE ONE TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WITH NOTHING BUT SALT CRYSTALS,HERE WHON TYPE OF LIQUID I AM GUESSING THAT IT IS SALT IS MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN WHEN YOU MIX IT TOGETHER IT AM IT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS  WITH NOTHING BUT FOCRYSTAL
521,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU POUR YOU THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU LEAVE THEM THERE THE SALT STAYS AND THE WATER DISAPPEARS
522,HERE THE FLOUR IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ONTO THE BOTTOM AND AND THE REST OF THE FLOUR STAYS ON THE TOP IN THE COFFEE FILTER,HERE THE FLOWER IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS THE WATER ON THE WATER GETS POURED DOWN A FILTER THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT AND ON TO THE BOTTOM AND AN THE REST OF THE FLOWER STAYS FROM THE TOP IN THE COFEE BILTER
523,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PICTURE MARNEY IS WHEN YOU ADD WATER TWO SALT OR SALT TO WATER IT CREATES A SALT WATER MIXTURE AND THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTEY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THAT TOGETHER EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAM
524,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS,THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS IN THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
525,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED MORE GRAM CUBES TO EQUAL THAT,I SEE THAT WHEN YOU POUR ONE THING INTO A CUP AND THEN USE A SCALE FOR IT AND THEN YOU GET SOME GRAM CUBES AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP YOU CAN CREATE ON A WAY THAT IS EQUAL OR ABOUT EQUAL AND WHEN YOU PUT ANOTHER THING ADDED TO THE MIXTURE YOU NEED A MORE GRAM CUBES TE EQUAL THAT
526,I THINK WITH SALT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP BY HAND A FILTER DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE,I THINK WITH SAL THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK IT UP A HAND A FILTURE DOESN'T WORK ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET IT EVAPORATE
527,SURE MARNEY SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE TOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION THE BEST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIX IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER EVAPORATE AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS,SEREMURNIE SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH TODAY IS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS WE SHOOK SOME NORMAL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WAY AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOOGETHER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPINION BAST OF ALL WAS WHEN YOU TAKE SALT AND WATER MIXE IT TOGETHER THEN YOU LET THE WATER A THAT RAY AND YOU'RE ONLY LEFT WITH SALT CRYSTALS
528,THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THING AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE AND THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL,IS CALLED EVAPORATION MARNIE WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER THEN YOU POUR IT INTO A THANG AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR AND THE WA IN THE SALT CRYSTALS WILL A WILL STAY IN THERE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM ONCE IN FERON
529,I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS BEING POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION,I NOTICE THAT THE CECCITRIC ACID IS BEIN POURED INTO THE WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE FILTER AND THEN ONCE YOURE DONE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT ALL IT GOES DOWN AND STAYS IN THE IN THE BUCKET BELOW THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THE COFFEE FILTER THIS IS CALLED A SOLUTION
530,THE SAND AND IN THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE THE SAND STAYS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YOU IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT,THE SANDIN IN THE SANDAND WATER MAKE SURE THIS THE SAND SHAKES OF THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND IN THE SALT AND WATER EXPERIMENT YE THE IT DISSOLVES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT
531,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE,ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS EITHER WEIGH TEN GRAMS OR TWENTY GRAMS WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE FIFTY GRAMS AND WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS THINGS ARE MIXED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE
532,I KNOW THAT NOTICE THAT SALT IS BEING MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP WITH THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER,I KNOW THE NOTICE THAT SALT IS BE MIXED WITH WATER AND THEN IT'S POURED DOWN A COFFEE FILTER AND THE WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT INSTEAD OF STAYING AT THE TOP OF THE COFFEE FILTER IT GOES DOWN WITH THE WATER
533,WELL IT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILLIMETERS CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOOR TO SOMETHING OR HOLD IT AND THEN MEASURE UP TO YOU COULD DO THAT AND STUFF,WELL IT'S YOU COULD UM USE MILIMET OR SENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND UM JUST MEASURE FROM THE FLOOR TO SOMETHING OR A WHOLE DED AND MEASURE UP TO COULD DO THAT ANDSTO
534,HOLD THE TAPE MEASURE LIKE I SAID AND THEN MAKE THEM LEAVE OFF LIKE I SAID UM AND THEN MEASURE UP FROM THERE,WHAT'S IMPORTANT MARNE IS THAT UM YOU SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU SHOULD
535,IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO HEIGHT UM N SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE BY TO YOUR HEIGHT REALLY BY TO YOUR HEIGHT YEAH,IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO HEIGHT UM SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT NOT USUALLY IT WOULD NORMALLY BE CLOSE TO YOUR HEIGHT REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR HEIGHT YE
536,IF YOU WANTED TO MEASURE HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SOMETHING IS YOU COULD USE YOUR PINKIE TO COUNT IT OUT WHAT'S UP WITH THAT,IF YOU WANTED TO MEASURE HOW MANY CENT TO METERS SOMETHING ITIS YOU COULD USE YOUR PINKIE TO COUNT IT OUT WHAT SUP WIT THAT
537,ONE END OF THE TABLE AND THEN END AT THE OTHER BUT I SHOULD HOLD MY PLACE SO I DON'T FORGET WHERE I WAS,IT SHOWS ME I SHOULD BEGIN AT
538,YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE LIKE UM YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE A ME METERS BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIER TO USE THAN SMALLER THINGS I THINK,YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE LIKE UM YOU WOULD PROBLY USE A MET METERS BECAUSE THEY ARE EASIER TO USE THAN SMALLER THINGS THAT
539,UM WHAT'S THE UM YOU SHOULD GO F YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TAPE MEASURE GO TO THEIR FEET AND THEN GO UP AND MAKE THEM HOLD THEIR FINGER WHERE YOU LEFT OFF AND THEN TAKE IT OFF AND THEN UM PUT IT ON AGAIN LIKE PUT IT SO IT GOES UP AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT IS,UM WHAT UM YOU SHOULD GO YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TEA MEASURE  GO TO THEIR FEET AND THEN GO UP AND MAKE THEM HOLD THEIR FINGER WHERE YOU'RE LEFT OFF AND THEN TAKE IT OFF AND THEN UM PUT IT ON AGAIN LIKE PUT IT TILL IT GOES UP AND THEN YOU COUL SEE WHERE IT IS

542,CHANGED BY WE WOULD PLACE UM A LITTLE MARKER IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS TO SEE UM HOW STRONG THE FLOW STILL IS WITH IT BLOCKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD,CHANGE BY WE WOULD PLACE ON A LITTLE MARKET IN BETWEEN THETWO MAGNETS TO SEE OM HOW STRONG THE FLO STILL IS WITH IT BLOCKING HE MAGNETIC FIELD
543,WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED STICKERS AND WE PUT EM ON A GRAPH TO SHOW UM HOW MANY SPACERS THAT WE COULD USE BEFORE THE MAGNETIC FIELD BROKE,WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED TICKERS AND WE PUT EM MONOGRAPH TO SHOW OM HOW MANY SPACERS THAT WE COULD USE BEFORE THE MAGNETIC FIELD BROKE
544,WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAPHING THE INFORMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AS THE MORE SPACERS THAT YOU PUT AND HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL GET,WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAFPING THE INFORMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AS THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU PUT IN HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL GET
545,WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD UM TWO MAGNETS ONE WAS IN A PLASTIC CUP THE OTHER WAS ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE AND WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY WASHERS WE COULD FIT INTO ANOTHER CUP,WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD ON TWO MAGNETS ONE WAS IN A PLACID CUP THE OTHER WAS ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE AND WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY WASHERS WE COULD FIT INTO ANOTHER CUP
546,MMM THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT CAUSE THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU ADDED THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAD SO THE LESS WASHERS YOU CAN FIT INTO THE CUP,THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT CAUSE THE MORE SPACE WAS THAT YOU ADDED THE LESS A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT HAD SO THE LESS WASHES YOU COULD FIT INTO THE CUP
547,DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FIELD WOULD FLOW THROUGH TO KEEP IT HELD SO THAT THE BALANCE WOULDN'T BREAK,DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE SPACERS THAT YOU OULD PUT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THE LESS OMMAGNETIC FIELD WOULD FLOW THROUGH TO KEEP IT HEL THAT THE BALANCE WOULDN'T BREAK
548,TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU PUT UM S THINGS OR IN THIS CASE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE LESS MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAS,ELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU PUT ON THINGS OR IN THE SCASE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE LESS MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAS
549,WELL I FOUND OUT THAT UM WITH THE REGULAR MAGNET YOU CAN FIT TWENTY ONE WASHERS INTO THE OTHER CUP BEFORE BREAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD,I FOUND OUT THAT OM WITH THE REGULAR MAGNET YOU COULD FIT TWENTY ONE WASHERS INTO THE OTHER CUP BEFORE BREAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD
550,UM YES WE DID WE HAD A SCALE WITH A BAG OF WASHERS AND ALSO FIVE SPACERS TO USE AND OF COURSE THE MAGNETS,YUST WE DID WE HAD A SCALE WITH A BAG OF WASHERS AND ALSO FIVE SPACERS TO USE AND OF COURSE THE MAGNETS
551,A CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE WIRES THAT GO AROUND THAT COMPLETES THE ELECTRIC FLOW SO THAT IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE,A CIRCUIL IS WHEN YOU HAVE WIRES THAT GO AROUND THE COMPLETE THE ELECTRIC FLOWS THAT S GOING IN A CIRCLE

554,IT TURNS AROUND THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS FLOWING THROUGH ONLY THOUGH IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S STILL COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT TURNS AROUND THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS FLOWING THROUGH ONLY THO IT'S GOING OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S STILL COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
555,TO ME THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND IT HEATS UP CAUSE IT CAN'T GO THROUGH AS WELL SO IT LIGHTENS UP,TO ME THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT TO MAKE THE LIGHTBULP LIGHT UP THE ELECTRICITY FLOATS THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND IT HEATS UP CAUSE IT CAN'T GO THROUGH AS WELL SO IT LIGHTENS UP
556,THINK IT IS BECAUSE AND MOST ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IF IT DOESN'T FLOW FROM THE UM NEGATIVE SIDE IT MIGHT NOT WORK BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE ABOUT THAT,THINK IT IS BECAUSE AN MOST ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IF IT DOESN'T FLOW FROM THE O NEGATIVE SIDE IT MIGHT NOT WORK BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE ABOUT THAT
557,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL AND IT COMPLETES THE CIRCUITS SO THAT THE MOTOR WILL WORK,IT'S GOING ON IS THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL AND IT COMPLETES THE CIRCUITS THAT THE MOTOR WILL WORK
558,WHAT IS UP WITH THEM IS THAT THEY AREN'T MADE OF ANY KIND OF IRON METAL OR STEEL SO THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WON'T FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,AND WHAT IS UP WITH THEM IS THAT THEY AREN'T MADE OF ANY KIND OF IRON METAL OR STEEL SO THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WON'T FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
559,THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH JUST A BASIC ONE THAT GOES AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH JUST A BASIC ONE THAT GOES AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
560,WELL THIS PICTURE IS HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD SHOW HOW A BATTERY AND THE WIRES GO TO A LIGHT BULB AND AND IT HAS A PICTURE OF A SWITCH AT THE BOTTOM BUT THAT'S NOT THE PICTURE THAT AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD USE,WELL THIS PICTURE IS HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD SHOW HOW A BATTERY AND THE WIRES GO TO A LIGHTBULB AND AND HAS A PICTURE OF A SWITCH AT THE BOTTOM BUT THAT'S NOT THE PICTURE THAT A AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD USE
561,THE WAY TO GET IT TO WORK WOULD BE TO JUST TAKE THE LEVER AND MOVE IT OVER TO WHERE THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THAT PIECE OF METAL,THE WAY TO GET IT TO WORK WOULD BE TO JUST TAKE THE LEVER AND MOVE IT OVER TO WHERE THE WIREIS CONNECTED TO THAT PIECE OF METAL
562,UM ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF IRON WILL WORK OR ANY JUST PRETTY MUCH ANY KINDA STEEL OR METAL WILL WORK,ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF IRON WILL WORK OR ANY JUS PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF STEAL OR METAL WILL WORK
563,I THINK THAT MOSTLY ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL LIKE STEEL IRON GOLD GOLD IS THE ONE OF THE REALLY GOOD CONDUCTORS WILL WORK,I THINK THAT MOSTLY ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL LIKE STEEL IRON GOLD GOLD IS THE ONE OF THE REALLY GOOD CONDUCTORS WIR WORK
564,WELL A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE A CIRCUIT SO THAT A LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR OR WHATEVER YOU'RE USING WILL WORK,WELL A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH IT TO MAKE A CIRCUIT SO THAT A LIGHT BALL BOR MOTOR OR WHATEVER UUSING WILL WORK
565,WELL TO ME THEY S IT SURPRISED ME THAT THEY WOULD USE HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD DRAW UM HOW TO MAKE A MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB RUN,WELL TO ME THEY IT SURPRISED ME THAT THEY WOULD USE HOW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD DRAW UH HOW TO MAKE A MOTOR LIGHT BALL RUN
566,WELL IT WOULD GO FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GO THROUGH TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND KEEP FLOWING UNTIL IT COMES BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE ON THE D CELL BATTERY,WELL IT WOULD GO FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GO THROUGH TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND KEEP FLOWING UNTIL IT COMES BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE ON THE DECAIL BATTERY
567,THE PICTURE THAT I'M SEEING IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE METAL IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER UM I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT WIRE OUTLET TO MAKE IT WORK,THE PICTURE THAT I'M SEEING IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE METAL IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER U MY GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT WIRE OUTLET TO MAKE IT WORK
568,WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT WAS TO SEE WHAT WE COULD FIND UM THAT A MAGNET WOULD STICK TO LIKE IRON OR METAL,WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT WAS TO SEE WHAT WE COULD FIND ON THAT A MAGNETE WOULD STICK TO LIKE IRON OR METAL
569,WELL WHAT WE DID TODAY WAS UM WE WENT AROUND OUR CLASSROOM TO SEE WHAT UM A MAGNET COULD STICK TO,WELL WHAT WE DID TO DAY WAS ON WE WENT AROUND OUR CLASSMIN TO SEE WHAT AN A MAGNET COULD STICK TO
570,THERE WAS A NAIL A ROCK UM A RUBBER BAND SPONGE WIRE MESH UM A COUPLE OF NAILS AND A STRAW,THERE WAS A NAIL A ROCK ON A RUBBER BAND SPONGE WIRE MASH ON A COUPLE OF NAILS AND STRA
571,WELL WHAT WE DID WAS UM FIRST WE STARTED OUT WITH A BAG OF OBJECTS AND WE TOOK EM A RING MAGNET TO SEE WHAT THE MAGNET WOULD STICK TO IN THE BAG AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WELL WHAT WE GOOD WAS OM FIRST WE STARTED OUT WITH E BAG OF OBJECTS AND WE TOOK UM A RING MAGNET TO SEE WHAT THE MAGNET WOULD STICK TO IN THE BAG AND WHAT WOULD
572,IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IF IT'S JUST BY SELF IT CAN'T THE COMPLETE CIRCUIT SO AND NEEDS A SWITCH TO AH UMM FOR ITS LIGHT LIKE THIS BUT IF IT DOESN'T THE SWITCH IT BLOW LIKE THAT,IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IF IT'S JUST BY ITSELVS IT CAN'T ON BE COMPLETE CIRCUIT SO AND EADS A SWITCH TO ON FOR ITS A LIGHT LIKE THIS BUT IF IT DOESN'T TE SWICH IT WON'T LIGHT LIKE TH
573,I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT LIGHT NOW BUT THEY NEED PUT TO LATER SWITCH ON A GLOW LIKE A PRETTY LIKE THAT,I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE UM  IT IS IT ISN'T LIGHTEN NOW BUT EN YO PORTULITTE SWIT OHN IT GLOWS IKE A FRETYN PRETTY
574,INDISCERNIBLE ANALYSE BECAUSE LAST FIXTURE OF THE FILAMENT BROKE IN LAST FIXTURE THE FILAMENT BROKE IN THE LAST FIXTURE FILAMENT BROKE AND YOU SHOWED ME SO MANY BROKEN FILAMENT,ARELATESCA'S LAST PICCHUR THE FALMENT BROKE AND THE AND LAST PITCHER THE FALMET BROKE IN THE LAST WHICHTHE ST BROKE A NEW SHOWED ME SO MANY FONG BROKEN FIELD

584,IT'S IS POWER INSIDE THE LIGHT BULB THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE WIRE WIRES INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN SO ON,IT IS POWWER INSIDE THE LIGHT BULP THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BALB BACK THROUGH THE WILDER WIRES INTO THE BATTERY AND SO ON
585,THEY HELP POWER THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THEY GO OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER IT,THEY HELP UM POWER THE LIGHT BALB CAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THEY GO UP TO LIGHTBALL TO POWER
586,WHEN THEY BOTH ON THE BOTTOM YEAH IT DOESN'T TURN ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING THAT WAY BUT WHEN ONCE ON THE SIDE AND ONCE UNDERNEATH THAN IT COULD WORK,WHEN THEY'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM EM IT DOESN'T TURN ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING THAT WAY BUT WHEN ONE'S ON THE SIDE AN ONE'S UNDERNEATH THEN IT COULD WORK
587,THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE D CELL BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT THE LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE D CELL,THE ELECTRICITIES GOING TO DESEIL BATTERING THE OUT THE DECAIL BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BALB AN OUT THE LIGHT BALB BACK TO THE DECEIL
588,IT FLOWS BECAUSE IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY TO THE WIRES BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE WIRES KIND OF GET THE ELECTRICITY AND GOES THROUGH INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN,IT FLOWS BECAUSE IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY TO THE WIRES BECAUSE IT'S THE WIRES KIND OF GET THE ELECTRICIAN IT GOES THROUGH INTO THE LIGHT BALL AN THE
589,I SEE GOING ON THE ELECTRICITY IS UM COMING OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES A LIGHT BULB AND THEN ITS GOING BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN GOING OUT AGAIN LIKE A CYCLE,I SEE GOING ON THE ELECTRICITIES OM COMING OUT THE OM BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRE TO THE LIGHT MALB AND THE ITS GOING BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THE GOING OUT AGAIN LIOCYCLE
590,FIRE THAT KILLS YOU IN YOUR SLEEP I SEE FIRE THAT KILLS YOU IN NO MATTER WHAT IT DOES KILL YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEP ANYWAY COULD BECOME I HOPE,FIRE THAT KILLS YOU IN YOU SLEEP AS SEE FIRE THAT KILLS YOU IN NO MATTER WHAT AT TIMES KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP ANYWAKE WOU EY HA
591,I DON'T KNOW UMM DO YOU KNOW JUST ASKING AH AND YOU'RE REAL PERSON NOT JUST THE CREEPY PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE A JOB,I DON'T KNOW DO YOU KNOW JUST ASKING  ANDARE YOU REAL PERSON OR JUST ACREEPPO PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE A J
592,I THINK IT SHARES A PATH WAY BECAUSE AND I THINK IT SHARES A PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE BOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME BATTERY,I THINK IT SHARES A PATHWAY BECAUSE IM IM I THINK IT SHARES A PATHWAT BECAUSE THEREBOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME MATTER
593,I NOTICE THAT WITH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER THERE IS NO WIRES IT WON'T WORKS FOR COUPLE OF MINUTES BUT NOT FLUNK BUT ON THE OTHER ONE IT WILL WORK BECAUSE ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW YES I DO BUT IT WAS TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE WORKING ETC AND YEAH,I NOTICE THAT WITH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE SI TOUCHING EACH OTHER WITH NO WIRES IT WON'T WORK BILL WORK FOR COUPLEMENTS BUT NOT FLONG BUT ON THE OTHER ONE IT WILL WORK BECAUSE ACT IOUL HAVE NO YES I DO AH BUT WITH TOO LIGH BA TO WORK AND ET CETERA CETERA AND YA
594,AH UMM WELL I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE CRAZY WAIT OKAY SO IF YOU HAVE ONE LIGHT BULB AND ONE BATTERY IT WILL CLUB AND IF YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY AND TWO LIGHT BULBS IT WILL CLUB BUT IF YOU HAVE IT WILL GLOW BRIGHTER THERE WAS TWO FROM THE BOTTOM IT HAD TWO WIRES TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY A DIFFERENT FORM THEN IT WOULDN'T GLOW BUT NOT SO BRIGHT,M WELL I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE CRAZY WAIT WI WIT OQE SO IF YOU HAVE ONE LIHT BALL THEN ONE BATTERY IT WILL GLOW AND IF YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY AND TWO LIPEBALBS ILL GLUB BUT IF YOU HAV ILL GLOW BRIHTER O THOSE TWO BUT FROM THE BOTTOM IF YOU HAD TWO WIRES TWO LIEBALBS IN ONE BATTERY IN A DIFFERENT FORM THEN IT WILL GLOW BUT NOT SO BR
595,WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE MAINLY ELECTRICITY THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO LIGHT BULB ONE TO LIGHT BULB TWO THEY GOING BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES IT GOES AGAIN OUT TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE,WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE MAINLY LECTRICITY THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE NEG IBESIDE INTO LIGHT BUT ONE TO LIGT OP TO THEN GOING BACK TO THE PALATIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES AND THEN IT GOES AGAIN OUT TO THE NEGATIVE SAD
596,I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING IF VARIOUS THEN FROM ONE PLATE ONE NEITHER ONE PALATE TOWARDS AND LIKE THAT I HAVE NO I DON'T REMEMBER IT SHOWS ON FROM TWENTY ONE,I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING IF ITS ONE FROM ONE POINT ONE NOR WHEN PUTN TWO OR SOMHING LIKE THAT I KNOW I I DON'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE FROM TWO POINT ONE
597,WELL THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIKE BULB ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING EACH OF LIKE BULB TWO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK TO LIKE BULB ONE THEN GOES BACK ITS TO THE A POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GOES BACK OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOESN'T AGAIN,E WELL THE ENERGIES COMING UP THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING THROUGH LIKE BALB WINE GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN GOING INTO LIGHTBOLB TOO THEN GOING THROUGH THE WIRE BACK THROUGH LIKE BAB ON THEN GOES BACK INTO THE A POSITIVE SIDE THN GOES BACK UP THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND DOES THAT AGAIN
598,WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDES TOUCHING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE WIRES GETTING A NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKE INTO,AND WHEN THE POSIT SIDE SOUCHING A NEGATE SIDE SIDE IN A WIRE SKITTING A NEGATIVE SIDE IN THE UN ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT PULBS AND MAKING THE
599,ELECTRICITY BECAUSE ELECTRICITY IS A BLUE DOTS FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE WHILE THROUGH THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHEN THE WIRE ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S THE UNTIL LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHERS,ELECTRICITY CA ELECTRICITE'S A BLUE DOTH GOING THROUGH THE DECAIL AND THE ONE OF THE WIRES IS ON THE POSITIVSEADE WHEN THE WIRES ARON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND AND TURNED TO LIPEL BACK TO THE OTHER
600,JUST IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS ACTUALLY STAYING LIKE ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS A NOT REALLY AND KEEPS GOING OFF AND YOU HAVE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE BULB AND STUFF LIKE,IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE AH THAT ONE'S ACTUALLY STAYING LIT ON DETAIL ONE AND THAT ONE IS LIKE NOT REALLY IT IT KEEPS GOING OFF THEN YOU HAV LIKE REDYLIHTFUL IN STUFF LIKE
601,AH WELL RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAD THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE,I WHEN RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAS THE WIRES BOTH TUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES AR TOUCHING BOTH OF THE BOTH OF THE NGATIVE SIZE ER TUCHING EACH OTHER W WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE OF TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKED BECAUSE THERE'S A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIV
602,ONE D CELL AND IT'S NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL,I ON WAN DY SELL IT SNOP THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON THE CELL TOO A BUT THE TWO BATTERIES TILL LIHT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN DICELL
603,WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAVE THAT WHAT,WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAVE THE WA
604,IF WIRES BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE WHICH SHOULD MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,IT FLOWS BECAUSE BUT ONE OF THE WIRES ARE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE IN ONE F THE WIRE DROWN NEGTIFIED AL MAKING IT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
605,IT'S NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY IN THERE IS NOTHING THERE IS NO WIRE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE IS ONLY WIRE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE,ITS NOT FLOWING BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ELECTROCEIN THA THERES NOTHING THERE'S NO WIRES HOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S ONLY WIRE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVES
606,IT REFLECTED BY IT WILL GET MAY BE IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND MORE D CELL TO YOU GET FIT IN THIS,IL AFFECTED BY IT WILL GET MAYBE IT'LL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER THE MORE DETAILS YOUILL GET FIT IN THE
607,WHEN WIRE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONE SIDE AND ONE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE WHICH IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB GLOW,ENE WIRE IS SUTCHIN THE NEGATIVE SIDE IN ONE WHEN WIRE SUCHING THE THE ONE WIRE IS SUCH A TE NEGED AVSIDE IN ONE SIDE AND ONE WRE IS SUCH A TO LOSITIVE SIDE WHICH HE IS MAKING THE LIBA G
608,IT CHANGES THE SERIES CIRCUIT BY IF LIKE RIGHT NOT HAS ONE D CELL AND IT'S MAKING A NOT CLOSER BRIGHT BUT WHEN YOU MAKE ANOTHER D CELL PUT ANOTHER D CELL AND IT MAKES IT MORE BRIGHTER AND THERE ARE LIGHT BULBS GLOW BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE ON D CELL ONE THERE IS ONE BATTERY WHICH IS MAKING A GLOW TO LOW,IT CHANGES THE SERIOUS CIRCUIT BY IF LIGHT WRIGHT NOUT HAS ONE DESAIL ENDS MAKING IT NOT CLOSE  BRIGHT BUT WHEN YOU MAKE ANOTHER D SOI IT PUT ANOTHER DESOI AND IT MAKES IT MORE BRIGHTER AND TEN LIGHT BALBS GLOW BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE IT BUT ON DESO ONE THEREIS THERE'S ONLY ONE BATTERY WHICH IS MAKING IT GLOW TO LOW
609,THE WATER IS CREATING A MIRROR IMAGE FOR THE UM FOR THE PENCIL AND IT'S MAKING IT LOOK LIKE THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PENCIL IS OVER TO IS IS OVER TO THE RIGHT,THE WATER IS CREATING A MERE IMAGE FOR THE UM FOR THE PENCIL IN AND IT'S MAKING IT LOOK LIKE THE BOTTOM HALF THE PENCIL IS OVER TO IS IS OVER TO THE RIGHT
610,THE WATER IS MAKING IT A MIRROR IMAGE MAKING THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PENCIL LOOK LIKE IT'S KIND OF OVER TO THE RIGHT SO THAT IT'S LIKE SPLIT IN,THE WATER IS MAKING IT A MERROR IMAGE MAKING THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PENCIL LOOKED LIKE ITS KIND OF OVER TO THE RIGHT SO THAT IT'S LIKE SPLIIN
611,AT FIRST THE LIGHT WAS OFF BUT WHEN THE GUY TURNED IT ON IT UM LIKE AT FIRST IT WAS DARK AND YOU COULDN'T REALLY SEE THAT MUCH COLOR BUT THEN WHEN HE TURNED IT ON YOU COULD SEE A LOT OF THE COLOR,AT FIRST THE LIGHT WAS OFF BUT WHEN THE GUY TURNED IT ON IT UM AT FIRST IT WAS DARK AND YOU COULDN'T REALLY SEE THAT MUCH COLOR BUT THEN WHEN HE TURNED IT ON YOU COULD SEE A LOT OF THE COLOR
612,THE LIGHT IS BEING REFLECTED UM TOO MANY TIMES FOR THE LIGHT TO TRAVEL AND THE LIGHT IS LOSING SOME MOST OF IT'S ENERGY AND THEN BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE STAR THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MORE,THE LIGHT IS BEING REFLECTED TOM TOO MANY TIMES FOR THE LIGHT TO TRAVEL AND THE LIGHT IS LOSING SOM MOST OF ITS ENERGY AND THEN BY THE TIME IT GETS THE STAR OF THEREIS NO THERE IS NO MORAL
613,REFLECTING LIGHT OFF OF THE MIRROR IT'S WE USE TO REFLECT TO REFLECT LIGHT OFF OF IT AND THEN AND THEN TO MAKE A REFLECTION ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING,REFLECTING LIGHT OFF OF THE MIRROR ITS BEINOUSE TO REFLECT TO REFLECT LIGHT OFF OF IT AND THEN AND THEN TO MAKE A REFLECTION ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDIN
614,BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS ENTERING THE EYE AND UM AND WE'RE SEEING AND THE GUY SEES COLORS AND IT MOSTLY IN THE LIGHT AND THE IN THE,BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS ENTERING THE EYE AND THE UM IN WERSING IN THE GISIS COLORS AN IT MOSTLY IN THE LIGHT AND THE IN THE WI
615,COAL ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE WIND TURBINE AND THE SOLAR CELL THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE FOSSIL FUELS AND YOU CAN'T RENEW THEM VERY EASILY,SAN COAL ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE WINTERBINE AND THESSOR SO THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THAT THERNON THEIR APOSTLE FIELDS AND YOU CAN'T RENEW THEM VERY EASIL
616,YEAH THERE WAS YEAH THERE WAS UM YEAH THERE THERE'S ONE TIME WHEN MY MOM LIT A CANDLE AND SHE AND I HEARD A POPPING SOUND AND IT WAS FROM THE CAN,THE OTHERE WAS ONE YHE ATHERE WAS A YATHER THERE IS ONE TIME WHEN MY ONE LITTLE CANDLE AND SHE AND I HEARD A POPPING SOUND FROM IT WAS FROM THE CAN
617,A NONRENEWABLE ENERGY YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONCE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE COAL AND THE GASOLINE YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONCE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE COAL AND THE GASOLINE YOU CAN ONLY USE THOSE ONCE BECAUSE THEY'RE A ONE TIME USE AND THEN ALSO UM THAT YOU'D HAVE TO GET MORE UM YOU'D HAVE TO GET MORE TO TO USE IT,A NONRENUABLE ENERGY YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONCE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE CALL AND THE GASOLENE YOU CAN ONLY USE THOSE ONCE AN BECAUSE THERE ARE ONE TIME USE AND THEN ALSO ATHAT YOU'D HAVE TO GET MORE A YOU'D HAVE TO GET MORE TO TO USIT
618,WE USED MOST OF IT UP SO NOW WE HAVE TO GO INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEAS LIKE THE AND THE AND THE DEAD SEA TO ACTUALLY A MORE FOSSIL FUELS LIKE UH GAS LIKE GASOLINE AND,WE USED MOST OF IT UP SO NOW WE HAVE TO GO INTO THE MIDDLE OF SEAS LIKE THE MEDITARIAN IN THE GREED AND THE DEAD SEA TO ACTUALLY GET A MORE FOSSIL FIELDS LIKE A GASIN LIKE GASOLINE AND
619,BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED TO KEEP US WARM AND OTHER THINGS WARM BUT THEN YET AGAIN WE CAN ALSO DO A LOT OF OTHER STUFF WITH IT LIKE MAKE A CAR RUN OR LIKE KEEP OUR BODIES RUNNING,BECAUSE WEIT CAN BE USED TO KEEP US WARM AND OTHER THINGS WARM BUT THEN YET AGAIN WE CAN ALSO DO A LOT OF OTHER STUFF WITH IT LIKE MAKE A CAR RUN OR LIKE KEEP OUR BODIES RUNNING W

702,IF IT DOESN'T GET AIR IT CAN'T PUT THE AIR INTO THE NUTRIENTS SO SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE AIR SUNLIGHT OR WATER IT WON'T LIVE,IF IT DOESN'T GET AIR IT CAN'T PUT THE AIR INTO THE NUTRIANS SO SO AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE AIR SUNLIGHT OR WATER IT WON'T LIVE
703,THEY DON'T BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IT GIVES THEM WATER AND IF IT SNOWS IT STILL GETS THEM WATER BUT IF IT'S HOT IT STILL EATS THE NUTRIENTS AND STAYS ALIVE,BE DON'T BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IT GIVES THEM WATER AND IT SNOILS IT STILL GETS THEM WATER BUT IF IT'S HOT IT STILL EADS THE NUTRIANCE AND STAYS ALIVE
704,FIRST WE LEARNED ABOUT PLANTS AND THEN WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW PLANTS LIVE AND THEN WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW PLANTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE WORLD,FIRST WE LEARNED ABOUT PLANTS AND THEN WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW PLANTS LIVE AND THEN WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW PLANTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE WORLD
705,WHEN THE WATER GOES TO THE GROUND THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND WATER MAKES SUGAR AND IT MAKES THE PLANT GROW,WHEN THE WATER GOES TO THE GROUND THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND WATER CREATES SUGAR AND IT MAKES THE PLANT GROW
706,THE LAST THREE PLANTS PLANTS HAD TWO OF THE THREE THINGS THAT IT NEEDED THIS PLANTS HAS ALL THREE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS,THE LAST THREE PANT PLANTS HAD TWO OF THE THREE THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED THIS PLANT HAS ALL THREE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS
707,I NOTICED THAT THERE'S BACTERIA AND FUNGI AND UM THE RED ARROWS POINT TO THE BACTERIA AND FUNGI THAT ARE FOOD FOR AND THE WHITE THE BLUE ARROWS POINT TO WHAT WHAT THE ANIMALS ARE FOOD FOR THE ANIMAL,A NOTICED THAT THERE'S BACTERIA AN FUNGI AND UM THE RED ARROWS POINT TO THE BACTERIAN FUNGI THAT ARE FOOD FOR AND THE WHITE ARROW THE BLUE ARROWS POINT TO WHAT WHAT THE ANIMALS ARE FOOD FOR THE ANIMAL
708,FOOD WEBS ARE VERY IMPORTANT THEY TELLS US WHAT FOOD IS WHAT'S FOOD FOR WHAT AND WITHOUT THEM WE WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT FOOD WE'D GET,FOOD WEBBS ARE VERY IMPORTANT THEY TELL US WHAT FOOD IS WHAT'S FOOD FOR WHAT AND WITHOUT THEM WE WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT FOOD WE'D GET
709,THE HEART MAKES PUMPS BLOOD AND IT MAKES THE THE BLOOD THERE'S A BUNCH OF CELLS AND THE BLOOD GOES AROUND YOUR BODY TO MAKE IT MOVE,THE HEART MAKES PUMPS BLOOD AND IT MAKES THEM THE BLOOD THERE'S A BUNCH OF CELLS AND THE BLOOD GOES AROUND YOUR BODY TO MAKE YOU MOVE
710,EARTH IS A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE EARTH SPINS ROUND AND ROUND AND PEOPLE ARE ON IT AND PEOPLE ARE SYSTEMS SO TECHNICALLY IT'S ONE BIG SYSTEM,EARTH IS THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE EARTH SPINS ROUND AND ROUND AND PEOPLE ARE N I AND PEOPLE ARE SYSTEMS SO TECHNICALLYTES ONE BIG SYSTEM
711,SYSTEMS HAVE LIKE LET ME THINK FOR A SECOND SYSTEMS HAVE PARTS AND THE SYSTEM IS LIKE A MOVING PART SO THAT'S WHAT THE CAR MOVES SO THAT'S WHAT IT MAKES IT'S A SYSTEM,SYSTEMS HAVE LIKE METHINK FOR A SECOND SYSTEMS HAVE PARTS AND THE SYSTEM IS LIKE A MOVING PART SO THAT'S WHAT THE CAR MOVES SO THAT'S WHAT IT MAKES ITS A SYSTEM
712,THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THERE'S A MOUNTAIN THERE'S A TREE THERE'S HOUSES THERE'S A VOLCANO THERE THERE'S WATER THERE'S A CORAL REEF,THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THERE'S A MOUNTAIN THERE'S A TREE THERE'S HOUSES THERE'S A VOLCANO THER THERE'S WATER THERE'S CORAL REEF
713,THERE ARE A LOT OF SYSTEMS ON EARTH SO THE SYSTEMS ON EARTH AND SO EARTH MAKES THE SYSTEMS SO EARTH IS ONE BIG SYSTEM,THERE ARE A LOT OF SYSTEMS ON EARTH SO THE SYSTEMS ON EARTH AND SO EARTH MAKES THE SYSTEMS SO EARTH IS ONE BAGUE SYSTEM
714,I THINK EARTH IS A SYSTEM BECAUSE IT MOVES ROUND AROUND THE SUN AND THE MOON AND IT WORKS US SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SYSTEM,I THINK EARTH IS SYSTEM BECAUSE IT MOVES ROUND AROUND THE SUN AND THE MOON AND IT WORKS US SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT
715,THE ENGINE THE WHEELS THE WHEEL WHERE YOU CONTROL THE CAR THE WHEEL WHERE YOU CONTROL THE CAR CONTROLS WHAT WHAT WAY THE CAR GOES THERE'S ALSO THE PEDALS THE PEDALS MAKE IT GO AND STOP UM AND THE MOVING WHEELS MAKE IT MOVE,ENGINE THE WHEELS THE WHEEL WHERE YOU CONTROL THE CAR THE WHEEL WHERE YOU CONTROL THE CAR CONTROLS WHAT WAY THE CARGOES IS ALSO THE PETALS THE PETALS MAKE IT GO AND STOP UN AND THE MOVING WHEELS MAKE IT MOVE
716,THE SMALL SACS AT AND THE END OF THE BROCHIOLES IN THE LUNGS ALL THE GAS EXCHANGE IN THE LUNGS HAPPEN IN THE ALVEOLI,THE SMALL SEX DANDO THE BON CIAS IN THE LONGS ALL THE GAS EXCHANGED NMONGS HAPPENS ANABIAY
717,THEY CAN NOT BE THE SAME BECAUSE THE HERBIVORES EAT GRASS AND THE CARNIVORES EAT MEAT SO THEY COULDN'T BE THE SAME CAUSE THEY WOULDN'T EAT THE GRASS AND THE OTHER ANIMALS WOULD NOT EAT THE MEAT THE OMNIVORES WOULD EAT THE BERRIES AND MEAT SO THEY COULD BE LIKE THE HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES DETRIVORES EAT THINGS LIKE THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS THEY EAT THE DEAD ANIMALS SO THEY ARE ALIKE TO EVERYTHING,THEY CANNOT BE THE SAME BECAUSE THE HERBIVORES EAT GRASS AND THE CARNIVORES EAT MEAT SO THEY COULDN'T BE THE SAME CAUSE THEY WOULDN'T EAT THE GRASS AND THEY OTHER ANIMALS WOULD NOT EAT THE MEAT THE OMNIVORES WOULD EAT THE BERRIES AND MEAT SO THEY COULD BE ALIKE TO THE CARNIVORES AND HERBOORES DETEVORES EAT THINGS LIKE DE THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS THEY EAT THE DEAD ANMALS SO THEY ARE ALIKE TO EVERYTHING
718,THESE RED WORMS ARE INTO ROTTING LEAVES AND OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A LITTLE BIT OF SOIL THEY'VE TURNED IT INTO SOIL AS THEY CONSUMED IT AND USED IN THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS,THESE RED WORMS ARE CHANGED INTO LEAVE ROTTING LEAVES AND OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A LITTLE BIT OF SOIL THEY HAVE TURNED IT INTO RICHEND SOIL AS THEY CONSUMED IT AND USE AN THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS
719,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE IT IS SOIL THAT THEY CAN USE FOR PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO GROW AGAIN AND RESTART THE FOOD CHAIN ARE YOU GONNA TALK GEE OH,ITRELATES TO THE MARMENT CAUSE IT AS WRITTEN RICH IN SOIL THAT THEY CAN USE FOR PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO GROW YOUN AND RESTART THE FOOD CHAIN ERAN A TALK
720,THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN A FOOD WEB BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT,THEY ARE IMPORTUNT FOODWIB BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
721,AN OMNIVORE IS ALIKE TO HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES IT GETS ITS FOOD FROM MEAT AND PLANTS JUST LIKE THE CARNIVORES IT EATS MEAT JUST LIKE THE HERBIVORES IT EATS PLANTS IT'S OFF IS IT COME ON WHAT THE,AN OMNIVORE IS LIKE TO HERBEFWORES AND CARNAVRES IT GETS ITS FOOD FROM MEAT AND PLANTS JUST LIKE THE CARNAVORES IT EATS MEAT JUST LIKE THE HERBERWORES IT EATS PLANTS SOF  IS IT TWAN WHAT  OR
722,A DECOMPOSERS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT THE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN OMNIVORE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT'LL ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ANIMALS I WOULD CONSIDER IT A CARNIVORE,A DECOMPOSER IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT THE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED NOMINABLE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT WILL EAT ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ANIMALS I WOULD CONSIDER IT A CARNIBA
723,BEING A PRODUCER IS PROVIDING FOOD FOR OTHER ANIMALS BEING A PRODUCER IS TAKING THE SUNLIGHT FROM IS TAKING LIGHT ATTACHING IT TO ITSELF AND FEEDING ITSELF AND THEN THE ENERGY GOES TO THE CONSUMERS AND THE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY AND THEN THE DECOMPOSERS ONCE THE CONSUMERS DIE EVEN THE DECOMPOSERS GET THE SUNS ENERGY,BEING A PRODUCER IS PROVIDING FOOD FOR OTHER ANIMALS BEING A PRODUCER IS TAKING THE SUNLIGHT FROM THE TAKING LIGHT ATTACHING IT TO ITSELF IN FLEETING ITSELF AND THEN THE ENERGY GOES TO THE CONSUMERS AND THE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY AND THEN THE DECOMPOSERS ONCE THE CONSUMERS DIE EVEN THE DECOMPOSERS GET THE SUN'S ENERGY
724,DECOMPOSERS WOULD EAT THE DEAD SOIL AND THE SOIL INSIDE OF A DEAD PLANT MUSHROOMS WOULD ALSO DO THAT BUT THEY WOULD GROW ON TOP OF IT AND START USING IT FOR FUEL WORMS WOULD ATTACK IT SORT OF LIKE A CARNIVORE,DECOMPOSERS WOULD EAT THE DEAD SOIL AND THE SOIL INSIDE OF A DEAD PLANT MUSHROOMS WOULD ALSO DO THAT BUT THEY WOULD GROW ON TOP OF IT AND START USING IT FOR A FUEL WORMS WOULD ATTACK IT SORT ED LIKE A CARNIVL
725,A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE A CONSUMER OR ANYTHING THAT EATS PLANTS EATS PRODUCERS AND THEN THE PRODUCERS GET THEY ARE CALLED PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THE FOOD FOR THE FIRST LEVEL CONSUMERS,A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE A CONSUMER OR ANYTHING THAT EATS PLANTS EATS THE PRODUCERS AND THEN THE PRODUCERS GET THEY ARE CALLED PRODUCERS ECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THE FOOD FOR THE FIRST LEVEL CONNUMERS
726,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK BASICALLY BUT I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT AND THEY ARE SORT OF EQUAL TO WHAT WE ARE LEARNING,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK MET SICKLY BUT UH I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT END THEY ARE SORT OF EQUAL HERATER INTO WHAT WE ARE LEARN
727,THIS IS A FOOD WEB THE DEER WOULD HARM THE RABBIT AND THE RABBIT WOULD EAT THE GRASS THE LION WOULD HARM THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE POLAR BEAR WOULD GO TO THE LION THE BEAR EATS WOULD GO TO THE MEAT AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE BEAR AND THEN THE BEAR WOULD GO TO THE HUNTER AND SOIL WOULD GO TO A MUSHROOM AND THEN THE AND THEN THE MUSHROOM WOULD GO TO THE WORM,THIS IS A FOOD WEB THE DEER WOULD HARM THE RABBIT AND THE RABBIT WOULD EAT THE GRASS THE LION WOULD HARM THE POLLER BEAR AND TEN  THE MEAT THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE POLLER BEAR ND THEN THE PULLER BEAR WOULD GO TO THE LION THE BERRIES WOULD GO TO THE MEAT AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE BEAR AND THEN THE BEAR WOULD GO TO THE HUNTER AND THE SOIL WOULD GO TO A MUSHROOM AND THEN THE WHOK AND THEN THE MUSHROOM WOULD GO TO THE WORM
728,DECOMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM BECAUSE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS AND THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM THE DEAD CONSUMERS AND THEY GET,DECOMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM BECAUSE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS AND THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM THE DEAD CONSUMERS AND THEY GET
729,A CONSUMER IS SOMETHING THAT CONSUME PRODUCERS WHAT THAT WOULD CONSUME CONSUME PRODUCERS PRODUCERS ARE THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS,A CONSUMER IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD CONSUME PRODUCERS WHAT THAT WOULD CONSUME CO THE CONSUME PRODUCERS PRODUCERS ARE THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCER
730,FIRST OF ALL FIRST OF ALL I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ANATOMY SECOND OF ALL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT ANATOMY IS THIRD OF ALL YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE SO SMART YOU'RE NOT SMART,FIRST OF ALL A FIRST OF ALL I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A NAD AMY SECOND VALL I DON'T KNOW WHETHE ANATOMY IS THIRD OF ALL YOU AC LACK YAS TAT LAT YET I THMOT
731,I SEE LUNGS I SEE BRONCHIOLES I SEE TRACHEA I SEE BRONCHIS I SEE THE MOUTH AND I SEE THE NOSE BABOOM YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALIVE AND YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE SO SMART THAT'S RIGHT RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS,I SEE LONG AS I SEE BRUNKALES I SEE CHAKIA I SEE BRUNK EYES I SEE THE MOUTH AND I SEE THE NOSE BOYOU ARE NOT EVEN LIVE IN YET LIKE THIS LASS MAR THETRE AT YBATH
732,I THINK THE LUNGS ARE PROVIDE THE BODY WITH AIR CARBON DONOXIDE AND OXYGEN OR O TWO AND C O TWO,I THINK TELONGS APROVIDE THE BODY WITH AIR CARBONOXIDE AND OXYGEN OR OTO AND SEAL TO
733,I THINK THAT THE LUNGS PROVIDE AIR TO ALL THE CELLS IN OUR BODY AND GET RID OF C O TWO,I THINK THE THONGS PROVIDE ER TO ALL OURSELVES IN OUR BODY AND GET RADISTEE OUT TO
734,IT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING AND HOW LUNGS WORK I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AIR'S COMING FROM AND I BET THAT GUY'S A MEXICAN,WHAT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING AND HALLONGS WORK BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AIR IS COMING FROM AND ABET TEGSMECTC
735,IF IT IS SOIL THEN OH WOW YES THEY DO NEED SPACE OR ROOM TO GROW BUT THEY DO NOT NEED IT A FULL,IF IT IS SWELL THEN  OH WELL YES THEY DO NEED SPACE OR ROOM TO GROW BUT THEY DO NOT NEED A FULL
736,IT IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE STUDYING ABOUT PLANTS AND ALSO WE GROW WHEAT AND THAT ONE GROWS IN THE DARK THE ONE WITH THE DARKER COLORS,IT IS UM RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE STUDYING ABOUT PLANTS AND ALS SO WE GREW WEAK AND THAT ONE WOTS IN THE DARK FO ONE WITH THE DARKER COLOR
737,IT IS BUILT UP OF MANY GRAVITY PULLS AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE EARTH THE EARTH,IT IS BUILT UP OF MANY GRAVITA POLES AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE EARTH BE ARSE
738,THEY ALL HAVE SOMETHING LIVING INSIDE THEM EXCEPT FOR THE SUITCASE OKAY MAYBE IT HAS A CAT INSIDE OF IT THE T V HAS YEAH,THEY ALL HAVE SOMETHING LIVING INSIDE THEM EXCEPT FOR THE SUIT CASE BOK IT MAYBE HAS A CAT INSIDE OF IT THE T V HAS
739,THE ENGINE THE ENGINE IS USED FOR UM FOR LIKE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES BUT THEY ALL JUST WORK TOGETHER THE WHEELS ARE POWERED BY THE AXLE AND STUFF AND YOU KNOW,THE ENGINE THE ENGINE IS USED FOR UM FOR LIKE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES BUT THEY ALL JUST WORK TOGETHER THE WHEELS ARE POWERED BY THE AXON SNUBBLIN YE
740,THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT PARTS BY THE WAY WHY DO YOU JUST THE LIGHT GREEN WHAT IS IT IS IT JUST NORMAL IS IT YOU JUST TRYING TO TRICK PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME LISTEN TO ME,THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT PARTS BUT BY THE WAY WANTN'T YOU CHELST THE LIE GREEN WHAT IS IT IS IT JUST NORMAL IS IT YOU JUST KYING THE TRICK PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME LISTEN TOME
741,IT IS A SYSTEM GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT EARTH,IT IS A SYSTEM GOD I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THIS DON BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT EARTH
742,BIOSPHERES ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE BIOSPHERE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR,BILE SPHERES ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW AMONG THE BILESPHERE ECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR
743,PEOPLE ANIMALS TRY TO EAT THEM AND WHEN THEY EAT BACTERIA IT GETS INTO HERBIVORE AND IT HAS A POISON GET,PEOPLE ANIMALS SHUDDIN EAT THEM AND WHEN THEY EAT BACTERIA IT GETS IN TOURNER FOR AND IT HAS A POISON GET P
744,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE CAUSE WHEN THEY HAVE IN THE DIRT THEY ARE EATING THROUGH IT AND NATURE BUT IN THIS CASE THEY'RE IN A BALL AND THEY'RE EATING THE DEAD THE SCRAP,IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE CAUSE WHEN THEY HAVE SOO IN THE DIRT THEY ARE EATING THOUG IT IN NATURE BUT IN THIS CASE THERE ARE A BORREL IN THEIR EATING THE DEAD THE SCRAP
745,I NOTICED THAT UM SOME THINGS IT WOULD SOAK THROUGH AND SOME THINGS IT SHOULD JUST SAY THE SAME AND THEN LOOK LIKE A WATER CROP,I NOTICED THAT ON SOME THINGS IT WOULD SOAK THROUGH IN SOMETHING TO JUST SAY THE SAME THAN LOOKED LIKE A WATER DROP
746,ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT DID THE SAME THING IT EXPLODED BUT THEN IT JUST TURNED INTO A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER AND SOAKED THROUGH SO IT KINDA JUST FAILED,ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT DID THE SAME THING EXPLODED BUT THEN IT JUST TURNED INTO A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER AND SOAKED THROUGH SORCONAJUST FAILED
747,YEAH IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE S IT AS ON THE SOAPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS,IT'S MORE LONG ON THE I MEAN IT'S NOT AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER ON THE IT AS ON THE SOPY WATER IT ISN'T AS TALL AS THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENT
748,WELL ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT'S STAYING FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF,WELL ON THE SOPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH STAINE FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF
749,THAT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MICROSCOPE IT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER ONCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY,THAT WEN YER WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN IT KEEPS GITTING BIGGER AND AN IT KINDA LIKE A MECROSCOPE THAT MAKES THE PENNY LOOK BIGGER WHENCE YOU GET ALL THE WAY
750,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN WE'RE WE WERE SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER AND SALT WATER ON THE PENNY,WORKING WITH WATER AGAIN TE BIRD SING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT SOAPY WATER REGULAR WATER IN SALT WATER ON THE PENNY
751,OH UM WELL WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF ONCE YOU G PUT A LOT ON IT WILL START COMING OFF Y OR ELSE IT'LL START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP,OH EM WELL IF YOU PUT WATER ON A PENNY IT WILL KEEP KITTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT IF WONCE YOU PUT A LOT ON IL STIRT COMING OFF ORLE START MAKING ANOTHER ONE ON TOP
752,HAVE N WELL CAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER,HAVE WELL BECAUSE THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER THAN THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AD BIGER AN BIGGER AN BIGGER AND BIGGER AN BIGGER ND BIGGER AND BIGGER
753,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFACE IT'S ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IS IT IS ON ON SOME SURFACES IT'LL JUST EXPLODE AND YEAH,BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JUST THE SURFEITS ITS ON IT DEPENDS WHAT IS IT IS ONT ON SOME SURFACES ILL JUST EXPLODE IN YET
754,ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S HITS AND IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT TAKES OUT SOME OF THE WATER,ON THE SOPY WATTER IT HITS AN IT GOES DOWN AND THEN POPS UP SO THAT MAKES IT SO IT DOTS 'N IT DOESN'TT IT TAKES SHOUT SOME OF THE WATER
755,UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF,I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF
756,IT IS TALLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP MORE OF THE WATER SO IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T ASORB SOAP CA TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO N IT HA TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH,IT IS COLLER BECAUSE SALT SOAKS UP WARE OF THE WATER SOA IT DOESN'T TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM WHEN YOU PUT ON WATER AND ON THE SOAPY WATER IT HAS SOAP AND SOAP DOESN'T AS ORB SOAP CUT TAKES OUT AND SO THE SOAP MAKES IT SO IT THAT TAKES UP MORE ROOM AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET AS HIGH
757,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,ON SOME OF THE ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS HIGHER BUT ON SOME OF THE WATERS IT GETS LOWER SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
758,UM WELL IT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OH WHAT WAS I GONNA CALL IT UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET,UM BUIT WORKED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY OH WHAT WAS A CALLED UM WELL THEY WORKED ALL THE TIME SO UM THEY WERE PROBABLY JUST A MAGNET BUT THIS ONE PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A MAGNET
759,CAUSE WE HA WE LEARNED AND WITH THE MAGNETS FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL,CAUSE WE WE LEARNED WITH THE MAGNETS THAT FOR SOMETHING TO PICK IT UP IT HAS TO BE IRON HAS TO HAVE IRON IN THAT METAL
760,YOU COULD JUST USE IT FOR FOR CARRYING PLACES THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES EXCEPT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT THAT'D BE PRETTY BAD,COULD JUST USE IT FRUIT FOR CARING PLACE THINGS FOR LONG DISTANCES SUDDEN  THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT AM PRETTY BAD
761,UM CAUSE IT WOULD JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY LIKE GET LESS AND LESS AND LESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES MMM HMM,AH BECAUSE I JUST USE UP ALL THE ENERGY I GET LESS AND LESS AND ELESS AND THEN FINALLY JUST DIES
762,UM OH LETS SEE THE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE HAVE NO CLUE YEAH ENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS,LETSEE MORE TIGHTLY YOU DID I THINK THE MORE IHAVE NO CLOYE YENERGY OR THE MORE POWERFUL IT WAS
763,OKAY UM SO TODAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING,UNC UM SO TO DAY WE UM WE WERE MAKING ELETRO MAGNETS BUT ALSO WE WERE TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS WITH ELECTROMAGNETS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING
764,WELL ELECTROMAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THE THESE WERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP SINCE THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM,OH ELECTRO MAGNET IS JUST METAL AND THATHESE WERE ROUD ON WHAT SUBSTANCE THEY WERE BUT THERE SORT OF ROCK SORT OF OLD THAT'S WHAT I CALL
765,TO TEST THE MORE WRAPS OH YEAH LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN WRAPS AND THEN WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN WRAPS MY GROUP THEN UM GOT ZERO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN AND THEN FOR FIFTY WRAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS MMM HMM,TTESTEMORE RAPS OH YA LAST WEEK WE HAD TEN RAPS AND THE WE HAD TO CHART THAT SO FOR TEN RAPS MIGHT GROUP THEN UM GOD CYRO BUT FOR TWENTY WE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN THEN FOR FIFTY RAPS WE GOT TWENTY FIVE WASHERS
766,UM WELL YOU COULD CARRY SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNET YOU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WITH LIKE A CAR MMM HMM UH HUH,A WELL YOU COULD CARRY YOU SOMETHING AND THEN DROP IT OVER THERE BUT WITH A MAGNETE YOUU JUST CARRY IT AND CARRY IT AND YOU COULDN'T DROP IT YOUD HAVE TO PULL IT OFF WHICH WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK WIT LIKE A CAR ON A
767,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WELL WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR IN THE MAGNET CAUSE WE LEARNED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETISM WELL THE MAGNET UNIT UM THAT IT CAN AS THE IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO IT'D BE MORE POWERFUL IF YOU PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET,SO I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET WORLD WHICH IS THE BIGGER POINT UM TO AS THAT DOES N'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR AN THE MAGNET COULD BE LEARNT AT THE BEGINNING OF MAGNETLE THE MAGNET UNIT U THAT I AS THA IT TRAVELS THE MAGNETISM GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER SO I BE MORE POWERFUL IF HE PUT IT BY THE HEAD OF THE MAGNET
768,IT'S I THINK IT'S WELL UM WELL THEY USUALLY USE IT AT DUMPSTERS TO PICK UP WELL PLACES GARBAGE HEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM,IT'S I THINK IT'S YORK  AN WHILE THEY USUALLY USED IT AT DUMSTERS TO PICK UP TE PLACES GARBAGE SHEAPS TO PICK UP CARS AND THINGS AND MOVE THEM
769,THE RIVET IT'S UM IT'S ALL WELL IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICIS AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAG WELL I'D SAY WASHERS UH HUH SO THAT YEAH,THE RIVER IT'S AM IT'S A BOLT SOMETHING THAT CAN CARRY ELECE TRESSES AND SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE MAGBLE WIDE SAY WASHERS USO AS YET
770,UM LET'S SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVE IT MORE ENERGY ES CAUSE IT'S CLOSER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD IT WOULD BE MORE IT'D BE UH HUH,UM YULL SEE I THINK THAT IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY ISCAUSE IT'S CLOSER DOES IT HAVE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THE MORE WRAPPINGS THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD BE AND THE CLOSER TO THE HEAD ITOULD BE MORE EYD BE
771,YEAH BEFORE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END AND IT WOULDN'T PICK ANYTHING UP,YEAH BEFORE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED MAKING LUCTRO MAGNETS WE WERE WRAPPING IT AT THE END IN A WOODEN POKE ANYTHING OF
772,WE TRIED TO SEE DID IT MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO THE H HOW DOES IT DO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE,WE TRIED TO SEE DIDN'T MATTER HOW THICK THE WIRE WAS AND HOW TIGHT DO HOUT DOS DIP  MATTER HOW TIGHT THE COILS ARE
773,WELL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE IN THE ELECTRICI ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY MMM HMM,WILL WE HAD THE RIVET AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PICKS UP THE WASHERS WHICH WERE THE CARS AND UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE WIRES WHICH TRANSPORT THE THE ELECELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTERY
774,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD'VE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE MAG UM WELL A ELECTRICITY SO UM,THICKNESS WELL IT COULD HAVE IT COULD HAVE EITHER EVEN MORE RUBBER OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WIRE TO CARRY MORE NA UM W ELECTRICITY SO A
775,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP,I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDT OF IT AND WANT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WIPOB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
776,THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP,THE WHITE BALB IS NOTGETING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSEERES NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IS NOT LIGHTING UP
777,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A M NOT MAG A UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT UP,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO PUT WIRES ON A NIT UM BATTERY AND THEN TRY TO MAKE A LIPE BLL UNLIGHT UP
778,UM SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS,SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT LIKE IF YOU TAKE ONE END OF THE NEGATIVE AND PUT IT WHERE THE POSITIVE IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE WHITE BALB IT'LL SHOCK YOUR FINGERS
779,YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BULB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE,OU ATTACH THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE SO THAT THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES OUT ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE ENERGY COMES OUT FROM THE BALB AND GOES BACK INTO ITS SIDE
780,I ATTACHED TWO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCKED MY FINGER,I ATTACHED TO WIRES TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE RIGHT AREAS AND THEN BUT THE FIRST TIME I ATTACHED THEM BOTH TO THE BOTTOM I REALLY SHOCK MY FINGER
781,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,WELL AS YOU SAID THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUIT IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE CONDUCING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE WIRES IN THAT A CLOSE CIRCUIT
782,THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT F IF WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE AND POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM,THE WHITEBOB CAN LIGHT UP WHEN YOU ATTACH THE RIGHT IF WHEN YOU ATTACH NEGATIVE ON THE SIDE IN POSITIVE ON THE BOTTOM
783,CELLS ARE NINE NINE ARE NINE VOLT BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB M LIGHT UP,SELLS AR NINE NUN AR NINE BOAT BATTERIES AND YOU CAN ATTACH WIRES TO THEM TO MAKE THE LIGHT BUB LIGHT UP
784,THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF,THE BALB SHOWS YOU OF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AN THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
785,THE GREEN AREAS BY OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS INSIDE OF THE UM D CELL AND ON ONE SIDE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S THAT ONE UM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT'S SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND KNOW WHICH ONE WHICH SIDE SWITCHED,THE GREEN AREAS CLOSED OFF THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS IN SIDE OF THE I'M DESAIL IN ON ONE SIDE ON THEEPOSITIVE SIDE THERE'S TAT ONE OM THING THAT STICKS OUT AND THAT SO THAT YOU CAN ATTACH ONE WIRE TO ONE WIRE AND NOTWHITCH I DWITCHED
786,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE UM,THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE GOING UP THROUGH THE CONDUCING ARMS AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT INTO THE
787,IT LETS THE WIRES GET ENERGY SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE LIGHT IT CAN UM LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES,IT LETS THE WIRES GET IN HER CEE SO THAT WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE WHIHT IT CAN UNLIGHT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE POWER THAT' WUN THROUGH THE WIRES
788,THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WIRES IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE D CELL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE IT WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE,THERE ISN'T A PATHWAY THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH OR THROUGH OR THE LIGHTBALL BUSN'T THERE IF YOU JUST ATTACH THOSE TWO WILERS IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK THE DESAIL WILL RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE NONE OF THE ENERGY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACH BACK TO THE UM POSITIVE SIDE  WILL ONLY KEEP GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT BACKS UP EACH SIDE
789,WELL THE BATTERY'S A D CELL AND IT HAS POG POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE LIGHT BULB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIRE,WHILE THE BATTERY IS A DESAILL AND IT HAS POGPOSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE WHITE BALB HAS TWO PLACES FOR A WIRE
790,THE CONDUCTING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM AND TO THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES IT LIGHTS UP,E CONDUCTING ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM INTO THE SIDE SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES THAT LIGHTS UP
791,IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST CIRCUIT THOUGH THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL COMING BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT,IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST TIRCUIT THOUGH THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL COMING BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT
792,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO UM THEY'RE TRYING TO UM GET ATTRACTED AND YOU CAN MOVE THE BOTTOM ONE THE TOP ONE WILL MOVE TOO,WELL THE TWO MANAGES ARE TRYING TO UM THE TRYING TO UM GET ATTRACTED AND YOU CAN MOVE THE BOTTOM ONE THE TOP ON'LL MOVE TO
793,AND ON THE THICK AND ON THE THICK PIECE OF ON THE THICK STACK IT IT CANNOT ATTACH TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GET TO THE TOP,AND ON THE THICK AND ON THE HICK PIECE OF ON THE THICK STACK IT IT CANNOT ATTACH TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH PAPER AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GET TO THE TOP
794,THE MAGNET IN THE MAGNET IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE PAPERCLIP THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GO THROUGH ALL THE PIECES OF PAPER TO TRY TO GET THE TO TRY TO GET THE PAPERCLIP,THE MAGNET THE MAGNET IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE PAPER CLIP THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE CANNOT GO THROUGH ALL THE PIECES OF PAPER TO TRY TO GET THEM TO TRY TO GET THE PAPER CLIP
795,WHEN YOU DROPPED THE MAGNET AND IT WENT UNDER THE TABLE YOU MOVED THE TOP YOU MOVED THE BOTTOM MAGNET S AND IT AND IT MOVED THE TOP MAGNET AROUND THE TABLE,WHEN YOU DROPPED THE MAGNET ET WENT UNDER THE TABLE YOU MOVED THE TOP YOU MOVED THE BOTTOM MAGNET  IN IT AND IT MOVED THE TOP MAGNET AROUND THE TABLE
796,THE THICK STACK IS TOO THICK FOR THE MAGNET TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERCLIP AND THE THIN STACK IS ABLE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT CAN GO THROUGH,THE THICK STACK IS TOO THICK FOR THE MAGNET TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AND THE THIN STACK IS ABLE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT CAN GO THROUGH
797,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS REPEL EACH BECAUSE ONE HAS UM ONE SIDE OF THE MAGNET THAT DOESN'T WANT TO STICK TO THE OTHER SO IT'S CALLED REPELLING,WELL THE TWO MAGNETS REPEL EACH OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS ON ONE SIDE IS A MAGNET THAT DOES MONASTIC TO THE OTHER SORTS CALLED REPELLEN
798,ONE S ONE UM STACK OF PAPER HAS IS TOO THICK SO THAT THE MAGNET FORCE CANNOT PICK UP CANNOT KEEP THE PAPERCLIP ON AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THIN SO THAT IT CAN KEEP THE PAPERCLIP ON,EN ONE ON STOCK OF PAPER HAS IS TWO STICK SO THAT THE MAGNET FOREST CANNOT PICK CANNOOT KEEP T PAPER CLIP ON AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS TAND SO THAT IT CAN KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON
799,THE PAPER IS SO THIN THAT THE MAGNET THE MAGNET FORCE CAN TOUCH THE UM TOUCH THE UM PAPERCLIP SO IT CAN MOVE AROUND,THE PAPER IS SO THIN THAT THE MAGNET THE MAGNET FORCE CAN TOUCH THE ARM TOUCH THE ON PAPER CLIP SO IT CAN MOVE AROUD
800,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED AND WHEN Y WHEN YOU DROP THE FIRST ONE AND IT WENT UNDER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE IT'S BECAUSE THAT THE FIRST MAGNET THAT WAS ON THE TABLE ORIGINALLY HAD A REALLY HIGH MAGNET MAGNETISM FORCE SO WHEN IT CAME DOWN IT WOULD ATTACK IT WOULD ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNET,TO WHOM MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED AND WHEN WHEN YOU DROP THE FIRST ONE IN IT WHENT UNDER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE ITS BECAUSE THAT THE FIRST MAGNET THAT WAS ON THER TABLE ORIGINALLY HAD A REALLY HIGH MAGNET MAGNETISM FORCE SO WHEN IT CAME DOWN IT WOULD ATTACK IT WOULD ATTRACT THE OTHER MAGNET
801,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS WE OBSERVED WITH TWO MAGNETS ON TABLE ON A TABLE LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU SHOWED SO WE WE COU WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THE BOTTOM SO THAT'S HOW I KNOW THE QUESTION,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS WE OBSERVED WITH TWO MAGNETS ON TABLE ON A TABLE LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU SHOWED SO WE COULD WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THE BOTTOM TO THAT TIME NO THE QUESTION
802,T THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PUSHING IS TRYING TO GET THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT TOGETHER TO UM TO MOVE,THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PUSHING IS TRYING TO GET THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT TOGETHER TO AM TO MOVE
803,MAGNETISM IS ABOUT WHEN M YOU HAVE A MAGNET AND YOU CAN PUT IT ON A NAIL AND THE MAGNET FORCE CAN GO THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICK UP A PAPERCLIP,MAGNETISM IS ABOUT WIN YOU HAVE A MAGNET AND YOU CAN PUT IT ON A NAIL IN THE MAGNET FORCE KINGLE THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICK UP A PAPER CLUT
804,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE THE THE TABLE HA ISN'T SO THICK SO THAT THE TWO MAGNETS CAN ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT TOGETHER,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE THE THE TABLE ISN'T SO THICK SO THAT THE TWO MAGNATECAN ARE ABLE TO ATTTRACT TOGETHER
805,BECAUSE A WIRE IS LIKE A CONDUCER BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON LIKE A NAIL OR PAPER CLIP SO THAT IT CAN CONDUCT ELECTRICITY,BECAUSE A WIRE IS LIKE IKE A CONDUCI BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON LIKE A NAIL OR PAPER CLUP SO THAT IT CAN CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
806,WHEN THE STRAW IS TRYING TO DID WHAT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT'S STILL OPEN,WHEN THE STRAW IS TRYING TO DO BUT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSE CIRCUIT IS STILL OPEN
807,WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK,WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METLE IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
808,IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH AND IT'S CLOSED AND YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR AND ATTACH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH THE SWITCH WILL START UM THE SWITCH WILL START WORKING AND THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB WILL GO ON,IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH AND ITS CLOSE AND YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR AND ATTACH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH THE SWITCH WILL START UM THE WICH WILL START WORKING AND THE MOTOR OR LIBALB WILL GO ON
809,A NAIL CAN MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE L SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTOR S,ANAIL COULD MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTER
810,WHEN THE NAIL TOUCHES THE CONDUCTOR WELL WHEN THE NAIL IS THE CONDUCTOR AND IT TOUCHES THE SWITCH IN THE END OF THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND,WHEN THE NAIL TOUCHES THE CONDUCTOR BUT WHEN THE NAIL IS THE CONDUCTOR AND IT TOUCHES THE SWITCH IN THE IND OF THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND
811,I THINK WE HAVE PARALLELS BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE IT ISN'T AS DIM AS WELL IT'S NOT AS DIM AS ONE CIRCUIT BUT IT'S AS IT'S LIGHTER THAN THAT CIRCUIT BUT IT'S THE SAME CIRCUIT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS,I THINK WE HAVE PARALLELS BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE IT ISN'T AS DIM AS WELL IT'S NOT AS DIM AS ONE CIRCUIT BUT IT DOES ITS LIGHTERS IN THAT CIRCUIT BUTS THE SAME CIRCUIT SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS
812,IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONES THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL,IT HAS TWOLIPE BUBS IN ONE BATTERY THE OTHER ONE SID WE'VE HAD HAVE TWO LIKE BUBS IN ONE BATTERY BUT THEY'RE NOT PARALLEL
813,GOES BACK IN THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,OES BACK IN THE DETAIL ON THE POSITTIVE SIDE AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK DOWN TO THE NEGATIVE AND REPEATS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
814,WELL THAT THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB REPRESENTS THE TWO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IT'S IN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT UM AND HOW IT WORKS,WELL THAT THE THE BATTERY REPRESENTS THE TWO LINES AND THEN THE LIGHT BALL PRESENTS THE TO THE WHITE BALB BECAUSE IF YOU SCROLL OVER THERE IT ITSIN ONE END IT ATTACHES LIKE IN THE UM SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT U AND HOW IT WORKS
815,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS,THAT IF IT'S THROUGH PARALLEL CIRCUITIS A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE AN HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
816,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN UM A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THROW F FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES,WELL IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN A A HOUSE HAS ELECTRICITY AND CHOS INTERESTING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY THROUGH FLOWS THROUGH MY HOUSE AND STUFFED LIKE THAT LIKE I WENT HOME AND I OPENED UP MY CIRCUIT BOX AND MY DAD SHOWED ME A PLACE IN OUR WALL WHERE THERE ISN'T ANY WALLING AND I GOT TO SEE ALL THE WIRES
817,WELL SINCE OUR LIGHT ARE STILL LIT UP LIKE IN OUR DOWNSTAIRS THEY ARE REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IN ONE ROOM IT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY STARTS IN OUR HOUSE AND LIGHTS IT UP A LOT BRIGHT BRIGHTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE,WELL SINCE OUR A LIGHT OR SO LIT UP LIKE IN OR DOWNSTAIRS THEY ARE REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IN ONE ROOM IT'S WEAR THE ELECTRICITY STARTS IN OUR HOUSE AND MIGHT SIT UP ELABRAT BRIGHTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
818,THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULBS AND ETC ETC,THE BLUE DOT ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES LIGHTING A FLI BALB AND GOING BOUT THROUGH THE DESAIL LIGHTING UP THE LIPOBS AND ET CETERA ET CETERA
819,THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT,THE PARALLEL CIR COUL DARE NOT SHARING TO THEY WITE UP WATHER THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRIC TO DE SO THAF THEY DON'T LIGT UP APRAT
820,IT IS GOING THROUGH ONE END OF THE D CELL LIGHTING UP THE BULB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL LIGHTING BULBS UP AGAIN AND THEN GOING AND THEN JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,IT IS GOING THROUGH ANE AND OF THE DEE SAIL WLIDING UP THE BALB AND THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE DEE SAIL HINDING THE BULBS UP AGAIN AND IN  JUST REPEATING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
821,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE D CELL FLOW THROUGH THROW THROUGH ONE HI ONE LIGHT BULB LIGHTED UP AND THEN COME BACK TO THE D CELL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND COME BACK TO THE D CELL,THE WIRES ARE LETTING ONE WIRE IS LETTING THE DESAIL FLOW THROUGH THROW THROUGH ONE IT ONE LIGHT BALL BLIGHTED UP AND NCOME BACK TO THE ESAILL THEN THE OTHER ENERGIES TAKE OFF GO THROUGH LIGHT UP THE OTHER LIGHT BALB AND COME BACK TO THE DESAIL
822,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL COMING OUT OF THE OTHER END LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST GOING THROUGH A THIN A THIN WIRE AND THE LIGHT BULB THEN GOING BACK THROUGH THE D CELL AND REPEATING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN,THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH THE DECEIL COMING OUT THE OTHER END LIGHTING OUT THE LIGHT BALB WHICH THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY JUST THROWING THROUGH IT A SIN WIRE IN THE LIGHTBALB  THEN GOING BACK THROUGH THE DECEILL AND REPEATING THAT JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN
823,THE D CELL IS LETTING ENERGY THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY,THE DESAIL I LETTING ENERGIES THROUGH BOTH WIRES SO THAT IT LETS BOTH LIGHT BALLS LIGHT UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY
824,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH LIGHT BULB SO THAT IT LIGHTS IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT THAN THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS,THERE IS ONE PATHWAY FOR EACH WHITE BALL SO THAT IT WITES IT UP MORE THAN OTHER CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING THE ACTRICITY AND THAT IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCUIT WATHER THAN THIS IS JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS
825,M WELL THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL CAUSE UM SINCE THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WIDTH ER THEY'RE ALL WIDER,EM W THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS BUT THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT IN AMOUNTS IS CAUSE THEY'RE WIDER I THINK WELL BECAUSE M SINC THY'R ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THEY'RE NOT ALL GOIN  HETHEY'RE IN THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ANSWERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL CERTAIN THEY THEY'RE ALL DIFFER FRM AN THE ELEVA DIFFERENT WITH THEY'RE ALL WIDER
826,WELL WIDENESS IT DEPENDS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UM SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ONE FOOT WIDE AND A CIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE AND THE OTHER'S JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S WIDER HAS MORE ROOM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT UM WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE UM LEARNED IN FOURTH GRADE THAT IF YOU S IF THAT THE BUGS THAT WALK ON WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THEY'LL FLOAT SO WITH THE BIG BOAT THAT'S WITH THE WIDER BOAT CUP BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FLOAT BETTER AND HOLD MORE PASSENGERS,WELL WIDENESS IT DEPENDS LIK I MEAN IF YOU HAVE HEM SOMETHING THAT'S A ONE FOOT WIDE AND MUST CIR CIRCLE ONE FOOT WIDE THE OTHER JUST LIKE AN INCH THE OTHER OTHER ONE WILL FLOAT BETTER AND IT WILL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS SINCE IT'S  WIDEN AS MORE RUM AND IT'LL FLOAT BETTER BECAUSE IT ON WELL IT'LL FLOAT BETTER ECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE ON LEARNED AND FORTHGREAT THAT IF YOU IF THAT THE BUG'S AT A WALK IN WATER THEY SPREAD THEIR WEIGHT EVENLY SO THAT THELL FLOAT SOWO WITH A BIG BOAT IT'S WITH  WIDER BOAT CUP U WONT OR BOAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'LL JUST FOT BETTER HOME WARD PASSENGERS
827,L FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO SPREAD 'EM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK 'EM TO ALL ONE SIDE ELSE YOU WON'T GET THE ANSWER YOU NEED TO KIND OF SPREAD 'EM EVENLY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS UM MY PARTNER WE HAD THE SAME BOAT THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USED THE SAME ONE HE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURED OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN 'EM OUT,OU FIRST WELL YOU NEED HA SPREAD HIM EVENLY YOU CAN'T STACK EM ALL TO ONE SIDE ELSE HE WON'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER NEED TO FIND IM SPREAD HIM EVILLY AROUND THE BOAT CAUSE YESTERDAY WE WORKED WITH PARTNERS O MY PARTNER WE HAT THE SAME BEAW THE EXACT SAME ONE WE USE THE SAME ONE HE GOT THE ANSWER NINE PENNIES BUT THEN I FIGURE I WAS ACTUALLY FOURTEEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN IM OUT
828,WELL I'D WELL I'D WELL FIRST I'D LIKE PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT PENNIES IN THEN YOU WANT TO PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YEAH CAUSE YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK CAUSE IF IF EIGHT WITH EIGHT PENNIES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL UM IF THEY IF EIGHT PENNIES SINKS IT THEN THE RESULTS WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES,WERE RIGHT WELL I'D WELL FIRST I PUT THE BOAT OR CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU ANHT TO PUT PENNIES IN  THENYOU AN'T PUT AS MANY PENNIES IN AS YOU CAN BUT AND THEN YOU YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK AND THAT'S YOUR ANSWER LIKE YOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT INK CUT AS IF IF EIGHT WITH EIGHT PENNIES IT SINKS THEN THEN IT WILL OM IF IF EIGHT PENNIES SINKS IT THEN THE RESULTS WOULD BE SEVEN PENNIES
829,WELL UM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PENNIES LIKE ALL TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD KIND OF START TO TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF YOU EVEN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LL JUST STAY EVEN AND AND AND UM IT'LL FLOAT BIT BETTER,WELL EM IF YOU LIKE PUT THE PE PENNIES LIKE ALL TO ONE ONE SIDE TO IT TINDA STARTED TIP BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR SIDE BUT IF HE EATN IT OUT IT'LL IT WON'T TIP TO ANY SIDE IT'LE JUST A EVENVNT AND AND ON MIDDLE FLOAT BIT BETTER
830,UM I THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF UM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU GOT UM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE AFFECT THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THAT IT MIGHT SO THAT ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE,ERM I WELL I THOUGHT OF EM MAINLY HOW LIKE WIDE THEY ARE LIKE A FEW GOT EM LET'S SAY ONE OF THOSE BIG CLASS OF CUPS AND JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN IF THE SAME HEIGHT IT CAN STILL LIKE EFFECT O THEM CAUSE ONE'S WIDER AND THE OTHER CAN BE LESS WIDE SO THA MIGHT SO THAT ONE MIGHT FLOAT MORE
831,UM WELL THERE ONE H ONE UM CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD THE WEIGHT'S EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER S SIDE THERE'S T TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S STARTING TO TIP THAT WAY AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORE IT'S GONNA TIP COMPLETELY AND IT'LL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK,UH WELL THERE ONE PE ONE UN CUP IT'S ALL CENTERED SO IT'S EVENLY SPREAD A THE WEIGHTS EVEN BUT ON THE OTHER'S SIDE THERE'S TOO MANY ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT'S LEARNT TO TIP THAT WAY AND IF YOU ADD A FEW MORDS GOING TO TIP COMPLETELY AN ADL JUST FILL WITH WATER AND SINK W
832,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HEIGHTS AND ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY WANNA TEST WHICH ONE WILL HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATER,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS AND LOOKS LIKE IN ABOUT HITES AND ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY WANT A TEST WHICH H WISONE WHO HOLD THE MOST PASSENGERS OR WHICH HOLDS THE MOST WATERR
833,UM IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WHOEVER'S TRYING TO TEST IS SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECA SEEING UM IF A SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AND YEAH,AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE WHOEVER IS TRYING TO TEST AS SEEING IF THE HEIGHT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BESEEING EM IF THE SMALLER ONE HOLDS MORE THE BIGGER ONE AND THE YE
834,WELL I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A LIKE A KIND OF WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT COULD FILL WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE'S A TON OF WAVES AND IT DID SEE IT TI IT SWIVELS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST STAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST STAY FLAT IF IT THE WATER'S CALM IT WORKS BETTER,WELL I MEAN IF HE HAVE LIKE A ON A WAVES AND IT'S JUST GOING EVERYWHERE THE BOAT UT FILLE WITH WATER AND SINK FASTER AND IT COULD JUST TIP IF THERE'S A TUN A WAVES AND IT DOES SEE IT TIT IT SWIVERLS FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT IF IT'S CALM THEN IT'LL JUST SAY IT WON'T REALLY MOVE THAT MUCH IT'LL JUST SAY FLADEN IF IT THE WATERS CALM IT IT WORKS BETTER
835,UM WHEN WE MADE THE BOATS WELL WE WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW MANY PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH WATER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF THE WELL NO BUT UM IF LIKE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT,UM WHEN WE MAKE THE BOATS WELL E WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LIKE HOWMY PENNIES THIY CAN HOLD OR HOW HOW MUCH WATERER THEY WOULD HOLD AND UM IF THER HOT WELL NOW BUT UM IF THE THE SIZE AFFECTS IT
836,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF THERE IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME JUST SEE IF IT'LL AFFECT IT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,ON THE VARIABLES AR LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT ISM WELL A FEW CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF ITWAS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU EOSE YOUSUALLY CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME AN A FEW CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME TO SEE IF ITL EFFECT IT AT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
837,UH LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH,LOOKS LIKE THE TRYING TO FIG OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN NUR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH
838,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT WELL RECORDING INFORMATION LIKE LET'S SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING A FORTY CENTIMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN ON THE GRAPH WE WE DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE LIKE A TOWER ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION,ONA GRAP IS ABOUT  WELL RECORDING YOUR INFORMATIONN LIKE LET SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTER METER STRING OF FORTY CENTAMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTA METER STRING AND ON THE GRAPH WE'D WE'D DO THE THIRTY CENTE METERS STRING AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALL WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE'D MAKE A A TOWER ALL THE WAY UP TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION
839,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PER PAPER AIRPLANES AND VARIABLES THAT ARE FO UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPERCLIP AND TAPE AND IT FLIES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,AH YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE ELSE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PARPAPER AERPLANES AND VARIABLE SET O FOM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPER CLIP AND TAPE AND FLIES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
840,UM VARIABLE IS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD AFFECT IT,AMVARIABLE ASS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE ON THE VARABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF HAT COULD EFFECT IT
841,M WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID LIKE IT UM SWUNG MORE MORE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE,WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID T DELI I DOM SWUNG MORE MORE'N FIFTEEN SECONDS SO ON IN THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWAING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE
842,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT CONTROLLED,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY AM HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO HATS WHAT MAKES A CONTROL
843,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SIZED OF PAPERCLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPERCLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL AM WE KEPT LIKE THIR DFFERENT SIZE PAPER CLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPER CLIPE THE WHOLE TIME AND IM WEL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YET HIS PRERY MUCH IT
844,NO WELL THE PAPERCLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPERCLIP SIZE,NE WEL THE PAPER CLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPER CLIP SIZE
845,OKAY WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS OF THE BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT,AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUM SMOOTHE AND IF THOU MASSIV THE BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT
846,UM THE WAY WE SHOWED THE RESULT IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT LIKE WELL WE HELD IT AND WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER,AND WEN WE SHOWED THE RESULT IS AUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT PLANE WHEL WE HELD IT AND WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIME DOESN'T SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER
847,UM WELL THIS KIND OF CONNECTS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU CAN DO TO SHOWS ALL THE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT JUST LIKE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR LIKE THE SLOPE LIKE RIGHT HERE,SO THIS IS THIS KIND THISISIS EXACT LIKE OUR PLANE EXCEPT WE HAVEN'T C WE I THINK WE MIGHT CHANGE THE UM
848,WELL WE FIGURED OUT IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT,WELL WE FEAR I TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS SHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINCE TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS IS HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAFT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ITS CORRECT
849,UM THE RUBBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES GETS IT TO MOVE,ON THE RUBBER BAND IT'S IS THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND LIKE THE ENGIN THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES SCETZA TO MOVE
850,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,O MA IT LOOKS LIKE MISS ROBOTT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR THE PLAIN WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINES AND YE
851,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,UM BUT WE'RE JUST EARN THE JUST CAN TI MAKE A COOLOOKONCHOUTAND LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER WITH A RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'SCANI LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE IM YOUHAT THE PROPELLER POWERAN AND THEN WRGING TO TRIPUNNING PASSENGERS RON TO SEE IF IT EFFECTS IT WHICH AR THE PASSENGERSE ARE PAPER ECLIPSE AND YE
852,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERDS THAT THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST GING TO SIT THERE
853,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT TE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USED TO BUILD IT THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
854,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THE THE FIGHT FLAGHTLINE LOOKS LIKE ITS GOING UP WORD AND YE HAD LOOK WELL AVE LOOKS LIKE IT TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YE
855,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,AM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLAIN AND THIS YER WEALL SEE HOW FAR IT'S CAN IT GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE A PRETTY FAR FORMED METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINES SO YEH
856,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH I TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT I ELSO NEED SOME WE ELSE SO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRE IS TO GO IN AND READ ME LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE WORLDS LIKE STAY ON SET THE WIRE QUARK WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YAN I WE JUST KIND TO HAVE PAPER UP TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
857,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO WHERE HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S THAT YOU CAN DECIDE BUT T E HOW FAST YOU WANTED TO GO HOW FAR ISROLLA DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE
