225,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEY'LL BE AFFECTED BY GETTING  BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
226,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THRO
227,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
228,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONCE A PATHWAY
229,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,UT WHEN WE AD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEKOR
230,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ASO TE LITS CAV ECASOF FOR THE C
231,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR ITS USED TO
232,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,WHICH IF THE PRISOM IS CAGINGIC COLOR
233,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,AND WOULD LA HAVE TE REFERCTUN OF A CAREER S TAT O NOW
234,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,THE LIGHT IS REFLEEDI RALIBOL
235,THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR,THE REFLEXER WAS USED TO TO MIXING THE COLO
236,UM IT'S REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE OR THE,NO EQUIT WE AM BUT NATS REFLECTING OFF IS A BLUE O AV THE O CLAR
237,BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME COLOR,BECASE IS HA THE SAME COLOR
238,TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,TURNING TO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
239,UM THE LIGHT LITTLE REFLECTS OFF THE LIGHT,IT WAS E ONLY E WEN E YABO E TATO LE AN EVITEOFIOUS ELEMENT SOMETHING OUT O THERANGDRAKT OF TO BROUD
240,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF
241,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF IN ECAGESINT COLOR
242,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SOLARBELS AND OM CIRCUS SAN THAT THEY DI OP
243,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FORCE WAS THE STRONG ENOUGH
244,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,WAT A DOESN'T A MIXD OPERS A WEEKR
245,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TO MAGNETS
246,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,IT GOWS BIGGER THAN THAN IT GROWS SMALLER
247,THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A,A OSAC TIN LIKE A
248,BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK,LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
249,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE
250,THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER,THE MAGNET AND THE PIBICUP CANNOT REPEL EACH OTHER
251,IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET,IT CAN'T BECAS O THETHE MAGNEATEM FOR
252,THE LIGHT BULBS ALL OF THEIR ELECTRICITY AND,LIGHTBULBS ARE ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY AS
253,BUT I NOTICE IS SOME IMPORTANT THERE ARE WIRES CONNECT,WOULD I NOTICE THES JUMSON CERTAIN PARTS THER AR LIVES CONNECT
254,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING ADD OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE ELECTRICITIES FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SI
255,WITH THE AT THE SAME WIRE AND YOU,IF I TAS BECAUSE I PUT A WOR BECAUSE IT'S BOTH AT THE SAME WAY AND YOU WALK PO
256,THE COMPONENT NEED TO BE RIGHT,THE CAFERN  MATE BE HOL FAR
257,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY IF BATTERY GIVING IT IT'S,ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE BATTERY GIVING IT ITS ENERGY TO PUSH ERIT THR
258,WHERE IS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE D CELL WIRES,WHERE THE ELECTRICITY MOST  RELIGIOUS O IS FRO THE WAT BELOW WIRES
259,BATTERIES ARE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW THAT IS GOT,BETTERS ARE ALL ABOUT CIRKETS AN NOW BETTER'S GOT
260,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE,I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE OM
261,WHEN YOU PUT THE D CELL INSTEAD OF GOING TO,WHEN YOU FLIP THE DSO INSTEAD OF GOING TO PA
262,ON THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH,ALL THE ENERGY IS GOING THR
263,WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT,WE LEARNED ABOUT A ROP IS AR GETING EAM COS ER GET AFFECTED AND INO WAIT
264,WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS IN,WHAT THAT RELATES HIS RICHES E AN
265,THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE,THAT IS ALL ABOUT ISER AMEGNEGATIVE FORCE
266,IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S LIKE A SAND,ITS ALL THOU SACA SANB
267,WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SO THE ENERGY IT GOES,WY HAPPEND  EASTER SO THOU HER ENERGY IGAS
268,THE LIGHT IT ON THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE,SO WAY ANE TO PUT TEMTHING ON THE LIGHT REFLEXT OF THE CASHBE
269,IT'LL EVENTUALLY HIT THE STAR RIGHT HERE,AL EVENTUALLY HIT THEN STAR REGIERS
270,IT BOUNCES OFF IT REFLECTS TO ANOTHER THING,I BOUNCES OFF HAM REFLECTS TRO ANOTHER THING
271,THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT BULB,THE LIGHT OF THE LIBAL OM CONTERD TO A HUMAN EYE
272,THEY BOUNCE OFF IT REFLECT TO OTHER STUFF,THEY BANKD OFF AND REFLECTED A TO OTHER STUFF
273,THE PENCIL IS IN A CUP OF WATER,A BANXO IS ANO CUK ON WATER
274,REFLECTIONS BY IF WE PUT MAGNET UNDER IT THEN,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THOUH SHE'S TRYING TO FIND HER WAY AGAINST THE NORTH OR SOUTH
275,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IS SECOND PART OF IT,I THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A CERTAIN PART OF I
276,THE FORCE AND MAGNETISM IS NOT GOOD STICK TOGETHER,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM IS NOT GOING TO LET IT STICK TOGETHER
