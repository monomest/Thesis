3895,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F N,THEND  AY HES I  TS OU T  IND
3896,YEAH,
3897,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS,WE OUD THE WE EOL OTHRWENWY THE  LS
3898,A RULER YEAH,FRTH HA
3899,Y LIKE THIS,MIE HI
3900,YES YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY,EATHEATTH OR  T L
3901,YEAH,
3902,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING,SOU THEND WE WAER LU THOUETHING
3903,BECAUSE I WAS OUR S THE STRAWS ON OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE'S SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT,E ECIS SAR  PRAAR S THE STTOUSTHATARER T MER SMAE THEN OLL THE OTHER SLT HAD THI FRD MEARMENS FORERI
3904,YEAH,
3905,WE LEARNED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM CAN,TETERT ATHE TEKIEI SOUM N
3906,IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THE,IT'S BAOUMAETHE ITHEH
3907,YEAH,A
3908,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL,LIAE THAS AN T HANDIT MAECSE E THING
3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,N HYD SHEN T
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SOU THEN LIE IF WE SEN SEN SSEOM CNRES TOUNNO ER AOROLTHERATHEN TH  T IDTAN THEN THE OUDTST AR AOR OWINGA THEA S HE THAT MON NO TLAER SEMTIE AEAIASHE MEATHECHEI STHO 'THEO ESNM HECR TCSHEICT OM TOCON THACWITHE THE ACN TRE

3918,BECAUSE THE METER TAPE HAS ONE HUNDRED DECAMETERS,E CHAS THE MTER TYO HAS WON NWI TNCOTHWRS
3919,YEAH YEAH,YA R TI HAS
3920,YEAH,HA
3921,UH YOU N IT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG OR HOW WIDE OR HOW TALL IT IS,H OIT'SHAOU O O OUL ONGE O TTYO HAO TAITI
3922,IT WAS ALL,ITH WEASEN
3923,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME ANSWER,THEN WAOL OTHE SND
3924,IT WAS A PAPERY AND LONG,THLTH IS FRAND
3925,WE DIDN'T GET A THREE OR A FOUR OR,E TDNT THT A TETER RI
3926,THEY'RE LITTLE LINES,TH WNTHEOWLTI
3927,BEC SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHERE THE DECAMETER WAS AND THE CENTIMETER,Y  S U THEN WE N TOLWA THAI THA OMTRLAIS N E SEN O TW
3928,NO,'TA
3929,OH THERE'S TEN IN ONE DECAMETER,O THER STHAND ND HE WEND TH ONTH
3930,THEN WE GOT M WE DIDN'T GET A WHOLE NUMBER,THEN E TWE YDNGTHTO OLNOR
3931,THEY WERE CUT UNEQUALLY,THE WOR AT N  L
3932,THAT'S THAT'S TEN CENTIMETERS,THATT'STHATT'STN SEN OMTH R
3933,THAT MEANS IT'S,THA MS I
3934,YEAH,HA
3935,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS INTO ONES THAT WERE EQUAL,EOTHEN WEY SWISTHOUTH S FOCES IN TO WAN S THAWR
3936,YEAH,
3937,THAT THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN IT,TTHAD THERSTHN SENAOHER ST IOITN
3938,ONE FIFTH OF A,N SHA HOTHE
3939,BECAUSE THERE'S AN EMPTY IN FRONT OF AN E T IN FRONT OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THEN AN M E T IN FRONT OF THE METER,E HACUSTHERAIS EN CMT IN FNECINMET IN FRNTE ATHR CSHE TO N AN  AN ANMT IN FRN THETR
3940,TO MEASURE OUR DESKS WITH,THO MMA HYORER THE E
