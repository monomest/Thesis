0,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING CAUSE WE DID IT ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO F TWENTY TWO,AND THEN WE TRIED TO THEN ALSO AFTER THAT WE THE WHOLE CLASS WAS SORT OF CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DID T ABOUT TEN TIMES AND THEN THEN WE DID WE SHE THE NEXT DAY SHE CUT THEM INTO LITTLE AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN SO AND THEN SHE HAD THIS LIKE NUMBER LINE IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY TWO
1,OKAY,OKAY
2,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS THAT MUCH THIS YEAR,UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE GRAPHS  THAT MUCH THIS YEAR
3,SO LIKE EH THERE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPER CLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY TO EVERYONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG IT ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH,SO LIKE THEYRE WERE JUST CIRCLES AND THEN PAPERCLIPS AND SO THEN WE WOULD TRY I TO EVERY ONE WOULD START AT THEIR DESK OR AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY'RE DOING AND SWING IT AND HOW MANY SWINGS THEY GOT THEY WOULD HANG AN ON THAT NUMBER YEAH YEAH
4,YEAH,YEAH
5,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS,UM PROBABLY TO RECORD YOUR ANSWERS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WANT NO JUST SAY OH THAT'S IT I KNOW THAT AND THEN JUST FORGET IT LIKE THE NEXT DAY SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECORD THE ANSWERS
6,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS CA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO,WE ADDED TWO PENNIES AND THEN I THINK THE WHOLE CLASS WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER I'M NOT SURE I DON'T REMEMBER AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF MOVED ON TO THE UH LENGTH OF THE STRING SO
7,UM PROBABLY THE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKED THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID V I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TOO SO WE S THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID,UM PROTLY HE EXPERIMENT PART WHERE WE WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE BEST WHERE WE WOULD START IT AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO DID I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT WE ADDED MORE PENNIES TO IT TO SO WE S SAW  THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT DID
8,YEAH A LITTLE,YEAH A LITTLE
9,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO DID THE NUMBER LINE AND THEN THERE WAS HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A T CHART AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE WROTE ON ONE SIDE IT WAS UM LENGTH AND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE R FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UH TEN INCH TEN CENTIMETERS I GUESS MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THEIR LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE,SO LIKE FIRST WE HAD SO ITO THE NUMBER LINE AND THEND THERE AS HOURS ONTO LINES ACROSS AND THEN WE HAD A TEACHER AND WE SO UM IT FIRST WE STARTED FROM THE BIG NO THE SMALLEST AND WE ROT ON ONE TIME IT WAS UM SLENGTH AN THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS SWINGS SO LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY DID LIKE UA TEN INCH  TEN CENTIMETERS LI GUES MAYBE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY AND THEN LIKE THEY WOULD PUT A NUMBER AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLEST THEY WOULD PUT THERE LENGTH AND THEN THEY WOULD PUT THE NUMBER THERE
10,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF CONVINCED US THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS IT GOT SO,SO THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A HUGE DOWN AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEN CAUSE THE HUGE DOWN I GUESS SOMEBODY  JUST FORGOT OR LIKE DIDN'T COUNT AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AGAIN THE NEX STAY CAUSE AND SO AFTER WE TRIED IT AGAIN IT SORT OF COMVINSED DUFK THAT THE SHORTER IT WAS THE MORE SWINGS IT GOT THE LESS THE BIGGER IT WAS THE LESS SWINGS TIT GOT SO
11,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD EM UM LIKE EXACTLY THE WAY OUR DESKS WERE OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD EM AND THEN UM THEN IT WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESSED ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE GOT TWELVE SO IN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER,AND SO LIKE WE FIRST TRIED TO JUST HOLD THEM UM LIKE EXACTLY WE THE WEIGH OUR DESK WHERE IT OUR DESK ENDS WE WOULD HOLD THEM AND THEN UM THEN I WE GUESSED HOW MANY WE COULD DO AN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I GUESS ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SO THEN WE TRIED IT AND LIKE MOSTLY  EVERY ONE GOT TWELVE SO AN WITH THE UM I THINK IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS WE DID AT THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ONE AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT GOT TWELVE AND THEN WE TRIED TO SEE IF GOING UP OR DOWN WOULD HELP IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
12,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TU YESTERDAY,UM YEAH WE JUST DID GRAPHING TO YESTERDAY
13,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY,UM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY
14,MATH,MAH
15,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE,IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE
16,OKAY,OKAY
17,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO L N ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE M THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE,WE GOT IT SORT OF GOT BIGGER LIKE IT WOULD LIKE THE NUMBERS SO  YOU ACTUALLY IT GOT SMALLER THE NUMBERS STARTED OUT BIGGER AND THEN S IT GOT SMALLER ND SMALLER AND THEN LIKE I THINK THE THE LEAST SWINGS WAS FIVE
18,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED,UM YEAH PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYONE REALLY HAD TO START WHERE THE DESK ENDED
19,OKAY,OKAY
20,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UM F LIKE UH THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE FORCE IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,WELL YEAH AT FIRST WE TR WE TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD AFFECT IT AND LIKE THE THREE THINGS WE DID WAS UM LENGTH UM UP  STARTING POINT AND THEN UM UH LIKE THE FORCE SO THEY WOULD FORCE IT AND SO WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE FORCE YET BUT I THINK THE FORCE IS FORCE IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
21,YEAH,YEAH
22,OKAY,KAY
23,NO,NO
24,SO MY SISTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I EXPLAINED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE EM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY AND YOU ATTACH THE S STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I TH I I DIDN'T TELL HER THIS BUT THEN YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULUM AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE STR THE PENDULUM S SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER SO,SO MY SYSTER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS S I EXPLANED TO HER AND SO UM AND SO I TOLD HER THAT A PENDULUM WAS LIKE A SWINGING OBJECT AND HOW YOU MAKE UM IS WE GET A STRING AND THEN YOU PUT A PAPERCLIP IN A PENNY AND YOU WOULD TACH THE STRING TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN THE PENNY TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU CAN SWING IT AND STUFF AND THEN UM THE I I I DIDN'T TELLER THIS BUT THE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT SHORTER TO HAVE THE MOST SWINGS AND THEN THE PENDULUM THE STRING OF THE PENDULA AND THEN UM TO MAKE THE ST THE PENDULUMS SWING LESS SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PEN THE PENDULUM STRING LONGER
25,OKAY YES WE'VE DONE PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE THE F LIKE WE WERE TESTING EM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG EM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE WOULD HOLD EM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YES WE SD D IN PENDULUMS SO LIKE UM WE'VE BEEN SOMETIMES WE WE WERE LIKE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM WE WERE USING LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE TH LIKE WE WERE TESTING UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS TO SEE SO LIKE WE WOULD HANG IM ON A PENCIL ON THE END OF OUR DESK AND WE OULD HOLD THEM AND SO AND THEN WE WOULD SEE HOW MANY SWINGS WE COULD GET IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
26,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE S IF WE STARTED ABOVE OUR DESK OR TH BEL B UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO E IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SOME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TO EXPERIMENT IT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINCED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING,SO WE WERE WE WERE THEN WE TRIED TO DO IT LIKE IF WE STARTED ABUVE OUR DESK OR ULBE UM BELOW OUR DESKS IF IT WOULD WORK ANY BETTER AND SO  IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING LIKE SME LIKE WE KEPT HAVING TE EXPERIMENT AT UNTIL EVERYONE LIKE WAS WAS CONVINSED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
27,OKAY,OKAY
28,WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET,WE HAVEN'TDONE NOT YET
29,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISED IS PROBABLY THAT W WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS,YEAH THE THE THING THAT MADE ME THE MOST SURPRISZES PROBABLY THAT WHERE YOU STARTED IT IT DIDN'T REALLY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SWINGS OR HOW MANY THERE WAS
30,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN S BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE,YEAH LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ALEVEN SOME PEOPLE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BUT USUALLY THEY GOT TWELVE
31,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESS,I JUST WANTED TO HELP OUT I GUESST
32,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH,LIKE A SWING IS GOING BACK AND FORTH SO LIKE IT STARTS HERE IT GOES BACK AND THEN COMES BACK THAT'S ONE SWING YEAH
33,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLEW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THE STICK WAS AND THEN FLEW UP TO THE WHAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WHA HOW HIGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARK A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING IT AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO IT WENT UP INSTEAD OF DOWN,WE UM WE WE WE SAW WE LIKE WE WALKED BEFORE WE FLUW SO UM WE WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO WHAT NUMBER THOF STICK WADS AND THEN FLUW UP TO THE WAT NUMBER IT WENT TO WE HOW HOGH IT WENT AND THEN WE WOULD MARKED A LITTLE DOT RIGHT THERE AND WE KEPT DOING THAT AND THEN WE FINISHED DOING AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WENT LIKE THIS LIKE THAT SORT OF SO WE WENT UP INSTEAD UP DOWN
34,UM WE,UM WE
35,WE WERE USING,WE WERE USING
36,BECAUSE THEN IT WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF,BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SORT OF RECORD WITH THE SAME THING THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT'S BECAUSE SH WE TESTED WITH THE A DIFFERENT THING AND STUFF
37,UH YEAH IF WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP,UH YEAH F WE DID THE TEST WITH THAT GROUP
38,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WERE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LAUNCHER THING AND THEN THE UN F LIKE YEAH IT'S THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK,WELL WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS THE VARIABLES UM WE'RE HOW FAR OR UM HOW NOT FAR YOU PUSH DOWN THE UM THE LONCHER THING AND THEN THE UM LIKE YEADIDS THE LITTLE FLIP STICK AND THEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN AND THEN IT GOES AND THEN UM ALSO HOW FAR IN YOU PUT THE FLIP STICK
39,YEAH,YEAH
40,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WHA WELL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT,UM TO GRAPH IT SO YOU KNOW WELL WILL SO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
41,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM UH S UM MMM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIERS AND THEN FLIPPERS,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UM EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF LIKE PENDULUMS BOATS UM US UM WHAT ELSE WE DID UM FLIRES AND THEN FLIPPERS
42,YEAH,YEAH
43,YOU THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CL WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MISS MOJO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE D,THEN WHEN WE WHEN THE CP WHEN WE SHOWED THE CLASS HOW TO DO IT SO THAT'S MAYBE WHY MIS MODOR DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE THING
44,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW A HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,PROBABLY WHAT WE FOUND OUT WITH THE STICK HOW AHOW IT ACTUALLY WENT FARTHER WITH THE STICK OUT BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
45,UM JUST A REGULAR BALL BUT OH WAIT BUT N BUT THEN MISS MOJO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY,UM JUST A REGULAR BULL BU ALL WEI BUT  BUT THEN IS MODO WE USED A DIFFERENT THING WE USED LIKE A CORK THING A CORK THING SO MAYBE THAT WHY
46,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT,THEY'RE UM UM THEY'RE A KIND OF THING THAT YOU DO THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT
47,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK,YEAH IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THING TO USE THEN THAT WOULD WORK
48,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EX UH AN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY D NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND STUFF,VARIABLES ARE SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME ON OF OF AN EXPERIMENT AND YOU THE EXAN EXPERIMENT IS THAT YOU YOU TEST SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU TRY DO NEW THINGS AND THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN STUFF
49,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH,UM WE WITH THE RESULTS WE RECORDED THEM ON A GRAPH
50,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP,AND IT LOOKED LIKE THAT IT WENT UP
51,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS,NOW WE JUST FINISHED DOING THE FLIPPERS
52,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WHAT WE SHOWED TO THE WHOLE CLASS,WE WOULD USE WHAT SHE USED WE WET WE SHOWED TO THE HOLE CLASS
53,MMM HMM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TEST IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE SHE PUT MARKS ON THE STICK THAT SAYS LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE,MM HM YEAH AND THEN AF WELL THEN WE TESTED IT WE DID LIKE WE HAD THESE STREM PUT MARKS ON THE STICXK THAT SAID LIKE SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TO ONE AND WE WENT ALL THE WAY FROM SIX TO ALL THE WAY TO TWO AND WHEN WE
54,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWO ONE OF THE TWO,WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S MORE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TWOO ONE OF TH TWO
55,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT,I'M NOT SURE CAUSE WE TESTED AND WE GOT OUR ANSWER AND STUFF BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT
56,W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING SHEET BEFORE BECAUSE WE MADE A RECORDING SHEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFORE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET'S SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX S ALL THE WAY IN THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIME WE GOT UH FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFTH TIME AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHA WE ADDED ALL THOSE T TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATOR AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH,WELL THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RECORTING SET BE FOR CAUSE WE MADE AT RECORTING SEET AND WE TESTED IT FOUR TIMES BEFOURE WE GOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER SO UM THE FIRST TIME LIKE LET SAY THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SIX ALL THE WAY AND THE STICK WAS ALL THE WAY IN WITH SIX THE FIRST TIME WE GOT TWO HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND THEN THE SECOND TIME WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THEN THE THIRD TIMES WE GOT UH FOUR HUUNDRED AND THEN THE FIFT TIMES AND THEN WE THAT'S WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE WE DID THAT WHAT WE ADDED ALL THOSE TIC TOGETHER ON THE CALCULATER AND THEN DIVIDED IT BY FOUR AND THAT WAS OUR RESULT AND YEAH
57,WE ALL CAME UP WITH BAR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLASS DID AND THEN AFTER THAT WE SORT OF W THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHOOSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH ONE THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDED UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM OR HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS,WEL WE ALL CAME UP WITH BIGR VARIABLES ALMOST THE WHOLE CLAS TIN AND THEN AVF TOER THAT WE SORT OF  THE WHOLE CLASS GOT TO CHSE LIKE SHE WOULD PICK ON PEOPLE AND THEN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND THEY GOT TO PICK THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY WOULD PICK WHICH WHEN THEY WANTED TO DO AND WE ENDID UP DOING HOW FAR OR HOW UM HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS
58,WE PUT ON THE X AXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE X AXIS IS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER WHERE THEY MEET AND WE WALKED LET'S SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR SIX AND SO I WENT TO SIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WHA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW M FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO SIX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT,WE PUT ON THE XAXIS AND THEN WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO HOW FAR THE STICK WAS IN AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS WELL THE Y AXIS IS RIGHT HERE THE XES  SIS RIGHT HERE SO WE STARTED AT THE CORNER THE WHERE THEY MEAT AND WE WALKED AND WET SAY I WENT TO HOW FAR STICXS AND SO I WENT TO STIX AND THEN ON THE Y AXIS THERE WAS UM WEA AND THEN THERE WAS LIKE HOW LONG THE HOW MU FAR THE STICK WENT UP SO WE WENT TO STICX AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO HOW FAR IT WENT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE DOT
59,OUR GRAPHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STILL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE WAS AN X AXIS AND A Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT,OUR GRAPH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED STEEL BUT UM WE IT WAS THERE AS AN X AXIS IN THE Y AXIS THE X AXIS IS WHAT WE KNOW AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS WHITCH WE WANTED TO FIND OUT OR WHAT WE FOUND OUT
60,UH HUH THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNEW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN A AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HIGH IT WENT,THAT WAS UM THAT WAS HOW FAR IN THE STICK WAS CAUSE WE KNOW HOW FAR WE PUT THE STICK IN AND THEN THE Y AXIS WAS HOW HY IT WENT
61,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TEST WE USE A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMINUM BALL AND THE NEXT TEST WE USE LIKE A BEAD OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL OF THAT,BECAUSE WELL IF ONE TES WE USED A CORK AND THEN THE NEXT TEST WE USE AN ALUMIN BALL AN THE NEXT TEST WE USED LIKE A BEAT OR SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEIGH THEM SAME THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME THEY DON'T UM THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALL THAT
62,MMM HMM AND THEN WELL SO SINCE SIX IS ALL THE WAY IN WE TESTED SIX FIRST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL TWO SO SIX IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MISS MOJO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND UM SHE CHOSE TWO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVIS ANOTHER BOY IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THE STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LOW AND THEN TRAVIS TRIED AND HE PUSHED THE STICK ALL THE WAY IN TO SIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE,M HM AND THEN WELL SO SEND STICX TUS ALL THE WAY AND WE TESTED STICXKS FORST AND THEN WE WENT WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTILL TO SO STICXS IT ACTUALLY WENT UM MIS MO JO MY TEACHER DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS AND WE DIDN'T EITHER BUT IT ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER THE FARTHER OUT IT WENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE TESTED RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY WERD BCAUSE WE TRIED WE WHEN WE FIRST WERE GETTING INTO IT WE UM WE GOT THE STICK AND M SHE CHOSE TO PEOPLE TO TRY IT ME AND TRAVES ANOTHER BLLE IN THE CLASS AND THEN SO UM I TRIED THO STICK FAR OUT AND I FLIPED IT UP AND IT WENT LOW AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT STILL WENT LO AND THEN TRD THIST TRIED AND YOU PUSHE THE STICK ALL THE WAY INTO STIX AND IT WENT REALLY HIGH AND THEN WE GOT THE OPPOSITE
63,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE EXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO,NO NOBODY ELSE DID THE SEXPERIMENT ONLY TWO EXPERIMENTS TWO GROUPS DID AND OUR EXPERIMENT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SO
64,THAT WAS FURTHER IN,THAT WAS FURTHER IN
65,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IT WASN'T ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPEL THE POWER FRE THROUGH I GUESS,UM IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH S UM IF IT WAS IN ENOUGH SPINS WITH THE PROPELLER JUST FOR THE PROPELLER TOPOWERT FR T THROGH GAS
66,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT,WE MADE PLANES THAT LOOK LIKE THAT
67,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAVE MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REAL PLANE SO I BET THE HEAV THE MORE PASSENGERS THE HARDER IT'S GONNA GET THE MORE SCH THE MORE SPINS OH WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DID WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD T SCIENCE AND THEN P E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO,THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET IT WOULD GET HEAVIER SO IT HAD TO HAV MORE FORCE BECAUSE LIKE LIKE THE PASSENGERS WERE PAPER CLIPS JUST LIKE WE WERE PASSENGERS ON A BIG REEL PLANE SO I BEG THE HAVE THE MORE THE PASSENGERS THE HARDER T'S GOING TO GET THE MORES THE MORE SPINS UM WE NO WE ARE TESTING THE VARIABLES TODAY WE DIDN'T WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BECAUSE WE HAD TO SCIENCE AND THEN T E AND THEN SCIENCE AGAIN SO
68,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWO S WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET,YEAH AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE TRIED IT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK TWICE WE MADE TWO METERS WE MADE A HALFWAY MARK ON IT AND WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE COULD GET
69,WE JUST DISCUSSED WHAT NUMBER,WE JUST DUSK GAS THROUGH WHAT NUMBER AH
70,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO HA LIKE TO JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPUN IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OUR REAL EXPERIMENT AND SO WE PUT IT ON ONE END OF THE CHAIR AND ACTUALLY UM THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE I THE OTHER WAY IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW H THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO P E SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT THE THE NEXT DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TWO S SP,WELL YEAH AND THEN WE TRIED WE JUST TRIED TO H LIKE TO JUST PLL IE AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE AND SPON IT AND THEN WE GOT INTO DOING OR REAL EXPERIENCE WENT AND SO WE PUT IT OUT ONE INTO THE CHARE AND ACTUALLY ON THE CLOSEST END TO US CAUSE THE OTHER WAY ITWOULD GO BACKWARDS SO WE TWISTED IT UH SIXTY TIMES IT WENT AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND WE NEEDED TO KNOW HO THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND SO WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY AND THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO PE EAT SO WE COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE BUT THEN THE NEX DAY WE ONLY GOT FIFTY TWO SO WE DID IT IN FIFTY TO
71,WELL WE NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT WOULD BE COOL,WELL W KNOW EO REALLY DIDN' BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED ON TOP OF THE LOCKER AND THEN THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN SOND THAT WOULD BE COOL
72,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETE FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FOUR METERS,WHICH IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETER FOUR HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IS FORTY
73,YEP ACTC LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT WELL WE DID ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND THEN WE DECIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT A F LIKE MO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST DECIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND IT PRETTY MUCH WENT EXACTLY A LOT,YEAH ACTUL LIKE WE DID IT ABOUT ALL WE DID ABOUT FOURTY FIVE AND THEN WE JUST SIDED IT WAS TOO SHORT BECAUSE IT ONLY WENT AF LIKE MORE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY SO THEN WE JUST TSIDED TO TRY SIXTY AND WE TRIED SIXTY AND PRETTY MUCH WHEN EXACTLY A ON
74,YEAH,YEAH
75,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CROOKEDNESS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'RE S KEEPING FORTY SPINS WE'RE JUST TRYING THE FORTY SPINS LIKE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS,YEAH WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SLOPE E'RE NOT CHANGING THE COOKANIS WERE NOT CHANGING ANY PASSENGERS W'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PASSENGERS ON OH YEAH WE'R'S KEEPING FORTY SPINS  WE'RE JUST TRYING O FORTY SPINS LIKE THISN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY SPINS
76,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
77,YEAH,YEAH
78,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S A LIKE REALLY COOL TO SEE THEM FLY BUT I WANT THE SWINGERS BECAUSE THEY WE HAVE THIS VARIABLES BOOK AND IT SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS UM A WOMAN DOING UH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO SEE AND THIS WOMAN WAS DOING A FRONT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHE WAS DOING A VAULT AND I DO VAULT LIKE I TAKE GYMNASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THOUGH,THE PLANES CAUSE IT'S LIKE REALLY COOLD TO SEE THEM FLY BU I WANT THE SWINGERS BCAUSE E WE HAVE THIS VARIABLE BOOK AND ITS SHOW IT SHOWS HOW THE FORCE AND THE FORCE ONE FORCE WAS A WOOMAN DOING AH UH LIKE I PICKED A HEAD JUST TO THE SEE AND THIS OMAN WAS DOING A FERUENT HANDSPRING OFF THE IT WAS SHUY DOING A VALT AND I DO VAL LIKE I TAKE MASTICS I DID AND I I COULD DO THAT IT'S REALLY FUN THEN
79,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE OH YEAH FOUR METERS,LIKE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAINE IF YOU DON'T REALLY GO SO LIKE UH YEAH FOUR METERS
80,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FIN YEAH ONE TWO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE RAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY CH TESTED IT LIKE ONCE,THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SPINS IT TAKES A SPIN IS LIKE SO YOU GO AROUND AND THEN YOUR FINGER MEETS IT AGAIN AND AROUND AND YOUR FING YEAH ONE TO LIKE YEAH AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT WE GOT SIXTY BUT WE WRAN OUT OF TIME SO WE ONLY JTESTED IT LIKE ONCE
81,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHAIR WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR Y IT WAS ONE CHAIR WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROB IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP IT WOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU BROUGHT IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALL SO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHTNESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM CROOKEDNESS SO MAYBE THE CHAIRS WERE CROOKED,IF IT WAS THE SLOPE LIKE ONE CHARE WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER OR  IT WAS ONE CHEARE WAS ON TOP OF SOMETHING IT WOULD PROP IF YOU STARTED FROM THE TOP ITWOULD PROBABLY GO FASTER AND IF YOU PART IT FROM THE BOTTOM IT WOULD JUST FALLSO SO THAT WAS SLOPE UM ONE WAS UM WAIT SO I DID TIGHT NESS OF THE STRING SLOPE UM COOKID NESS SO MAT BE THE CHARES WERE COOKEIED

123,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S N E CAUSE MY K PARTNER WAS NATHAN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIS THIS WAS THE THREE CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER I'LL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THE PASSENGERS WE GOT WAS SEVENTY FI SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE IT'S RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLEW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN UP HERE YEAH SO THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UP HERE,AND THEN SO UM WE CALLED ONE OF OURS THE S S AEND E CAUSE MY PARTNER WAS MAITHIN SO AND THEN OUR CAPACITY WAS I THINK WELL THIS WAS THE WE CALLED THIT THIS WAS THE THIRTY CENTIMETER ONE SO OUR CAPACITY WE GOT WAS LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER ALL JUST LIKE MAKE ONE UP LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN THA PACENGERS WE GOT WITH SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN AND SO FIRST WE WALKED AND WE DID THE CAPACITY SO WE FOUND THIRTY FIVE SRIGHT HERE THIS IS THIRTY FIVE AND THEN WE FLOUW UP AND THEN WE WENT TO SEVENTEEN O E YES AND THEN LIKE IT WOULD BE UPPERE
124,YEAH,YEAH
125,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR BOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE A DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF BOATS LIKE I DID A FIVE S WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE DID UH WE FINISHED LIKE MEASURING OUR VOATS AND WE TRIED TO WE MADE DIFFERENT LENGTH OF BOATS LIKE I DID AFFIVE WE DID FIVE CENTIMETERS TWO CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
126,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY UM IT WAS JU THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW,THESE REPRESENT THE CAPACITY WHICH WCH UM THERE WAS JST THEY WERE JUST DOWN THERE I DON'T KNOW
127,UH OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'M THINKING TODAY SO THE SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEIR SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM IT THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IN THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EDGES ARE SO HIGH YOU CAN'T GET IN,O OKAY SO THEN MAYBE THE SMALLER BOATS THAT'S I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHEN I'M THININ TODAY SO TTHEY SMALLER BOATS PROBABLY HOLD LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THEY'RE SIDES ARE SMALLER AND UM THE WATER CAN GET INTO THE SIDES EASILY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORTER SO WHEN THEY GO DOWN LOWER IN THE WATER THE WATER CAN GET THROUGH MUCH MORE EASILY THEN WHEN THE BIG BOATS GET LOW IND THE WATER THE WATER SORT OF CAN JUST LIKE TRY TO GET IN BUT SINCE THE THINGS ARE SO HIGH THE EGES ARE SO HIGH IT CAN'T GET IN

142,AND THEN,AND THEN WHAT DID YOU PEA R
143,YEAH,YEAH
144,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WE STARTED MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM ACT WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN S SUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLIN CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT,AND THEN WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZES BOATS WE SORA MAKING LIKE FIVE CENTIMETERS THREE CENTIMETERS UM EUALLY WELL LIKE ACTUALLY TWO CENTIMETERS NOT THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN UM WE DID THAT BECAUSE UM WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD PUT IN EACH ONE LIKE WE SQUIRTED WATER FROM A SYRINGE INTO IT AND THEN SSUCKED IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND PUT IT INTO A GRADULATED SINA CYLINDER AND THEN WE MEASURED AND WE GOT A NUMBER AND THEN AFTER WE DID THAT
145,OH OH OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN AND LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO FE THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE ROUGH WATERS AND THEN YOU PUT IT IN CAUSE ROUGH WATERS DOESN'T END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL,OH O OKAY THAT OKAY I THOUT YOU ERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO UH WELL THE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE VARIABLES YOU MEAN LIKE THAT VARIABLES ARE THINGS THAT YOU CHANGE OR DO TO UM TO AFFECT THA AFFECTS THE OUTCOME SO WE MADE UP VARIABLES THAT THE WATER HAS TO BE STILL IT CAN'T BE LIKE RUFF WATERS AND HN YOU PUT IT IN BCAUSE RUFF WATER'S DON THE END UP GOOD WITH BOATS AT ALL
146,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING,UM WE WANTED JUST TO GO LIKE THAT NOT LIKE DROP IT UP IN GROUPS OR ANYTHING
147,YEAH,YEAH
148,AND THEN WE DID THIS IS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PROBA UH WE DID YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS,AND THEN WE DID THIS WAS OUR TWO CENTIMETER ONE THE CAPACITY WE GOT FOR THAT ONE WAS PF A UH WE DID IT YEAH IT WAS THE CAPACITY WE WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY MEASURE THIS I GUESS
149,YEAH,YEAH
150,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKED TO KELLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YE WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THE WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO,UM WE DID WE PUT NO NO NO BUT WHEN I TALKE TO ALLY WE DIDN'T DO OUR UH YES WE WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF WE D MADE OUR BOAT BUT WE NEVER PUT THAT WE DID SCIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY SO

153,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME,BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME
154,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL OF OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS T CHART ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE WROTE LIKE BOAT NUMBER ONE BOAT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOAT NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE WAS A HUGE RANGE OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIZE PASSENGERS,LIKE WE ALL MADE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS FIRST AND THEN WE TRIED ALL F OUR PASSENGERS AND WE MADE LIKE THIS TEACHER ON THE BOARD THE WHITE BOARD AND WE ROATE LIKE BOT NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO WE WERE BOATIN NUMBER THREE AND LIKE THERE IT WAS A HUGE WRAIN OF TWELVE TO TWENTY SIX PASSENGERS
155,YEAH,YEAH
156,UM YEAH,UM YEAH
157,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TO TRY TO HAVE THE E SAME OUR WHOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WA WA HOW WE COULD GET AN OUTCOME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUTCOME AND GET FI FIND AN UN A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T FOR TO THE PENNIES IN LIKE IT FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS,UM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANTED TOE TRYI TO HAVE THE SAM THE OR HOLE CLASS WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW W  HOW WE COULD GET AN OUT COME AGAIN LIKE THE SAME OUT COME AND GET FUN FIND N  A CONCLUSION BUT WE REALLY DOM FOR TO THE PENNIES AND LIKE FIT THE THREE CENTIMETER BOATS AND THEN THE OTHER BOATS
158,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH,YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH
159,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPPING TO THE BOTTOM AND WHEN I DROPPED THE PENNY IN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO,CAUSE WE WERE WHEN WE DID IT IT GOT LIKE THAT FAR AWAY FROM DROPD INTO THE BOTTOM WHEN I DROPD THE PENNY AND IT DROPED TO THE BOTTOM AND ONLY WHEN IT DROPED TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER CAME IN SO
160,YEAH,YEAH
161,YEAH IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HA F FIND WE WANNA HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EXPERIMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU WANNA KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO IT IN THE END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS IN EACH ONE THEN OUR OUR THE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE A L UM ALL IN ALL PR UM MO UH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLDS TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES,YEAH I BECAUSE IT DOE YOU WANT TO H FIND WEU WANTNO HAVE A EXPLINATION FOR YOUR EXPERIENMMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EN LIKE THE OUTCOME AND SO LIKE SO WHEN YOU WOULD DO ALL OF IT THEN AFTER WARDS YOU WANT NO KNOW THE OUTCOME SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MAKE A FINAL CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO COME TO AN TH END LIKE LIKE IF ALMOST ALL OF OUR BOATS HAD TWELVE PASSENGERS AND EACH ONE THEN ORE ARE THERE OUR FINAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE ALL THE UM ALL IND ALL UM MOT AUH A THREE CENTIMETER BOAT USUALLY HOLVE TWELVE CENTI TWELVE PENNIES
162,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS SHE'S OVER THERE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE MO LESS NO MMM LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS HOLD LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IN I FORGET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE REASON WAS BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABOVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LOW THE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPS TO THE BOTTOM,SO YESTERDAY I TOLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER NABES STS OFOR THE YEAH UM I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOATS WOULD HOLD LE M LESS NO LESS PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS WOULD HOLD MORE PENNIES BUT TODAY I THINK THAT BIGGER BOATS HOLD MORE PENNIES AND SMALLER BOATS LOTLED LESS PENNIES BECAUSE WE TRIED OUR FIVE CENTIMETER BOAT AND WE PUT PENNIES KEPT DROPPING PENNIES IND I FOR GET HOW MANY PENNIES WE GOT LIKE THERE WAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT I THINK PENNIES AND UM THE RESU WASE BECAUSE OUR BOAT LIKE GOT REALLY LOW IN THE WATER LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MUCH ABUVE AND IT DIDN'T SINK BECAUSE THE WATER JUST COULDN'T GET IN ALL THE WAY UP SO BUT IN THE SMALLER BOATS WHEN THEY GET THAT LO WITHE WATER JUST GOES IN AND THEN IT DROPPS TO THE BOTTOM
163,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
164,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE SATURATED SOLUTION SOMETHING LIKE THAT NO THE START OVER,IT TOOK SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS TO LIFT UP THE THE CETRID SALI SOMETHING LIKE NO THE STONR HO

1164,IS TEN,JUST TEN
1165,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFECT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS,SO THAT THEY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A PERFICT MEASUREMENT OF ALWAYS
1166,TEN OR MAYBE MORE YEAH,KINDAR MAYBE WARN'K YOU
1167,MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT,MSUREMENT OF WHAT WATER OR WHAT
1168,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES,WHEN YOU INCREASE THE MORE BATTERIES LIKE LIKE THEY'R LIKE WHEN IT WRAPPED AROUND HUNDRED VINTS IT PICKED UP THEIR DWASHES CAUSE IT AD TWO BATTERE
1169,WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A,WUH MEN IT 'ILLCREASE MORE THE LIGNES IT HAS MORE THAIRES U FORE
1170,UM REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,REPEAT THAT AGAIN
1171,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED,WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY ANDENERGYGETS FORCED
1172,WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T,WHEN IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT UM UM ITIT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TIRCUIT IT DOESNT
1173,WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE,WHEN I MINUSD THE LINE TO SEVEN IT ME T TEN ONS I WOULDN'T N IT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
1174,WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT,WHAT IS JUST SCAVERS WHEN I PUT MTHE WR WRAPPING A MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM A MORM A WASHERS STICK TO IT
1175,UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY,UM IT'S ATTACHED TO THIRTY
1176,WELL WHEN I PUT A HUNDRED UM IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP PICKED UP SOME WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN WASHERS SO IT ADDED UP FIVE MORE,WELL WHEN IT PUT A HUNDRED WIMS IT PICKED UP FIFTEEN WASHERS PP BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UPIT PICKED UP TUM WASHERS INSTEAD OF FIYSTEEN WASHERS SO  AT AND UP OR FIVE MORE
1177,WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET,THE WIRE'S WRAPPED AROUND A A RIVET
1178,UM IN CASE WHEN I DO THAT IT PICKS UP TO LOWER CAUSE WHEN I PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT LEAST WAIT UH WHEN I PUT IT TO A HUNDRED WINDS AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WASH,M IN INCREASED SONE I DO THAT DIT PICKS UP TO THE LOWER CAUSE YOU HEN IT PUT IT UP TO THIRTY IT PICKED UP AT THE SREIGHT A WEN  BUT IT TROGH A HUNDRED WNS T AT LEAST PICKED UP THIRTY WAS
1179,WHAT IT RELATES IS,WHAT IT RELATESS
1180,UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING,UH WHAT'S IMPART HIN IS THERE'S A ASPALES TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS A E IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED IRC TO EVERYTHING
1181,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO,THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE OVERSE ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES THE GOES UP TO
1182,WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET,YOU'LL ACOMPLISH THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET
1183,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE,WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANNANO MAKE YOUR ELECTRO MAGNTET TARS IDD MORE BATTERIES FASCING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
1184,THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT,THEY MARE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
1185,WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS,BUT A STAND A OT OF MEDLA GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS
1186,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY,WAT HAPPENED TO AM BE OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BAT
1187,AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,UM IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A BASIENWATER AND INKEASING WATER
1188,WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT,WHAT I DISSCAVERED IS THE ELECTRICITY  NOW FLOWING UPTHROH AND A LIGHT BULB FA MUSHIN TE REFRIT
1189,NO,I USED THAT
1190,IT IS AN ELECTRICITY IS THIS RUN THROUGH BECAUSE AND THIS WAS THE CHANGE AROUND AND IT HAS TO WILL STOP TO HAVE ANOTHER NEGAVITE AND POSTIVE POSTIVE SIDE TOUCHING EACH OTHER NOT A DIRECT TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,IT IS IN ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING THROUGH BECAUSE ANY SY TURNS AROUND ANDATHERS HAVE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE AND THE POSITVTIVE ASTSI  TOUCHINS EACH OTHER AND ALTHER'S O WAT MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
1191,UM IT WILL <unk> IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT,UM IT'LL IT'LL THE LIGHT BULB ION S BRIGHT AND BREIIT ERTH TO LIKE TO THE LIGHT AND ABURN IT OUT
1192,IT WILL BECOMES UM IF WE JUST HAVE ONE THIS ELECTRICITY NOW AND THIS INTENSIVE DIFFERENT PARTS <unk> RIGHT,DIFFER BECAUSE TO JUST HAVE ONE THE ELECTRICITY WILL RUN OUT AND THERE'S SERTIN FKINES OF DIFFERENT BULE THAAN INSIDE IT STRINS OF LIGHT
1193,GOING ON HERE THAT MAKE SURE IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHERE WHEN DEVICE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE AND FACING WIRE,IT'S GOING ON HERE THAT MAKES IS THE CIRCUIT IS UM WHET WHEN THE WISE ARE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TO THE CESING WHERE AND THE BASING WATER
1194,THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU,BOTH WIRES VEACTISM THE REPEAT THENT AGAN
1195,I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,I THINK THEY'L BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1196,OH WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY WITH THE LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LITTLE BE DOWN AND ROCK SEPARATE IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT A MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SAME BLIGHTER,WELL WHAT I OBSERVED IS WHEN YOU ADD JUST PUT ONE BATTERY AND PUT TWO LIGHT BULBS IT'LL FLTA BE DELL AND AEON'T SHIBABRIGHT BUT IF YOU ADD TWO BATTERIES IT'LL ONLY TWO LIGHT BULBS SHIME BRIGHTER
1197,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS WHERE THE BATTERY THERE LIGHT BULB,IT SHOWS ME THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE HETHE LIGHT BULB
1198,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH,IT'S IMPARTERNT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICIT GOES THROUGH
1199,AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT,A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
1200,THERE IS A THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY,THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONCE A PATHWAY
1201,BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS,WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCES LIRNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
1202,I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPEN IS IT WILL SHOW NO WAY AND NO WAY NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH BATTERY PUT THAT,I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS  IT WILL SHIGHT LOWER AND LOWER NOT LIKE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT LIKE IF YOU CONNECT THE BATTERY WITH THE BATTERYOU PUT THE
1203,OKAY,GREAT
1204,THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT <unk>,IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT WI THE LIGHT BULB LIT
1205,FINISH,PINNATION
1206,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,ANARY PEATIR THE
1207,IT'S NOT CONNECT,WIT CONECTOU R   WCHA T TO MPETR
1208,I THINK GO I HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT HAS BOTH OF WIRES HAS TO BE ON A FAING WIRE AND CASING WIRE,I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND E WHAT BOTH THEF FWIRES HAVS TO BE ON A BASING VARE AND UN OCASING WIRE
1209,WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER,WHEN WE ADD MORBULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WIKER
1210,SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE,ALSO IT THE LIGHT IS CLEAR BECAUSE OF PAR THEM
1211,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO,BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO
1212,IT IT TURNS INTO THE,IT IT TURNS INTO THE FOO
1213,COLORS,COLORED SISY
1214,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED,IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAS RED R PASD TO BE RED
1215,UM CHANGING COLOR,UM UM IT'S CHANGING COLOR
1216,UM IT WILL TURN DARK,UM IT WILL TURN DOURK
1217,CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS,LECTHRANGED THE SOLS THE FILTER
1218,UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE,UM IT'S NI USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT'S IS GREEN LIRME AND IT'S JUST FIGGREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
1219,IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS,ITSH IN THE PRISM IS CHANGING IT COLORS
1220,BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR,I WOID LOH HOW THE REFLECTION OF E TRODAR ERAPS
1221,IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM,IT'S REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR TO A PERSON
1222,IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE,IT'S IN BECAUSE I'SPRAT REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
1223,FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE,THE LIGHT PUMP BASHING OFF OF OBJECTS THROUGH ATH THE COLOR BLUE
1224,SEVEN SIX,SEVEN T LOOKS
1225,BY HOW IT REFLECTS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE TO VIOLET TO PURPLE TO BLUE TO GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED,WEAT HOW IT REFLECS OFF TO MAKE THESE KIND OF COLORS LIKE H TO VIALATE TO PURP T POLLUTE TE GREEN TO YELLOW TO ORANGE TRED
1226,THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL,THE IGHT S REFLECTS IG DON'T PRAALY PLL
1227,THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR,THE REFLEXTRIIUS TO TO MIXING THE COLLOR
1228,TURNS INTO,TRANSI YELLLOWNG
1229,UM STRUCTURE OF A LIGHT,UPATHER WAS AND STRUCTIONOF HA LGHT
1230,A RED,INNN THE RED
1231,UM IT'S REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE OR THE,YEAH UM THAT'S REFLECTING OFF AS A BLUE OR AT THE LIK THEURE
1232,GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT,GIVES OFF UM C LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BEL AUS YOU CAN ONLY USE THE LIGHT
1233,BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME COLOR,BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME COLOR
1234,TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
1235,YES THE REFLECTION THE COLOR,YES THE REFLECTION AND THE COLOR
1236,UM THE LIGHT LITTLE REFLECTS OFF THE LIGHT,IT WAS DO UM WHEN  YEAAOF ER NUM HAND SOMETHING OUP OTF THEI'R WANSRAT O TO ET
1237,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF
1238,SIX COLOR,SI'S A
1239,THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR,THE COLOR IS REFLECT OFF IN THE CHANGES ITS COLOR
1240,SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN,SOLAR TULB EN UMCIRCUITS AND MXAY ISM
1241,WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS DARK GREEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH IT DOES THAT BUT WHEN THE CAR GETS WHITE IT DOESN'T IT TURNS BLUE,WHAT HAPPENS AS IT TURNS DARKGRN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MIX UP YELLOW WITH BLUE YEAH AND IT DOES THAT BULBEN THE CART IT'S WHITE IT DOESN'T PIC JURNS BLUE
1242,THEY ALL HAVE LIGHT,THEY'LL HAVE LIGHT
1243,ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS,UN  UM A ONE BACER TNINES UH AND NINE WASHERS THO BREAK ITS
1244,UM BY ITS FORCE,UM BY ITS FORCE
1245,THE FIRST WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH,THE FORCE WAS N'T THE STRONG ENOUGH
1246,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER,WHAT IT DOESS UH MIXED TO FIRST A WEAKER
1247,THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPER IT PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND,THE MAGNET IS N'T JUST PAPER BAT E THE PAPER CLIP IS OM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND
1248,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT,THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS PEAS URE ES PELSE TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS OOUTED TO CONNECT
1249,THE MAGNET <unk> THAT MAGENT IS UM IS UNDER THE STACK AND YOU ARE JUST MOVING THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP HAS NOW MAGNETISM CONNECTED TO IT,THE MAGNET THE MAGNET IS ON UM ITS ENDAT TIX STACK AND AND YOU'RE JUST MEAVED ING THE MAGNET AND THE MRAPCL CAUS O MAGNETS ISMT CONNECTEIT TO
1250,WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS,WHEN IT IS ENTERED WHEN WASHED IT IT BROK GETS FALL BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE IT 'S THE SPACERS
1251,SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER,THE FORCE UHM I THE SPACES MADE THEY FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
1252,WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN,WHAT I ABERBE HAPPENING IS LIKE GN TME PRESSING THE WASHERS GOIN
1253,IT IS WHEN YOU BARELY ADD ONE SPACERS IT BREAKS ITS FALL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM ISN'T REALLY THERE TO STICK ON,IT'S THE VANOUBAALLYT HAD OFONE SPACER IT BREAKS ITS FULL LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MAGNETETISM ISN'T REALLY JOOD TO STICK ON
1254,WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE MAG AH MAKES IT THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN,OR WHAT IT CELLS IT MAKES TE AH MATH THAT MAKES IT THE UAMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
1255,ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS,ON THE LOUFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
1256,WE PUT WASHERS IN ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGNETS IN ANOTHER CUP TO SEE THERE HOW MANY WASHERS WILL BREAK OR THE MAGNETS FALL,WE PUT WASHERS AND ONE CUP AND THEN WE PUT MAGMAGNETS AND AL THE OTHER CUPS TO SEE IT UM HOW MANY UM WASHERS THTBREAK OF THE MAGNETS FALL
1257,THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH,THAT'S ALL THE GOOD TO SEE IT THE MAGNETTISM OF THE WECTUALL IS FORSCE TONOGT
1258,WHEN THEY GET FURTHER APART THE FORCE GOES WEAKER BECAUSE THERE IS THE OTHER MAGNET'S MAGNETISM FORCE OF THE FORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES IT WEAKER,WHEN IT DIVE FIRTHER APPART THE FIRST C FOUR CLE  A WEAKER BECAUSE THEREI'S THE OTHER MAGNETS MAGNET TISM  FORCE OF THE WORCE IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT WHICH MAKES THET WEAKER
1259,THAT IT'S SPREADING APART,THERE'S SPREDDING APART
1260,AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE,AS I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP U TO HOW MAY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE TTHE SFALL
1261,MAGNETISM,MAGNECTISM
1262,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE FOR WHEN IT PRESS SPEACERS WHEN IT ADD THE THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNETS ARE STILL TOUCHING EACH OTHER
1263,IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER,BECAUSE BIGGER THAN HE IT ALES SMALLER
1264,WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE,WHAT IT DOES IT UM MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER W A WORKER IN STEATD OF BEING STRONGER AND USUALLY THE FORCEIT
1265,I NEEDED THREE,I NEEDED THREE
1266,I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP,I NOTICE IS WHEN IT'S  LESS THAN ONECS LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MAGNET COULD HOLD THE PAPER
1267,I THINK IT'S SERVING BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE FLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TAKE OFF THE MAGNET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL IN THEM UM I MEAN THAT KIND OF AH THAT KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEM SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY,I THINK IT'S EVERY BECAUSE IT'S LONGER AND IT HAS MORE FORCE BLOWING BUT BY ITSELF IF YOU TICK OFF THE MAGNET AND DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF METAL ON AUM I MEAN THAT KIND OF UMUHTHE KIND OF UM MAGNET IN THEMTHAT'S ALL I HAVE TO
1268,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAW THOSE ONES WHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL ON THE MAGNET AND STICK IT TO A PAPERCLIP IT WILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT FORCE OF IT,THAT IT'S LIKE I SAWL THIS VEEAONS SWHERE IF YOU LIKE RUB SOMETHING METAL RON THE MAGNET AND STICK INTO A PAPERCLIP IT'ILL STAY ON BECAUSE IT'RE THE FORCE OF IT

1276,WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE,WATOR I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S THE ANY TIME THEH MAGNETS ON IT ITT REACTS LIKE
1277,ACTING LIKE A MAGNET UM LIKE A WIRE YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH AND JUST MAKE IT STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND IT ACTS LIKE A METAL,ISN'T IT ACTING LIKE A MAGUM  LIKE A WIRE COULD WRAPP IT AROUND ELECTRICITY AND CURENT FLOWING THROUGH AND STILL MAKE ITS STICK TO ANYTHING LIKE A METAL AND REACTS LIKE A METAL
1278,WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP,WHEN IT'S TO MAGE IT WHEN IT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN IT S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPER CLP

1461,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND FOR HAPPENS IS RUNNING CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT HELP TO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT,BECAUSE WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON IT AND WAT HAPPENE INSPEGET TO H BATTERY IT HELPD IT DOES AND LIK T LIGHTLIGHT
1462,WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT BULBS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH HIM AND RELATED IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE LIKE,WHAT I OBSERVE ABOUT THE BULBS AND ITS THER ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THEM AND IT REALLEASES IT AND IT GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO THE LIGHT
1463,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TO ELECTRICITY HAS STOP GO BUT IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT ARE IS THE ROUND,WELL IN A SERIES CIRCUIT IT HAS TENELECTRICITY HAS ASTAFF GOES STAFF GOES BUT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FLOWES AROUND AND MIX ITE AN AND AND MACTI
1464,IN THE CASE THE IS FOR AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ABOUT THERE IS ONLY SPECIFY ONE,IN THE CASE THERE IS FOR AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT WELL THERE 'S ONLY SUPASED IT BE ONE
1465,WHAT'S GOING ON IT GONE OUT THE BATTERY THROUGH <unk> BUT STILL USING THE SAME THING BUT NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND BY THE,WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT'S GOING OUT THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BUT STILL USING THE SALLAR THING BUT THEY NEED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND ODTER TO LIGHT UP
1466,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN PLEASE
1467,BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY THE IS THE ENERGY IS TWO DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS,WHAT I NOTICED THAT THE TANG IS THE ENERGY OR DIFFEREN CNUCTION
1468,<unk> WHICH BEST ONE'S NOW YOU GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AMONG LIKE PARTICLES THESE NOW WASTE IN ENERGY,WELL WIT'S BESST ONE NOW I GUESS IS THE ONE WITH THE BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THERE'S NOT WEASTED AN ENERGY
1469,<unk> THE <unk> THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T STOP BECAUSE <unk> BECAUSE THE <unk> CONNECTED RIGHT,M THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOES NOT STOP BECAUSE THE WAY IT'S GOING ECAUSE S CONNECTED TRIGHT
1470,WHAT I OBSERVE THE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS <unk> THAT ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY <unk>AND GOING TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS <unk>,WHAT I OBSERVED THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CIRCUIT IS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND GOING TO BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
1471,BUT I NOTICE THAT ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THIS GO INTO THE BATTERY,WHAT I NOTICED S  ENERGY THAT'S FILLING YOUH AND THE BATTERY AN IT'S GOING INTO THE BATTERY
1472,<unk> THE THE BATTERY REALLY ELECTRICITY,THE END OF THE BATTERYY ELECTRICITY
1473,WHAT I THINK WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS UM IS A LIGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER,WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ADD MORE BATTERIES TO COUPLE OF LIGHT BULBS IT'L IGHT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
1474,I THINK THIS IS THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT

1476,<unk> THE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE <unk> THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHT A WENT DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO AND OTHER ONE,UM THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THEY LIGHTS UP IT BURNTS OUT AND YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT ANOTHER ONE
1477,IT IS FLOWING <unk> INTO THE POSSTIVE SIDE,IT IS RUNNING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
1478,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T NOT <unk> LIGHTING WERE AND WHAT NOW ITS LIGHTING SO BRIGHT <unk> BECAUSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE,WHAT I NOTICED IS THE LIGHT BULB IS IN HOT LIGHTING WELL WHEN WELL NOW IT'S LIGHTING SO BRIGHT ECAUSE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE
1479,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB WHEN BACK OUT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB BACK UP,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY IT'S GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT THROUGH TH LIGHT BARK A
1480,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS MORE UM CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE MORE,I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONNECTIONS TO IT AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE MORE
1481,THAT ONE REMEMBER DIRECTION,WAT AR REMEMBERITS AIT HAS TO BE A CARENT AND A DIRECTION

1892,UH MMM CAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO ONE AT A TIME MMM A CA AND UH EACH TABLE GROUP IS A DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KINDA COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY THAT,UH CAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNO DO WHE AT TIME N AT END UH EACHE TABLE GROUP IS AF DIFFERENT VARIABLE SO THAT KIND OF COVERS IT I GUESS WE COULD TRY
1893,WELL IF YOU LIKE DO IT I GUESS IF YOU KIND OF TODAY UH WE'RE GONNA DO IT OUTSIDE UM,WELL IF YOU LIKE DO IT I GUESS IF YOU KIND OF TODAY UM WO'RE GOINGNO DO IT OUTSIDE UM
1894,YEAH YEAH MMM HMM I KNOW,YEAH YEAH MM HMM I DN KNOW
1895,UM LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN,UM LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN
1896,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHAIRS AND DUCT TAPED EM AND OUR WE WINED UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RUBBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WAIT ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IS THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASS ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES,UM WE'VE BEEN UM GETTING FISH WELL WE'VE GOTTEN FISH LINE CHARES AND DECK TAPE DOEM AND ARE WE WIND UP THE PLANE WITH THE PROPELLERS AND A RABBER BAND IS BETWEEN THE PROPELLERS AND UM THE PROPELLER AND SO YOU WIND IT AND UM THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES WLIK ONE OF THE VARIABLES WE FOUND OUT IT S THE SLOPE THE FORCE THE MASS ON HOW FAST THE PLANE GOES
1897,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN WRITE IT DOWN,OH WELL WHEN WE GOT IT HALFWAY WE DID THE SAME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND WE HAD TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THEN WE DID THAT RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO WE COULDN'T JUST FIGURE OUT THE NUMBER AND THEN RIGHT IT DOWN
1898,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE UM LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO AT THE TOP OF THE POD AND THEN ARE GONNA GO DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHAIRS WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO TOO FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK IT'LL HAVE A A VERY WELL CHANCE OF GOING DOWN LIKE UM MAYBE LIKE IN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHAIR CAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE STRING IS AT,YEAH UM SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE FOR SLOPE UM SOME PEOPLE ARE GOIN GO AT THE TOP OF THE PON AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GO DOWN TO STUFFS AND THAT'S WHERE THE TWO CHARES WILL BE AND THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GO UP AND UM JUST BY IN MY APPINNIOUN I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'LL GO HROUGH FAR IF IT'S GOING UP BUT I THINK YIT'L HAVE A A VERYWELL CHANCE OF COME DOWN LIKE UM MAY BE LIKE AN ABOUT FIVE LIKE TURNS ON THE PROPELLER IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO THE OTHER CHARE CAUSE OF THE AND GOE T STRING IS THAT
1899,N MMM AS LONG IT'S AS LONG A IT'S THE STRING IS TIGHT AND THE PLANE IS ON MMM HMM,M M AS LONG A'S AS LONG AS I'S THE STRING IS TIGHT AND THE PLAT IS IDE
1900,WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE A TWENTY MAYBE LIKE IN TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP,WO'RE EXPECTING IT TO UM MAKE LIKE MAYBE AND TWENTY MAYBE A LIKE AND TWENTY SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER SINCE THE FAN IS HELPING IT PUSH MAYBE THAT'LL HELP
1901,BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP,BUT IT I ASKD   LIKE WHERE ITS SAID UP
1902,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,WELL UM THE SYST K KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD IS TISTE
1903,YEAH,YEAH
1904,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALFWAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINS DOES THE PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY,WELL UM BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT UM WHAT WAS HALF WAY FOR THE PLANE SO AND THEN WE DID THE UH HOW FAR IS THE HOW FAR DOES THE HOW MANY SPINZS IS THA PROPELLER GO FOR ALL THE WAY
1905,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND UM SOMETIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE STRETCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMASHING INTO THE OTHER CHAIR THE ROPE GOES DOWN TO LIKE,WELL SO FAR WE'VE TESTED LIKE I TOLD YOU LIKE HALFWAY AND ALL THE WAY AND DN SOMETIMES WE WENT WHEN WE STRTCH IT TOO FAR THE PLANE GOES LIKE SMATSHING INTO THE ATHER CHARE THE ROPE GOES DOWN AND LIKE CUT THE
1906,YEAH LIKE IT WON'T IT IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DOUBLE IT IF IT WAS LOOSER LIKE UM S WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR OUR PLANE ALL THE WAY ON FIFTY TWO LINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LOOSER WE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE,YEAH LIKE IT WOLN'T IT WAUD PROBABLY HAVE TO DUBBLE IT IF IT WAS LUSERLLIKE TO WE GOT WE HAD THE STRING VERY TIGHT WHEN WE GOT OUR I WREPLANED ALL THE WAY OUN FIFTY TWO WINES AND THE STRING WAS VERY TIGHT SO I GUESS IF IT WAS LUCER WE MIGHT 'V HAD TO SPIN WOARE
1907,SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE,SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE
1908,YEAH,YEH
1909,WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY THOUGH,WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY
1910,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN I MAD AVE MIS COUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MISS UP THE WHOLE IPEREN EET
1911,UH WELL UM WE WERE CHOOSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM MISS MOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MINI FANS AND WE WERE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER,UH WELL UM WE W'RE CHUSING ONE VARIABLE FOR EACH GROUP AND UM OUR GROUP IS DOING FORCE AND SO UM ISSMOJO BROUGHT IN LIKE MANY PANS AND WE'RE TESTING IF THE FAN WILL HELP IT GO ANY FASTER LIKE WITHOUT IT BEING SIXTY SPINS AROUND THE PROPELLER
1912,A SANDWICH,A SAMDWITCH
1913,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MY GROUP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY DID UM THREE WAIT THEY DID ONE CENTIMETER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WE'RE COMPARING THEM,WELL LIKE MY UM THE MIKE GERE WAR RIGHT AND FRUNT AND WE THEY DID UM THREE I THEY DID ONE SUNTY METER AS A BOAT AND THEN WE DID FIVE SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN T WE'RE COMPARING THE
1914,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE A GOOD VARIABLE WE DI A AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OUR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP L UH HUH AND FIVE INCHES UH AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS IN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH HUH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN IN THE ONE EH WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TOO SUCCESSFUL YEAH TINY,YES WE DID MORE OH THAT COULD BE  GOOD VARIABLE WE D AFTER WE DID THE THREE INCHES OR TEACHER SAID THAT WE CAN DO UM ONE INCH TWO INCH THREE INCH FIVE INCH UP TO FIVE AND MY PARTNER AND I DID FIVE INCH AND IT OF THE CUP UH HHM AND FIVE INCHES U AND THEN WE PUT MORE AND MORE PASSENGERS THIN SO A VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU WHEN THE HEIGHT IS UM WHEN YOUR HEIGHT IS LONGER I GUESS UH UH YOU GET MORE PASSENGERS IN AND THEN  THE ONE IT WE DID ONE INCH AND IT WASN'T TWO SIX SET FULL YEAH YEAH
1915,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON OURS JUST KEPT GOING TO LEANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORNER CORNER CORNER CORNER AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX IN THE FA FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM,YES CAUSE FOR ALL ALL THE OF THE HEIGHTS UM WE IT FOR SOME REASON AORE W JUST KEPT GOING TO LIANING TO THE SIDE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT FOR ALL THE HEIGHTS WE DID HAVE TO DO IT IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASSES LIKE CORN OR CORN OR CORN OR CORD AND THEN WE STARTED PUTTING ITIN THE MIDDLE AND THEN WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS IN THE THREE CENTIMETERS AND THEN WE GOT TWENTY SIX AND THE F FIVE INCHES OF THE CENTIMETERS AND UM
1916,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TITANIC YOU KNOW IN THE TITANIC THAT THE LIFEBOATS ARE HUGE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UH MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CRUISE CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY BIG CRUISE SHIP,IT WOULD SINK LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE TIBE TIN OU YOU NOW ON THE TINE TINIC THE THEIRE LIFE BOATS ARE HUDE THEY THEY CAN HOLD UHM MORE PASSENGERS MAYBE THAN A REGULAR CROUSEBOAT ECAUSE THAT WAS LIKE A REAL Y BIG CROU SHIP
1917,I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE,I'M KIND OF STILL WUNDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIE'S JUST TALL VSOLTE WE PE TRY TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THELET GO TO THE SIDE
1918,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE
1919,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
1920,I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING,IFEEL LIKE A SUPER STAR  FLIK ALREADY NEW THAT NI
1921,WELL IF JUST A FEW PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS OF LESS OF A CHANCE TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS LESS PENNIES AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL IN THAT CUP IN DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW,WELL IF JUST A FEWO PENNIES ARE ON THE SIDE IT STARTS TO GO TO THE SIDE AND THEN IT HAS LESS LESS OF A THRANS TO STAY UP WITH THE PASSENGERS FLASH PENNIES  AND SO UM WHEN THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY IN MASS AND THEY'RE ALL AND THAT CUP AIND DIFFERENT PARTS TO EQUAL IT OUT UM THAT'S BASICALLY HOW
1922,YEAH,NO
1923,UM WELL ARCHIMEDES I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTIONING UM HOW HE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WHAT THE MASS WHAT THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW IT WILL FLOAT OR HOW IT WILL SINK,UM WELL OAR CHMENIE'S I DON'T PARTICULARLY KNOW HIS NAME BUT WE'RE KIND OF UH QUESTING UM HOW WHE FIGURED OUT UM LIKE HOW BOATS FLOAT AND WHAT THE WEIGHT WITH THE MASS WHATH THE HEIGHT WHATEVER IS ON THE BOAT AND HOW LIGHT ILL FLOAW OR HOW IT WILL SINK
1924,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POUR THAT OUT IN OUR BIN IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WE GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE AND THEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY IS IN THREE AND THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE,UH HUH AND THEN WE HAD TO POURE THAT OUT AND OUR BIN TI'S NOT BIGGER THAN THAT BUT UM AND THEN WE HAD TO DO MORE AND THEN WE GOT IT UP TO HERE AND WI GOT LIKE FIFTY THREE BUT FOR THE FIVE WE GOT IT HERE ANDTHEN WE GOT FIFTY AGAIN AND THEN WE GOT THREE SO TWO FIFTY USE IN THREE THEN WE ADDED OUR TOTAL UP AND WE GOT ONE HUNDRED THAND THREE
1925,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT AND HOW I PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MADE THE LIFEBOAT WAS WE SET THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HIGH AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPIE WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER AND I S UH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL IT AT ONE SIDE IT WAS GONNA SINK EVEN FASTER SO,OKAY UM WELL WAIT SO HOW I MAD THE LIFE BOAT AND HOW WI PUT THE PENNIES IN SO WE GOT A HOW I MEED THE LIFE BOAT WAS WE TOUOKD THE COFFEE CUP OR CUP AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT HI AND WE TOOK A PEN SHARPLY WHATEVER AROUND THE CUP WITH A DICTIONARY AND STARTED TO TURN IT AND THEN WE CUT IT TO THE LINE WE DID AND THEN WE PUT IT IN OUR WATER AND THEN WE S PLACED THE PENNIES WHEREVER WE WANTED TO AND THEN OUR PARTNER INDI UMH THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT ALL AT UM ONE SIDE IT WAS GON TO SINK EVEN FASTER SO
1926,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT,UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOATED
1927,THE HEIGHT,THE HEIGHT
1928,MAYBE,MAYBE
1929,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD,WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFT CALPT BOAT CAN HOLD
1930,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE,WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE
1931,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS
1932,LIKE A CRUISE BOAT MAYBE LIKE LIFEBOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOR SOME REASON IF THERE'S A TER IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT OF GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIES THERE WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE A CAGILLION TIMES BIGGER SO,LIKE A CROU FILLT MAY BE LIKE LIFE BOATS LIKE UM LIKE IF THE FOIR SOMEREASON IF THERE'S A TE ABL IF LIKE THE BOAT CRASHES OR IF THE BOAT LIKE FOR SOME REASON RUNS OUT A GAS OR I DON'T KNOW BUT UM THE PEOPLE UH COULD INSTEAD OF THE PENNIYS THEY WOULD BE REAL PASSENGERS AND THEN THE BOAT WOULD BE LIKE I COULD YEALLY IN TIMES BIGGER SO
1933,YEAH,YEAH
1934,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE WELL WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP UP HERE FOR THE FIVE WE HAD TO PUT IT UP HERE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUY SORRY UM WHEN WE HAD THE SQUIRTER GUN E WE HAD TO SUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IT WAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE IS DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE AND SO WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE,YEAH THE FOR THE THREE UM WE HAD TO PUT THE WATER UP OP HERE FOR THE FIVE WAY TO PUT IT UP HEARE BUT WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARTER GUNE SORRY UMH WHEN WE HAD THE SQUARTER GOUN IT WE HAD TO STUCK UP ALL THAT WATER SO IWAS LIKE DOWN HERE AND OWN HERE AND THEN FOR THREE'S DOWN HERE I DOWN HERE AND SO WE STUCKED IT ALLF AND WE PUT IT IN A TEST TO
1935,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREE CENTIMETERS,THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN HER CUP THREE CENTIMETERS
1936,FIFTY S A HUNDRED AND THREE AND FIFTY SIX,FIFTY  A HUNDRED DEE A AND FIFTY SECZ
1937,AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY,AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY
1938,THAT LIKE THE,THAT LIKE THE
1939,ONE MORE TIME,THE MORE TY
1940,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THEN THE ONES THAT JUST TAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND
1941,IS THIS THING ON RIGHT,IT US BE MONENEY
1942,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,UH UM WELL I HINK THE DIFFERENCE ES THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YO WANT TO PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT IS BIG SARTA
1943,FIVE INCHES,FIVE INCHES
1944,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN PLAY
1945,I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER,I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER
1946,WELL E EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT,WELL AH EVERYBODY BASICALLY WAS WE WE COULDN'T DO LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE CUP SO UM EVERYBODY JUST DID THEIR OWN HEIGHT FOR ONE UP TO FIVE AND THEY COULD JUST CUT OFF HOW MANY INCHES THEY WANTED AND THEN YEAH SOME PEOPLE GOT
1947,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL I'M NOT WHAT I FOUND OUT IS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES,SO THIS ONE HOLDS MORE WATER SO I'M GUESS WELL  WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS IT ALSO HOLDS MORE PENNIES AS WELL AND THIS ONE HOLDS LESS WATER AND IT ALSO HOLDS LESS PENNIES
1948,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKS IT UP MMM HMM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBE TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK,WELL THE ONLY ONE WE DID THE MILLILITERS ON WAS THE THREE INCHES AND WE GOT LIKE THAT THE THING THAT SUCKED IT UP M HM AND THEN WE SUCKED IT ALL UP AND WE PUT IT IN A LIKE TEST TUBES TYPE OF THING UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND IF IT WAS OVER FIFTY WE HAD TO POUR IT OUT AND THEN JUST KEEP ON ADDING AND ON WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLILITERS FOR OUR FIVE INCH AND THEN ON OUR THREE WE ONLY GOT FIFTY SIX I THINK
1949,W WE MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED THAT MY PARTNER AND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRIED TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT AND IT STARTED TO TILT A LITTLE,W WE MY PARTNERAN I ALSO TRIED YEA MY PARTNERAND I ALSO TRIED TRYING TO PUT THE PENNIES IN BEFORE PLACING IT IN THE WATER SO WE KINDA DID LIKE MAYBE UM MAYBE LIKE SIXTEEN PENNIES PASSENGERS AND THEN WE PLACED IT IN THE WATER AND IT FLOATED SORT OF MORE AND SO THEN WE TRID TO PLACE IT IN THE BOAT WHAN IT STARTED IT TAILE A LITTLE
1950,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UH ONE TO FIVE INCHES THAT YOU CAN YOU HAD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP EM IN AND THEN ONCE IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANNER OF PASSENGERS AND,UM WELL IN CLASS WE HAVE LIKE TUPBS OF WATER AND LIKE COFFEE CUPS WATER CUPS DOESN'T MATTER BUT WE'RE DOING UM ONE TO FIVE INCHES IT YOU CAN YOU AD TO MAKE THREE AND THEN YOU SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN IT AND PASSENGERS ARE LITTLE TINY PENNIES AND YOU DROP AM IN AND THEN ONECS IT SINKS THAT'S THE MANER OF PASSENGERS AND
1951,WE THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT JUST TO EXPLAIN IT YOU KNOW NATIONAL TREASURE TWO Y WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BOARD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOUR MIND,WAIT  THIS IS KIND OF ETROPPIC BUT TOS STICK SPLIN IT YOU KNOW NATINAL TREASURE TOO WHEN THEY'RE HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEY'R UH WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT BORD THEY HAVE TO LEVEL OUT THEIR WEIGHT THAT'S WHAT ME AND MY PARTNER DID SO  YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOU MIND
1952,UH OF THE CUP OF THE COFFEE UH HUH AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUB OF WATER EACH UH PERSON GOT WITH YOUR PARTNER AND SO WE GOT A CUP OF PENNIES AND WE JUST INDIVIDUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIFE BOAT CUP AND UM SO THEN WE BASICALLY JUST DROPPED EM IN AND MY PARTNER'S KINDA WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINK THAT'S BECAUSE MORE OF THE MASS WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDE SO THAT IT WAS SINKING MORE SO IF WE WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY PENNIES IT WOULD EVEN IT OUT WELL IT DID AND THEN WE KEPT PUTTING MORE LIKE IN THE CENTER HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE KNEW THAT THAT LAST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS UM THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LIFEBOAT,U OF THE CUP OF THE CUP  UHH AND SO WE PUT IT IN THE WATER THE TUP OF WATER EACH THE PERSON GOT PITH YOUR PARTNER AND SO WE GOT A CUP OF PENNIES AND WE JUST INDEVIGUALLY STARTED TO DROP IN THE LIFE BOAT CUP AND UM SO THEN WE BAS ICALLY JUST DROPPED A MIN AND MY PARTNER IS INE KIND O WENT TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT AND WE THINKE THIS BECAUSE MORE OF THE MASS WAS GOING TOWARD THE SIDES SO IT WAS SINKING MORE SO IF WE WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE PUT MORE ON THE SIDE WITH THERE ORE THAN ANY PENNIES IT WOULD EVEN AT OUT WELL IT DID AND THEN WE KEPT PUTTING MORE LIKE IN THE SCENTER HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE AND THEN WE GOT ONE MORE AND THEN IT SUNK SO WE NEOW THAT THAT LASST PENNY WAS THE MATTER OF PASSENGERS UM THERE WAS SPOSED TO BE IN THE LIGHT BOAT H
1953,UM WELL W THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT AND THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE,UM WELL W THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT IN THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYMORE
1954,WELL UM WE W FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER WAIT NO EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST,WELL UM WE W FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY DID A THIRTY EIGHT CENTIM METER WE KNOW EVERYBODY DID THREE CENTIMETERS OF A CUP AND THEY CUT OFF THE REST
1955,WELL I THINK THIS ONE CAN HOLD MORE WATER,WELL I THINK THE SUNE CAN HOLD MORE WATER
1956,E I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO,I I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGT I HAD TO DO DOWN HEARE SO
1957,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE DECI WELL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PENDULUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTED UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND IT W AND WHAT WE UH FOUND OUT IS W NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP AS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,UM WELL WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM AND WE D SIDE WELL AND WHERE WE STARTED UM TO PUT THE PENDALUM AND SO WE STARTED AT DESK LEVEL AND THEN WE STARTEDT UP HERE AND WE DID IT AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVELS AND IT AND WHAT WE U FOUND OUT IS  NO MATTER WHERE YOU START THE POSITION OF YOUR PENDULUM IT IT ENDS UP HAS THE SAME MATTER OF SWINGS AND FIFTEEN SECONDS
1958,YES EVEN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE HUNDRED THE NINETY FIVE THE ME,YES EVEN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE HUNDRED THE NINETY FIVE THE MEAN
1959,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER,UM WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STRING CHANGES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO UM IT BUT THE MASS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU START THE PENDULUM DOES NOT MATTER
1960,YEAH,YEAH
1961,MMM HMM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER E WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLES STARTED TO CHANGE,MM WELL FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT UM EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME NUMBER WITH THE SAME MASS WITH THE SAME LENGTH BUT WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED TO CHANGE UH NUMBERS AND UM VARIABLE STARTED O CHANGE
1962,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YOU WOULLD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE
1963,WELL WE HUNG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOVE OUR WHITE BOARD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO GO BY ONE BY ONE UM WITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE,WELL WE HONG THEM UP ON A CHART ABOF OUR WHITE BORD AND UM WELL IT WAS LIKE UM IT WAS LIKE ONT TO THREE FOR FIVE ALL THE WAY THAT TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PEOPLE JUST TARTED TO GO ONE BY ONE UM WITH THE WITH THE PENDULUMS AND THEN MINE WAS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SO I PUT MINE LIKE RIGHT HERE
1964,ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAPH LIKE THIS,ALL THE WEY UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAPH LIKE THIS
1965,YEAH UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN M UH WE DECIDED TO USE ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO,YEAH UM EVERYBODY USED THIRTY EIGHT AND THEN UM WE DISIDED UH TO USE ONE OF OUR STRADITIES AS IF EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND SO UM YESTERDAY WE DID IT AGAIN AND I GOT UM THIRTEEN INCHES AND I GOT TWENTY TWO
1966,THIRTY EIGHT,THIRTY EIGHT
1967,YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET SEVENTEEN,YO WOULD PROBABLY GET SEVENTEEN
1968,YEAH,YEAH
1969,WELL W WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY EIGHT INCH UM PENDULUMS ON A STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY UH AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY ENDED UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIOUS OF TIMES,WE WE TESTED WITH UM THIRTY INCH UM PENDULUMS AN STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNIE UM AND EVERYBODY JUST DID IT AT THEIR OWN HEIGHT AND EVERYBODY UNDIDT UP WITH THE NUMBER OF TWELVE SWINGS FOR UM VARIES OFE TIMES
1970,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GIVEUS THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEME TO CHANGE
1971,CAN I HEAR MYS,KY HEAR ME
1972,AND THEN,AND THEN
1973,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DECIDING THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS,WELL UM WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT EVERYBODY IS DISSIDING WHITH THE WEIGHT UM AND THE THE WEIGHT AND THE WHERE YOU THE POSITION IS WHEN YOU START THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE LENGTH DEFINITELY MATTERS
1974,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TWO I THINK THREE FOUR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BOARD SO I DREW A LINE DOWN AND I DREW A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND UH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHART AND LIKE DOWN THERE,AND THEN THERE WAS ONE TO I THINK THREE FOR AND THEN I HUNG MINE LIKE I I SAW MINE UP ON THE BORD SO I JU A LINE DOWN AND I DROUG A CIRCLE AND THEN WE ALL JUST COMPARED OURS AND UH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD BE LIKE OFF THE CHAR AND LIKE DOWN THERE
1975,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU'VE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY SWINGS YOU GOT,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU HAVE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD RIGHT DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY SHINGS YOU GOT
1976,THE NUMBERS OF THE S YOUR YOUR SWINGS AND THEN THESE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF YOUR LENGTH,THE NUMBERS OF THE YOUR GUR SWINGS AND THEN THESE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF YOUR LENGTH

2483,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT AND YOU HAVE A BOWL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAY ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES,WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES AND YOU PUT IN YOU HAVE A BUL AND A SCREEN ON TOP THE WATER WILL GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG TO SO THEY WILL STAN ON THE TOP AND THIS IS HOW YOU SEPARATE SOME TYPES OF MIXTURES
2484,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAIL MIX ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS IT'S LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE AND IT,ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAL MIXS ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN PILE AND EACH PILE ONLY HAS ITS LIKE SHAPE AND TEXTURE IN
2485,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MUD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POUR IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WHILE THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED,WHEN YOU MIX TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER MOOD AND WATER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU POURE IT THROUGH THIS THE FILTER HAS AN VERY IMPORTANT ROL BECAUSE WHELL THE WATER DRAINS DOWN IT KEEPS ONE THING AT THE TOP AND THEN THEY ARE SEPARATED
2486,UM IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALTS UM THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER,IT BEGAN AS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER THE SALT THE SALT LIKE BECAME ONE WITH THE MIXTURE AND IT IS NOW DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
2487,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER,THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXE TOGETHER
2488,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BOWL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP,THE SCREEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHELL WATER CAN GO THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STAY IN THE BUL THE MARBLES ARE TOO BIG AND SO THEY STAY ON TOP
2489,IT IS CALLED WATER,IT IS CALLED WATER
2490,OH OKAY UH GOOD,GOOD
2491,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNIQUE PILE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR UNIQUE PILE INSTEAD OF IN ONE ALTOGETHER IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE,WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXTURE ARE SEPARATING INTO THEIR OWN UNICE PILE AND THIS IS IMPOT IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THEY'RE UNICE PILE INSTEAD OF E ONE ALL TOGETHER IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
2492,IT'S A SOLUTION,IT'S A SOLUTION
2493,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S UM IT'S PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING STAYS AT THE TOP THE WATER RUSHED DOWN AND IT STAYS AT THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND THAT AND YEAH,THIS IS CALLED A FILTER AND IT'S ITS PERPAS IS TO SEPARATE DIFFERENTKINDS OF MIXTURES WHILE ONE THING SEE THE JAT THE TOP THE WATER RUSH DOWN AND IT STAYS T THE BOTTOM IN THE CUP AND UM WHAT WE'V BEEN LEARNING SO FAR IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MIXTURES TO SEPARATE LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS STUFF AND TAH AND YEA

2920,JUST IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS ACTUALLY STAYING LIKE ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS A NOT REALLY AND KEEPS GOING OFF AND YOU HAVE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE BULB AND STUFF LIKE,IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE HTHAT ONE'S ACTUALLY STAYING LIT ON D CELL ONE AND THAT ONE IS LIKE NOT REALLY IT IT KEEPS GOING OFF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LIKE RELY DO THE LIGHT BULB AND STUFF LIKE
2921,AH WELL RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAD THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE,UHM WHE RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE HAS THE WIRES BOTH TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OR TOUCHING BOTH OF THE BOTH OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER WELL WHEN THEY POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S A WIRE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POSITIVE
2922,ONE D CELL AND IT'S NOT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO BUT THE TWO BATTERIES THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL,I ON ONE D CELL IT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE NOT GLOWING VERY GOOD AND ON D CELL TWO UM WUTH THE TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN D CELL

3652,THAT IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER IT STARTS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN IT STARTS GETTING ON THE WHOLE PENNY,THAT IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER IT STARTS IN THE MIDDLE AND THAT IT STARTS GETTING ON THE WHOLE PENNY
3653,CORRECT,ERRECT
3654,BECAUSE IT KEEPS GETTING IT'LL KEEP GETTING HIGHER AND IT'LL SPREAD IT OUT MORE,BECAUSE IT KEEPS GETTING THINK IT'LL KEEP GETTING HIGHER AND IT'LL SPET IT OUT MORE
3655,WELL ON THE SOAPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING AS HIGH IT'S STAYING FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENT OF SOAP IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF,WELL ON THE SOPY WATER IT'S YOU HAVE THE SAME SAME AMOUNT BUT IT'S NOT GOING IS HIGH STAME FLAT AND ON WATER SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INGREEDIENT OF SOPE IT JUST KEEPS DOING THE SAME STUFF

3843,BYE,BYE
3844,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS UM IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEET ABOUT THAT ASKING IF THERE IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME AND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME JUST SEE IF IT'LL AFFECT IT THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,UM THE VARIABLES ARE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT UM AND A CONTROLED EXPPERIMENT IS UM WELL IF YOU CHANGE THINGS MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WE JUST HAD A SHEAT ABOUT THAT ASKING OUF FY'S IC CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IF YOU S CAUSE YOU SH ANLY CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME MAND IF YOU CHANGE MORE THINGS AT A TIME TO SE F'LL AFFECT ED THAT'S NOT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
3845,UH LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTEEN OR ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURS IT WASN'T MUCH,UH LOOKS LIKE THEYRE TRYING TO FORGOT HOW MANY TIMES IT SWINGS IN FIFTYEN NER ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS IT LOOKS LIKE AND SO FAR JUST LIKE OURES IT WASN'T MUCH
3846,WELL WE HAD WE EVEN HAD A TWO HUNDRED,WELL WE HAH WE'VE HAD A TWO HUNDRED
3847,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT WELL RECORDING INFORMATION LIKE LET'S SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING A FORTY CENTIMETER STRING AND A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN ON THE GRAPH WE WE DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY PERHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE LIKE A TOWER ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION,UM A GRAPH IS ABOUT RIGHT WELL RECORDING YOUR INFORMATION LIKE LIT SAY WE HAD A THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING OF FORTY CENTIMETER STRING IN A FIFTY CENTIMETER STRING AND ON THE GRAPH WE WE DO THE THIRTY CENTIMETER STRING AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE STIX SEVEN ALL HEWAY UP TO TWENTY PRHAPS OR THIRTY AND THEN WE MAKE ACKE A TOWERE AL HE WAY UP TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THEN THEN WE'D HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION
3848,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE THIS WAS JUST A DEMONSTRATION SHE SHOWED US FOR PER PAPER AIRPLANES AND VARIABLES THAT ARE FO UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPERCLIP AND TAPE AND IT FLIES BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,UM YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME CAUSE EL THIS WAS JUST A DEMANSTRATION SH SHOWED US FOR PAR PAPER AIRPLANES IN VARIABLES AT A UM IF IT DOESN'T FLY WELL AND THEN YOU ADD A PAPER CLIP AND TAPE IT A FLIES BETTER YOU DODN'T KNOW WHAT'S MADE IT TO BETTER SO THAT'S WHY I SONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
3849,UM VARIABLE IS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD AFFECT IT,UM VARIABLE WAS LIKE THE THING YOU CAN CHANGE LIKE WE UM THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE MASS OF THE BOB AND WE ALSO AS A VARIABLE WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE IF IT COULD AFFECT IT
3850,M WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID LIKE IT UM SWUNG MORE MORE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING THEY USUALLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE,WELL WHEN WE UM TRIED THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER STRING DID LIKE INT UM SWUNG MORE MORE HAN FIFTEEN SECONDS SO UM AND THE LONGER STRINGS THEY TOOK LONGER TO SWING TMEYLY ONLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE
3851,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRINGS THEY'RE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT CONTROLLED,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY UM HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT STRINGS AN THEYRE EACH A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND THEY DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT ONE THING THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THAT' WHAT MAKES A CONTROLE
3852,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SIZED OF PAPERCLIPS BUT WE KEPT THE SAME SIZE OF PAPERCLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL UM WE KEPT LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZE PAPER CLIPS BUT WE KEPTD THE SAME SIZE OF PAPER CLIP THE WHOLE TIME AND UM WELL WE UM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BUT WE CHANGED THE WAY THE PENNY WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND YEAH THAT'S PRETY MUCH IT
3853,NO WELL THE PAPERCLIP SIZE WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE WHOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPERCLIP SIZE,UM WEL THE PAPER CLIP SIZED WE KEPT THAT THE SAME THE HOLE TIME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT WE CHANGED THE PENNIES LIKE THE WEIGHT AND WE CHANGED HE LENGTH OF THE STRINGS SO THE ONLY THING WE KEPT THE SAME WAS THE PAPER CLIP SIZE
3854,OKAY WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENDULUMS MOVE AND IF THE MASS OF THE BOB AFFECTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AFFECTS IT,OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE PENGULUMPS MOVE AND IF THE MASS TO THE BOB AFFECXTS IT OR IF THE LENGTH THE STRING AFFECTS IT
3855,UM THE WAY WE SHOWED THE RESULT IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT LIKE WELL WE HELD IT AND WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER,UM WHE WE SHOWED THE RESULTS IS OUR TEACHER TIMED US AND WE KEPT WE KEPT IT PLAING WELL WE HELED IT AND AN WHEN SHE SAID GO WE COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID AND SHE TIMED US AND SHE SAID STOP WHEN IT WAS FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK SO THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT OUR ANSWER
3856,M,
3857,UM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME,ULL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS I ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
3858,UM WELL THIS KIND OF CONNECTS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU CAN DO TO SHOWS ALL THE LIKE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT JUST LIKE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT THINGS OR LIKE THE SLOPE LIKE RIGHT HERE,SO THIS IS THIS KIND THIS IS EXACT LIKE OUR PLANE CEPT WE HAVEN'T CHAPE WE I THINK WE MIGHT CHANGE THE UM
3859,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE,IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE TO PEOPLE AREXPERIMENTING HOW FAR EACH ONE WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT ANGLE
3860,UM YOU,UM YOU
3861,WELL WE FIGURED OUT IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WAY BUT THIS CHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT TOOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT,WELL WE FIGRED OUT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET IT SEVENTY FIVE PORSCENT TOF THE WAY BUT THIS SHART IS WRONG CAUSE IT OOK US TWENTY FIVE SPINS TO GET SEVENTY FIVE POR CENT OF TWO METERS BUT THIS IS HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO METERS SO THIS GRAPH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S CORRECT
3862,UM THE RUBBER BAND LIKE IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGINE THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES GETS IT TO MOVE,UM THE RUBER BAND IT'S IT'S THE MAIN POWER LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT POWERS THE PROPELLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE ENGZION THAT'S JST WHAT MAKES SKGETS AT TO MOVE
3863,THE ANGLE OF THE STRING BUT YEAH,THANGLES STRING BUT YEAH
3864,FOUR METERS SORRY I MEAN IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS,FOR METERS SORRY I MAIT LOOKS T TH IUST WENT FOUR METERS AT FORTY FIVE WINDS
3865,UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ROBOT'S TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH,UM IT LOOKS LIKE IS ROBOTS TRYING TO SEE HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WILL GO AND WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS AND YEAH
3866,UM WELL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO JUST KINDA MAKE A COOL CONTRAPTION LIKE WE HAVE A PROPELLER THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISTED IT UP IT'S GONNA LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER POWER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY PUTTING PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH ARE THE PASSENGERS ARE PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH,UM WELL WE'RE JUST LERNING THE JUST GIN TOF MAKE A COOL CONTRACTION LIKE WE HAVE TO PROPELLER WITH THE RUBBER BAND WHEN WE TWISKED ITIT UP IT'S GIG TOF LIKE GO DOWN THE FISHING LINE BECAUSE UM YOEH THE PROPELLER POWER AND AND THEY WERGING TO TRY PUTTNG PASSENGERS ON TO SEE IF IT AFFECTS IT WHICH AR THE PASSENGERS OR PAPER CLIPS AND YEAH
3867,WELL SPINNING POWERS IT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER OF THE PLANE WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST KINDA SIT THERE,WELL SPINNING POWERS THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN POWER THE PLANE WITH WITHOUT IT NOTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN IT JUST I KIND TOF SIT THERE
3868,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS,POWER YOU COULD HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT THE STRENGTH OR LIKE WHAT MATERIALS YOU USE TO BUILD IT S THE CONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THINGS
3869,S SO,ES SO
3870,THE THE FIGHT THE FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UPWARD AND YEAH IT'LL LOOK WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TILTED UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH,THE THE FIGH FLIGHT LINE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP WORD AND YEAH LOOQUILL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FILLED IT UP JUST SLIGHTLY NOT MUCH BUT YEAH
3871,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR FOUR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH,UM THE SPINNING CAN LIKE POWER THE PLANE AND THIS E REALLY SEE HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MADE A PRETTY FAR FOR METERS WITH FORTY FIVE WINDS SO YEAH
3872,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER IN THIS CASE OURS IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISTS THE PROPELLER BUT UM WE ALSO NEED SOME WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE NEED LIKE CHAIRS SO THAT THE WIRE HOLDS LIKE STAY ON THE WIRE SO WE CAN TIE THE WIRE TO THE CHAIRS AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF HAVE PAPER UH TWO PAPER CLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWIST IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT,WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF POWER AND THIS CASE OURES IS A RUBBER BAND WHICH LIKE TWISKED THE PROPELLER BUT UM WYEUE ALSO NEED SOME TNG WE ALSO HAVE A STRAW THAT THE FISHING WIRES TO GO IN AND WE BE LIKE CHARES SO THAT THE WIRE WILL LTSH LIKE STAY ON SET THE WIRE QWIRE WE CAN TIYE THE WIRE TO THE CHARES AND UM YEAH AND THEN WE JUST KIND O HAVE PAPER UP TWO PAPERCLIPS IN THE BOTTOM WE PUT THE PROPELLER ON JUST TWISTED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
3873,HI,HI
3874,IT DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT AND ALSO DEPENDS WHAT VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S A YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT'S HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FAR THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE,ITDEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW FAR IT CAN GO OR HOW FAST REALLY DEPENDS BUT ANDIT ALSO DEPENDS ON'TH VARIABLE YOU CHANGE BUT THERE'S WHAT YOU CAN JUST HIDE BUT HOW HOW FAST YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW FARS OR L THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOUT CAN CHANGE
3875,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNS IT LOOKS HERE LIKE THIS GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR A US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TWO METERS BUT HERE IT ONLY SAYS ONLY TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO THAT'D BE INCORRECT AND UM YEAH,UM WELL OUR TEACHERS TOLD US THAT UM I'S ACTUALLY ALITTLE MORE TAN HALFWAY IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERSENT AND UM THIS WELL IT TURNED IT LOOKS HERE THAT THI GRAPH WOULDN'T BE CORRECT CAUSE IF SHE SAID IT TOOK TWENTY FIVE SPINS FOR US TO GO UM SEVENTY FIVE PERSENT OF TWO METERS BUT HE WED ONLY SAYS TWENTY TWO WINDS FOR TWO METERS SO TEHAD BE IN CORRECT AND UM YEAH
3876,W WELL WE HAVE A S WE HAVE THREE STRAWS ONE THAT GO ONE THAT GOES ON THE WIRE AND THEN IN HERE IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STAPLED ON EACH SIDE THEN WE JUST HAVE THIS S PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND THE PIECE THAT GOES ON THE BACK THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE,WELL WE HAVE A WE HAVE THREE STRAWS WEN THEY GO ONE THET GOES IN THE WAIR AND THEN UM HEUR IN THE PICTURE THERE'S THE TWO THAT GO DO DOWN THEN WE HAVE TWO PAPER CLIPS STABELED ON EACH SIDE ND THEN WE JUST HAVE THE SU PROPELLER PIECE A RUBBER BAND AND A PIECE TO GOES ON THE BAG THAT CONNECTS THE RUBBER BAND AND THEN YOU JUST MAKE THIS PLANE
3877,UM ONE THING THAT AFFECT IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIOUSLY AND ANOTHER THING THAT CAN AFFECT IT IS THE TYPE OF STRING IN OUR CASE WE'RE DOING FISHING WIRE BUT T IT COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING OR UH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINS AND THE TYPE OF STRING ARE ONE TWO OF THE MAIN THINGS,UM ONE THING THAW AFFECTED IS HOW MANY SPINS YOU DO OBVIUS LY AND ANOTHER THING THAT AFFECTED IS THE TYPE OF STRING ORKAITS WOULDN'T FISHING WIRE BUT YOU COULD DEPEND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU'RE USING THERE AH MANY THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT IT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF SPINGS IN THE TYPE OF STRING OR WNT TO THE MAIN THINGS
3878,WELL IF IT'S ANGLED DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ANGLED LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN CAUSE IT'S TRYING TO LIKE CLIMB A HILL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CL IF YOU'RE CLIMBING A HILL YOU GET MORE EXHAUSTED FROM GOING UP THE HILL THAN GOING DOWN IT,WELL ITSINGLE DOWN IT'LL GO FARTHER BUT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IT'S SINGLE LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT'S NOT GONG TO GET ANYWHERE AND IF YOU IF YOU AND IF IT'S JUST ASLIGHTLY ANGLED UP THAT'LL SLOW IT DOWN BCAUSE IT'S TRYING TO S LIKE CLIME A HEIL BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M CIF YOU'RE CLIMING T A HEIL YOU GAN MORE EXSOSTED FROM GOING UP THE HEIL TAND GOING DOWN IT
3879,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWN OURS BUT WE WANT TO GET OURS UP WE WANT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OURS MOVE WO A YARD AND A HALF,WELL WE ACTUALLY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FLOWING OURS BUT WE WANTNO GET OUR KYUP WE WANT BUT THE GOL AS TO MAKE OURS MOVE  A YEARD AND A HALF
3880,UM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ONLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND,UM WE NEED DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WINDS WE MAKE AND WE NEED TOAVE CHANGED IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK BUT ANLY ONE THING AT A TIME AND
3881,WELL THE THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY AS FAR CAUSE IT'S AIMED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE ON THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER,WELL THE THE BOTTOM ONE THAT'S NOT GONA FLY AS FAR BECAUSE IT'S AMPED UP SO IT HAS IT HAS TO USE MORE POWER TO GET UP AND THE ONE OT THE TOP WILL GO A LOT FARTHER
3882,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE FAKE AIRPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE,WE'VE BEEN MAKING LIKE BIGARPLANES THAT GO ON FISHING WIRE
3883,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USE FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S A LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU'LL YOU COULD CHANGE,WELL YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF STRING LIKE WE USED FISHING WIRE YOU COULD CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE RUBBER BAND LIKE THE LONGER THE MORE POWER YOU COULD CHANGE THE TYPE OF PROPELLER IF IT'S LONGER ONE OR SHORTER ONE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE BAT I THINK THE'SE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU ON' YOU OULD CHANGED
3884,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE,IT LOOKS LIKE THEYR MADE A PLANE JUST LIKE US AND UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP A BIT BUT NOT SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLANE
3885,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUST WENT FORTY FIVE,IT LOOKS LIKE IT JUSTSWIN FORTY FIVE
3886,BYE,BY AH
3887,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GO BUMPY AND THEN IT'LL LIKE AFFECT IT AND WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEED A WELL THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOOTH LINE IT CAN'T BE TOO FAR UH STEEP UP OR ELSE IT'LL UM THEN IT'LL THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YOU GIVE IT AND YEAH,ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT ITO GOES SMOOTHLY IT CAN'T LIKE GOATAL BUMPY AND A LITTLE LIKE AFFECTET AND WELL YOU YOU NEED A IT'S LEASE   WELLOW THAT'S YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE SMOTHE LINE IT CAN'T BE TWOO FAR A STEP UPPRLE ITL UM UW THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT UP EVEN KNO MATTER HOW MANY TWISTS YO GIVE IT AND YEAH
3888,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINDS OR SO JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS,WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER LIKE IF YOU WANT NO MAKE IT GO FARTHER WELL THEN YOU NEED A CHANGE THAT OBVIOUSLY AND YOU SEE LIKE CHANGE THE WINS OR SO IT'S JUST TO GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND SEE HOW DIFFEERENT IT IS
3889,WHAT,WHAT
3890,WELL YOU USE A ALL THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,WELL YOU USE A ELL THE TOOLES TO MAKE THE PLANE AND USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
3891,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING,A METRIC RULER OR SOMETHING
3892,YEAH YEAH THAT'S,YEAH YEAH THAT
3893,HI,HI
3894,THERE'S ONE HUNDRED,IS ONE HUNDRED
3895,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F N,THEN YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EQUAL F IN
3896,YEAH,YEAH
3897,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS,WE GOT THAT WE ALL GOT THREE WHEN WE GOT THE EQUAL STRAWS
3898,A RULER YEAH,HH A RULER YEAH
3899,Y LIKE THIS,E LIKE THIS
3900,YES YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY,YEH YEAH THEY WERE ALL CUT EQUALLY
3901,YEAH,YEAH
3902,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING,SO THEN WE DON'T ARGYOU ABOUT EVERYTHING
3903,BECAUSE I WAS OUR S THE STRAWS ON OUR TEAM WERE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE'S SO WE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT,BECAUSE OURE BS ARE S THE STRAW THAT ARE TEM ARE SMALLER THAN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLES SO WHE HAD DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS FOR IT
3904,YEAH,YEAH
3905,WE LEARNED THAT THE METRIC SYSTEM CAN,WE LEARNED THAT A METRIC SYSTEM CAN
3906,IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THE,IT'S ABOUT MEASUREING THE
3907,YEAH,YEAH
3908,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL,LIKE DESKS AND AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING EQUAL
3909,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS,ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
3910,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULERS THEN THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START ARGUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,SO THEN LIKE IF WE SAID SINCE SOME CUNTRIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT RULER IS THEN THEY S DIDN'T THEN THEY WOULD START AROUING WITH US THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A TOOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM SO T WEUS AND MEXTRICTIC SYSTEM TO CONTACT WITH THER CUNTRYES
3911,OH NO,I DON'T KNOW
3912,LET US KNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE IF WE'RE ONE METRIC ONE METER HIGH NO,LETT US NKNOW WHAT HOW TALL WE ARE LIKE GIVE FOR ONE ME TRIC ONE METER HI NO
3913,TEN,TEN
3914,WE USED A,WE USED A
3915,THEN YOU,THEN YOU
3916,STRAWS,STRAS
3917,UH WHEN IT'S STANDARD THAT MEANS IT'S ALL THE SAME WHICH MAKES IT WHICH MAKES YOUR WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING THE SAME WHEN IT WHEN IT'S EQUAL,THE WHEN IT STANDARD THAT MEANS IT SELL THE SAME WHATS MAKES IT WHICH MAKES HER WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING THE SAME WHEN ITS WHEN IT'S EQUAL
3918,BECAUSE THE METER TAPE HAS ONE HUNDRED DECAMETERS,BECAUSE THE METER TAPE HAS ONE HUNDRED DECMETERS
3919,YEAH YEAH,YEAH YEAH
3920,YEAH,YEAH
3921,UH YOU N IT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG OR HOW WIDE OR HOW TALL IT IS,UH YOUM IT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG OR HOW WIDE OR HOW TALL IT IS
3922,IT WAS ALL,IT WAS AL
3923,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME ANSWER,THEN WE ALL GOT THE SAME ANSWER
3924,IT WAS A PAPERY AND LONG,IT WAS U PAPER E AND LONG
3925,WE DIDN'T GET A THREE OR A FOUR OR,WE DIDN'T GET A THREA FOUR G
3926,THEY'RE LITTLE LINES,THE'RES EB LITTLE LIOME
3927,BEC SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHERE THE DECAMETER WAS AND THE CENTIMETER,WE CA SO THEN WE CAN TELL WHAT THA A DECIMETERILISE AND A CENTIMMETER
3928,NO,NO
3929,OH THERE'S TEN IN ONE DECAMETER,OH THERE'S TEN AND THE WEND DEC GOING EATER
3930,THEN WE GOT M WE DIDN'T GET A WHOLE NUMBER,THEN WE GOT  WE DIDN'T GET A HOLE NUMBER
3931,THEY WERE CUT UNEQUALLY,THEY WERE CUT UN EQUALLY
3932,THAT'S THAT'S TEN CENTIMETERS,THAT'S THAT'S TEN CENTIMETERS
3933,THAT MEANS IT'S,THAT MEANS IT'S
3934,YEAH,YEAH
3935,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS INTO ONES THAT WERE EQUAL,SO THEN WE SWITCHED OUT THE STRAWS AND TWO ONES THAT WERE EQUAL
3936,YEAH,YEAH
3937,THAT THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN IT,THAT THERE'S TEN CENTIMETERS IN IT
3938,ONE FIFTH OF A,ONE FIFTH OF THE
3939,BECAUSE THERE'S AN EMPTY IN FRONT OF AN E T IN FRONT OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THEN AN M E T IN FRONT OF THE METER,BECAUSE THERE'IS AN EMTY IN FRUND OF EMMY T IN FRUNT OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND IN N EMY T IN FERUND OF A METER

3942,NO,NO
3943,UH YOU CAN MEASURE,UH YOU CAN MEASURE
3944,YEAH WE MEASURED IT WITH A UNEQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR OUR FOR HOW HOW BIG OUR DESKS ARE,YEAH WE MEASURED IT WITH AN UN EQUAL STRAW SO SO WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS FER OUR FOR HEB HOW BIGG OUR DESKS ARE
3945,UM MEASUREMENTS UH THE METRIC SYSTEM,UH MEASUREMENT UH NHMETRIC SYSTEM
3946,YOU COULD TELL IF IT WAS FIVE OR,YOU COULD TELL IF IT WAS BY WERE
3947,YES,YEATH
3948,THAT MEANS THAT THE UNEQUAL LENGTH STRAWS WERE WEREN'T THE RIGHT SIZE BUT THE EQUAL STRAWS WERE THE RIGHT SIZE,THAT MEANS THAT THE UN EQUAL LENGTH STRAWS WERE LEARNT THE RIGHT SIZE BUT THE EQUAL STRAWS WERE THE RIGHT SIZE
