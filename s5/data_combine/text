02172-12706 THE TRICKS THAT HIS
02172-12707 GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
02172-12708 AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CA CAME THE MAYOR OF THE GREAT POND MISS
02172-12709 TORT POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE ON A TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
02172-12710 RULE NUMBER ONE
02172-12711 THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
02172-12712 RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
02172-12713 RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO
02172-12714 BE GOING FAST BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
02172-12715 ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY
02172-12716 CAN
02172-12717 ALL AT ALL TIMES
02172-12718 SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE
02172-12719 TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
02172-12720 RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP
02172-12721 SINCE IF
02172-12722 YOU ARE ASLEEP
02172-12723 YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
02172-12724 SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN
02172-12725 THOUGH HE KNEW
02172-12726 THEM BY HEART
02172-12727 THEN HE HEARD
02172-12728 THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING
02172-12729 LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
02172-12730 THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
02172-12731 THE WERE
02172-12732 ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
02172-12733 THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
02172-12734 AS THEY
02172-12735 DID THE SKY TURNED
02172-12736 FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
02172-12737 THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON
02172-12738 AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING
02172-12739 THERE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
02172-12740 ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW
02172-12741 SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE MOST SLOWEST AFTER A FEW HOURS
02172-12742 MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO SWISH AND MUD
02172-12743 WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
02172-12744 IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
02172-12745 THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE S SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARDLY TO TELL AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL
02172-12746 TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
02172-12747 BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD
02172-12748 BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
02172-12749 MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
02172-12750 WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
02172-12751 MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG
02172-12752 AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN I WAS
02172-12753 FASTER THAN YOU
02172-12754 WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING
02172-12755 YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
02172-12756 BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
02172-12757 YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT
02172-12758 I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
02172-12759 TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
02172-12760 THEN MUD TRIED
02172-12761 ANOTHER TRICK
02172-12762 HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL B
02172-12763 SWISH STARTED YAWNING
02172-12764 HE WAS TIRED
02172-12765 HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
02172-12766 THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF H THIS TRICK
02172-12767 HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
02172-12768 HE PUT THE EARPLUGS ON HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
02172-12769 THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED
02172-12770 THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
02172-12771 BUT THEN RIGHT AS THE END
02172-12772 BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET
02172-12773 SWISH
02172-12774 STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
02172-12775 OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
02172-12776 AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
02172-12777 SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT AL ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED
02172-12778 FOR SWISH THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH
02172-12779 A CLOSE RACE
