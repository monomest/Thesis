1276,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IS IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP STAYS AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IS IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIPS STAYES AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISMS
1277,UM WE'VE BEEN UH LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS,UM WE'VE BEEN U LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH H SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS
1278,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THERE IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPOSITE WAY SO THEY IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART
1279,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UH USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT 'EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE U USED FOR LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE U MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK
1280,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROSST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THEN SINCE THE MAGNETISM IS STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNETS IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
1281,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1282,WELL W WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN 'EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN 'EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT THE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WOR THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE,WELL WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN THEM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH I'L COMPART BUT IF YOU TURN HEM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT TH IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE
1283,WELL THEY'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT 'EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO LI IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO,WELL THE'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO BUT IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO
1284,AGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL,AGN IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL
1285,THERE'S A FORCE THAT PU THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS 'EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER,HERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT P THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS THEM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER IF SINCE THE'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER
1286,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET MEANS IT'LL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT' BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENTE MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET IT MEANS THAT IT WILL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES
1287,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOME THICK THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOME THING'S IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOMETHING THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOMETHINGS IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE
1288,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETI THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND IT'LL STAY ON THE NAIL,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETIC THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND TA ITWILL STAY ON THE NAIL
1289,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT N IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT IT'S ON IT AND THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCEI  ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THT THE NAIL IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT  IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT MAGNET IT'S ON IT AND THEN THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET

1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANYTHING
1553,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT
1554,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES  AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A
1555,THAT THREE WIRES ON SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE,THAT THE THREE WIRES ON ONE SIDE O SHAING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE BATTE
1556,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK
1557,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS

1560,GOOD,GOOD
1561,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH
1562,THEN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT'S NOT BURNT OUT,TAN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT S NOT BURNED OUT
1563,WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS,WHEN THE ILLAMET BREAKS A LOLO
1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,WE KNOW THAT SERIE S
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BECAUSE THO TWO LIGHT BULBS WARE SHARING ENERGY
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,THE FNIMENT IS' WORKING AND ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONE'S  YOU CN A RRIT FILAMENT THE BULB I DARKD B WATER WORKING
1567,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY C

1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT THE END
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN FLOW TO THE OTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,I S THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES
1574,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT M PROBEM
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,S CIRCUITS S CIRCUIT PAN ARE A BIG CIRCLE PLUCKNAND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LIN OF CIRCUITS

2120,THEY ARE FLYING IN A CIRCUIT AND THERE ARE ENERGY,THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
2121,NOTICED THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING INTO AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT,NOTICED THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING GANS CREATING A CIRCUIT
2122,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
2123,WIDER OR BEING VERY COMPLICATE,BRIGHTER OR BE EASIER TO COMPLICATE
2124,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DISCONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON I FORGOT YOUR QUESTIONS ANYWAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT,I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DIS CONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN'T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON BUT I FORGOT YOUR QUESTION ANYWAY SO I THINK I'M RIGHT
2125,OKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN A,OKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN
2126,BECAUSE THEY DO,I BECAUSE THEY DO
2127,OH NO AS WE,DON'T KNOW
2128,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
2129,KNEW,YOU
2130,YEAH THIS IS THE CAT CLOCK,IT IS THE CAT CLOCK
2131,THAT I DO NOT KNOW,THAT I DO NOT KNOW RIVER
2132,NO,NO
2133,CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,CIRCUITS AND L CIRCUITS
2134,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR PARALLEL CIRCUIT,I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2135,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN VERY RADICAL WAY,I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RADICALE WAY
2136,THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME,THEYARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
2137,IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE THE THUNDER YEAH YEAH EXACTLY THUNDER HA LIKE THAT LIKE YEAH,IT'S BECAUSE IT IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE ONDOR YEAH YEAH EXACTLY NOR IKE GRYEAH
2138,I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF,I THINK THAT THEM BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
2139,I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT,I NOTICED THAT IS IT THAT IT IS A CIRCUIT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
2140,THEY ARE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND BUT IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED FOR ME AND,THEY'RE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF ANDITSAN  MORE COMPLICATED FORM AND T ALA CYSTM
2141,NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD,NOTICE THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RAD
2142,IT IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND THE STUFF,JH IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH H ONE D CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND STUFF
2143,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
2144,WHAT,WHAT
2145,DON'T,DON'T
2146,THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
2147,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE GRAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAU BUT THE AMOUNT IT'S GOOD AT ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE S UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS,THIS FORMATION'S ALL ABOUT EARTH MATERIAL POTTING SOIL AND GRAVEL BUT THE GRAVEL IS MORE THAN THE POTTING SOIL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER THAN THE UH THAN THE RAV THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUS BUT THE MOUNT IT'S GOOD AND ABSORBING BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN' ABSORB THE WATER BECAUSE IT IT'S ALWAYS ON OUTSIDE AND PEOPL  UM STEP ON IT BUT THE POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS IT IN FOR THE PLANTS
2148,GOOD,GOOD
2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,ALL THE SOIL IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE O MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN IT GT LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVE JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,I'M KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUNDS AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOB
2151,WE BEEN,THE WERE DOING
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WIRK GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER UM GRAVEL
2153,I SEE WATER IN SOIL,I SEE WATER AND SOIL
2154,YEAH,YEAH
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF TER WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLAN
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SOL THE SOIL KEEPS E OTHER WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN NOT GROW IT CAN NOT GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP THE THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN FLOW SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,WELL THE SOIA UM ABSORB MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLI LITERS AND AND BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVE WILL LET FORTY WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IS CLOSED TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT AND  AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANTIT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT
2158,GOT WET,IT
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,PRETTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING  SODIO TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOEST IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WE GRAP GRAPL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,YEAH I JUST LIKE THAT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I OBSERVE THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE ITART AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATERS GOES DOWN TO THE CUP
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USED PUT POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR IT'S PLANT TO SAVE IT AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN  LIKE TAKES THE WATE OR IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,THE WAIY IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER CS STILL GO AWAY AND BECAUSE THE WATER T FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER UN THE SOIL YOU EC GL THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT WHOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE EENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERS ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOL A LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AN A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER
2168,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,WHEN I USED TABLES I I USED PLOTTING SOIL THEN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT STUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUST LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WILD DI
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,BECAUSE M SOMETIME THE HE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD A UM ABSORBING THE WATER T GROWS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNTS OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT
2171,BYE,BYE
2172,YEP YEP,YEP YEP
2173,WELL THE GRA THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOIL'S WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOIL'S KEEPING IT U ALL THE WATER BUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH IT DRIPS IT ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLES THAT CAN FIT THROUGH,WELL THE GRAL THE I MEAN THE SOIL S THE SOILS WATER DOESN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE THE SOILS KEEP ING ITU ALL THE WATERBUT SOME WATER GETS THROUGH DRIPS ON THE ROCKS THE GRAVEL IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S HOLDS THAT IF IT THROUGH
2174,WELL YOU CAN GO ON YOUR COMPUTER AN WELL YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GO IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM GE AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN USE THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOES MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT'D BE GREAT,WELL YOU CAN GO IN YOUR COPUTER N WELL YOU CAN'T GO NIN COMPUTE YOU COULD TAKE A RECORDER AND GO PLACES AND BRING STUFF TO YOUR HOUSE AND GOING YOUR ROOM AND THEN UM G AND THEN GO GET WATER AND USE BIG CUPS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH AND THEN OUSE TA MATERIAL AND THEN YOU COALD SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO AND IF IT GOS MORE THAN THE GRAVEL OR MORE THAN THE SOIL THAT W'L BE GREAT
2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER DRAINS WITH UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN  REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF A WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT
2176,WHEN YOU POUR ONTO THE EARTH MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOESN'T IT STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GO DOWN AND THE ROCKS ALL ROCKS CAN'T UM WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON 'EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,WHEN YOU POUR  ONTO THE EARTHS MATERIAL IT GOES THROUGH ON SOME MATERIALS IT DOES T  STICKS STAYS UP SOME DROPS GOE DOWN IN THE ROCKS ALL THE ROCKS CAN'T UM YOU POUR WATER ON EM THE IT GOES MUCH MORE FASTER BECAUSE IT HAS HOLDS
2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERES MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT IN THE SI MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUN THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE RAVEL MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL
2178,I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN,I THINK WHAT WA GOING ON THAT IT WAS GETTING DIRTY AND RETR CE IF IT GOT LIKE IF IT ABSORBED FROM DIRTY THEN CLEAN
2179,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER,YEAH IT JUST LIKE THAT BUT THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER REALLY HEAVY CAUSE IT TOOK THE WATER
2180,UHM IT WILL JUST JUST BE BLACK,IT WILL JUST  JUST BE BLACK
2181,UHM WELL UHM WHEN LIGHT IS SHINING LIGHT DOESN'T COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHITE,WELL WHEN LIGHT IS SINING LIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COME OUT COLOR IT COMES OUT WHIGHT
2182,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAINT ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE,WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT SHINES TO THE BLUE BALL AND IT COMES OUT BLUE LIGHT IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF BLUE FROM THE RAINBOW LETS IT COME THROUGH BUT THE BLUE COVERING BLUE PAIN ON THE BALL DOESN'T LET ANY OF THE OTHER COLORS SHINE THROUGH SO IT'S JUST BLUE SO IT'S JUST BLUE
2183,IT DOESN'T SHOW RED OVER THE BLUE BALL,IT DOESN'T STO RED OVER THE BLUE BLL
2184,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE,SO THE LIGHT REFLECTING ONTO THE BALL IS WHITE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS BLUE
2185,WELL I NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME WHITE LIGHT,WELL I NOTICED THAT THERE IS THEM WHITE LIGHT
2186,GOOD,GOOD
2187,SO WHEN THE WHITE UHM LIGHT SHINING ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,SO WHEN THE WHIGHTE  LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL THE YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2188,WELL UHM THE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL BECAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE OR BLACK IT JUST LOOKS BLACK,WELL MTHE LIGHT YEAH IS TURNING RED WHEN IT GOES TO THE RED PAPER AND IT'S COVERING THE WHITE PAPER SO IT LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL CAUSE THE RED AND BLUE BALL JUST THE BLUE BALL JUST LOOKS BLUE ORE BLACK JUST LOOKS BLACK
2189,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL'S NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE,WELL IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT IS ONE REFLECTING THE COLOR OF WHAT THE BALL COLOR IS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE THE YELLOW BALL ISN'T SHOWING BLUE LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING YELLOW AD THE BLUE BALL IS NOT SHOWING YELLOW LIGHT IT'S ONLY SHOWING BLUE
2190,BECAUSE THE GREEN LIGHT IS GREEN,CAUSE THE GREEN LINE IS AGRE
2191,THE LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY UHM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL THEY ARE YELLOW,THE LIGHT RAIS THATARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE AND WHEN THEY ARE ARE COMING OUT OF THE BALL IN THEI'RE YELLOW
2192,RED,RED
2193,UHM WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT,WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES ONTO THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT COMES OUT
2194,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLOR EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL,ALL THE COLORS TURN THE OTHER COLERXEPT FOR THE YELLOW BALL
2195,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE IT AROUND,ONLY THE RED COLOR CAN MAKE ITROWT
2196,WELL SHOWING FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB,WELL SHOWIN FROM THE PICTURE A SUN A CANDLE AND  LIGHT BULB
2197,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT UHM RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES THROUGH UHM IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK,THE LIGHT IS COMING OUT RED AND WHEN THE CAR COMES TRO IT JUST LOOKS RED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE BALL THE BLUE BALL DOES NOT LOOK
2198,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT
2199,YEAH THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER THE OTHER OBJECT WOULD TURN THAT COLOR TOO,YOU HAV THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT'S SHINING OUT OF THE FILTERED PAPER WOULD THE OTHER OBJECTS WHICH TURN THE COLOR TOO
2200,SO WHEN WHITE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLUE BALL UHM THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW IT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAME WITH THE BLUE SO ONLY YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BALL AND ONLY BLUE COMES THROUGH FOR THE BLUE BALL BLUE BALL,SO WHEN THE WHIGTE LIGHT HITS THE YELLOW BALL OR THE BLU BALL  THE OTHER COLOR OF THE RAIN BO CAN'T COME THROUGH EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR OF THE YELLOW WIT'S LIKE A BLOCKER AND SAY WITHTHE BLU SO THE YELLOW COMES THROUGH FOR THE YELLOW BELL AND HEN  BE COME FTE FOM THE BLUE BALLBLUE BOL
2201,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT UHM MIXED TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE UHM LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT AS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW,WHITE LIGHT IS REALLY THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BUT MIXD TOGETHER IT SHOWS WHITE SO WHEN THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM IT COMES OUT WITH THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
2202,COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH,THE COLOR WON'T SHINE THROUGH
2203,IT'S TURNING BLACK,IT'S TURNING BLACK
2204,SO UHM THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT,O THE YELLOW BALL IS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR YELLOW AND THE BLUE BALLS BLOCKING ALL THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBAL EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE LIGHT
