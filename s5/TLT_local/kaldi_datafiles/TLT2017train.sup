3070115_en_36_29_100	i think that @em doing sport is a great way @em to @em lose our energy and spread our power i think that every single sport from athletics to basket to volleyball is a great way to @m break @em our day and our homework and for example our study which @em @em @e help our mind to get out of @em our study @m i think that @m sport can be a great way to understand that we can every @em to achieve any @em any anything we want everything we want @breath and i also think that @em sometimes there is too much competition for example in judo or karate because there are @em simulated fights and sometimes @em there is too much competition because two people can @em start a mental fight in which they @em try to be better than one other and if this pe persons @em @e @breath if this person @em don't achieve their @em @breath what they want they can be depressed but i think that sport is important because we can @em get fit and so we can stay well with ourself and @breath @em we can also eat much more than before because we we aren't so fat and if we do sport we are @em @breath @e happier because 
3070117_en_35_28_100	i would like to live in a town because it's more @em interesting and you can go out and find all the shops and all do you want

3070117_en_35_28_105	i spend a lot of time in the internet in social- in social networks like instagram facebook or @breath snapchat and i find them useful breath because you can touch with friends and 
3070117_en_36_29_100	@breath i think sp- play s- sport is @e very important because @em @m you can find new friends and you can speak with them you can play with them and @em you can spend time for it and like @em you can not stay a lot of time in in internet and it's better for our healthy because we we can move and we are we can be funny and not stressfull it will @e take a lot of time but like @m you can play out every evening or at the weekend @em some matches and you can i i for example i play volleyball i play it three times a week and on saturdays or sometimes on sundays i have a match and we we go @em with our team in other cities like brescia or i don't know @laugh and it's always 
3070118_en_35_28_100	 so i would prefer to live in a village because i think it's better because it's from the town you like to stay in town and in a village you can be and there is the 
3070118_en_35_28_102	so my favourite book is <unk-it> is from an german writer and i really like it because it's an adventure book and it speaks about the his travel which which to 
3070118_en_35_28_104	so i would like to visit norway because it's in the north and i like the cold and then i think it is a really great country because i have seen a lot of photos and my and so i think it's it could be a great 
3070118_en_35_28_105	so i use i normally use a lot of internet like just to see films or to use social networks as instagram facebook and snapchat and not for other things yes for school but 
3070118_en_36_29_100	@breath so i think you to do sport because it's very important thing for your health and your life if you do sport you will be better and you can do any type of sport there are a lot of different sports like tennis volleyball golf a lot of sport also like you can go to the gym and just do exercise in gym and i think that you can you can just get healthier than and yea i think two year to do more sport and you can come with me and do some some sports you can play tennis i can play tennis you can train like the people you can try to play football but i'm not able to play or we can also play ping pong it's also a sport or i really like go biking so we can go i think together we can do a lot of things a lot of sports different sports also that i've never done so maybe we can do a lot of this 
3070120_en_35_28_100	@ns 
3070120_en_36_29_100	i think you should do sports because it's better for your life because you feel more healthy when you do sports and when you don't know what to do you can do sports it depends on which sport you prefer and @breath and i think it's for your routine your organisation becomes better because when you have less time you organise better when you don't have much time and you can you can you can organise better doing your your homework later or before doing the sports and and not only because the sports give you gives you the ability to socialise with others and @a to make you friends to know your friends to to go out with these friends after the sport and and @m this good too for your health as i said before because when you exercise in whatever you are doing @e you you are more more likely to be immune to to bacteria because your your body's stronger so you if you exercise you will be and @m sports can al- can also teach you something and it is like teaching some some principles like being loyal to the others because if you cheat in the sport you will you
