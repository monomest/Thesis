3060107_en_36_29_100	i really think that sports is is really good for you 'cause you can do a healthy activity like running or i don't know i personally do karate and you can find new people you can talk with others i- it's really like funny to do sports with other people and it's good for your health too 'cause yeah it keeps you moving and healthy yo- you really enjoy an activity while you're taking care of yourself and i don't know i think it's yeah i will i would prefer to to do some activities like running or i don't know play with others football @de(oder) other kind of of sports rather than stay on the couch or yeah it's better for your health you meet new people and yeah i don't know i think it's yeah th- the when you do a sports like i think about karate you are really taking a class where you are are knowing better your body you know how much you can move how fast you can run how how powerful is is your body and you can improve that and becoming everyday better and i think it's a a really good thing 
3060113_en_35_28_100	i prefer to live in a small village because i hate the for example the traffic or too much too many people too much people in the @em in a place for-
