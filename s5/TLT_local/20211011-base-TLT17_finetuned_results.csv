488,MMM NO NOT REALLY,M NO NO RIALY
489,WE FOUND OUT THAT ONE WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ANOTHER WIRE HAD TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB,FAOUND OUT THA ON MYI HAD TO BE ON THE SIDE OE THE EHOL ANK AN NOTHR WH HAD TOE BE UN THE BOTM OF THE EBALL
490,UM WE'VE BEEN GETTING A D BATTERY AND UM WE HAD TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO ATTACH THEM SOMEHOW AND GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP,EM WIVEN LING A TV ERLY N A YEATH WE HAD TWO HIES AND WE  HADO A ATCH TEHM SOM HOW AND CEATH A LIKE HOB CICE UP
491,I THINK THAT ONCE THE ELECTRICITY GOES UP THE WIRE ON THE INSIDE THE FILAMENT LIGHTS UP CAUSING IT THE THE WHOLE GLASS BULB TO SHINE,I THINK THA ONCES ALECTRISY CAUSEP THE WY ON THE IN SSIDE THE FLING FITES UFP CAUSING ET THE THE HOL GLASE PAOLEHEIN
492,I THINK THAT IS ABOUT BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT UP I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT WAY,ITHINK ED UTE BECAUSE IN ORO F TO LITE OUP I THINK IE HASTI GO THO THAT WAY
493,SO IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE,S IT'S GOING IN A SSCCO
494,I MEAN THAT UM THE CIRC THE ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRE IN THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY,I INDE THA AM THE SOC LECTRISY IS RUNNING TO THE WAR AR IN THE LIKVE ALI BAC IN TO THE BARLY
