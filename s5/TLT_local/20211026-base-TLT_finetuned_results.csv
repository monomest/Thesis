1238,MAYBE AT NOT BEING AROUND WINDS AROUND NOT ENOUGH WINDS AROUND AND SO IT WOULDN'T BE STRENGTH,MAYBE NOT BEING ROUND WHENE AROUND NOT ENOF WHENS AROUND WENDSOWO B<unk>
1239,WELL IT'S A UH UM AND IT'S LIKE A MAGNET THAT IT'S LIKE KIND A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT CAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE DIFFERENT WIRES AND DIFFERENT MATERIALS SOME OF THE SAME THOUGH,WELL IT'S UM U UM IT'S LIKE UHG'S LIKE<unk>BUT IT'S A LETL BI DIFFREN'TCAUSE YOU HAVE TO DIFFRENT WYERS ANDE MESTERIALES M OF THE<unk>
1240,WELL THE MORE WASHERS ER IT GOES UP IT INCREASES WHEN YOU MAKE MORE WINDS SO IT GOES UP,WHLL THE MORE WATCERS THE ECGOS UP  INCHREES WHEN YOU MAKE MORE WINES SO IT GOS UP
1241,IT PICKS THE MAGNET IS STRONGER SO IT PICKS UP MORE WASHERS,I BIS THE MAGNIT IS STRONGER SO IT PIS UMORE WASHERS
1242,THAT MEANS LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE RIVET AND IT PICKS UP FIFTEEN WASHERS,<unk> A HUNDRIED TIMES AROUND THE RIVER AND I PIKS UP FIFTEEN WASH
1243,WELL THE MORE YOU COIL THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE UM THE MAGNET WOULD BE,WHAL THE MORE YOU KOILE WAIER AROUND THE RIVE THE STRONGER UH UM THE MAGNE WOULD BE
1244,GOOD,GOOD
1245,BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING THE WASHERS IN,BE VERY VERY CAR FUL WHEN YOU'R POOTING THE WATHERS IN
1246,PUT THE WASHERS RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF LIKE JUST ON DIFFERENT SPA PLACES,POTHE WATCHERS RIE ON THOP OF EACHOTHER IN STED OV LIKE JUST ON DIFFRENT SP PLACES
1247,I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU,I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
1248,THERE'S UM SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THEN A WASHER'S GOING INTO THE UM UM THE CUP,THERE IS UM SPACERES BETWEEN THE MAGNITHS AND WATCHERS GOING IND TO THE M M THE CAT
1249,THE MORE WASHERS THEY PUT IN THE MAGNETS SEPARATE THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER,THE MORE WATCHERS THEY POOT IN THE MAGNET SEPPURATE THE FORSCE BECOMES WEEKER
1250,THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE HIGHER IT GETS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE UM THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AREN'T AS UM STRONG,THE MORE SPACES THERE ARE THE HIR I GITS AND IT LOKS LIKE THE UM THE FOR TWEN THE UM STRONG
1251,UM WELL WHEN Y WHEN YOU PUT THE WASHER IN UM IT'S GONNA PU IT'S GONNA PROBABLY BREAK MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNET,UM WWHENWHIN YOU POOT THE WATCH ERIN UM IT'SKIT'S PROBOBLY BRAKE MORE EASALLY BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS AND BTWEN THE MACHMIC
1252,WHEN THERE'S SPACE BETWEEN UM THE MAGNETS UM THE FORCE ISN'T AS STRONG SO UM THEY BREAK EASILY,WHEN THEREIS SPACE BETWIN M THE MAGHMETS AMD THE FORS IS IN'T  TRANG SO UM THEY BRAKE EASIALLY
1253,THERE'S A BIGGER UM LIKE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM WHEN THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,HRE'S A BIGER UMLIKE SPACE BETWEEN UM WHEN THY LIKERYID ON THOP OFE EACHOTHER
1254,N GROUP A B AND D UM THE WASHERS ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND IN GROUP C THEY'RE JUST KINDA SCATTERED AROUND THE CUP,IN GRUP ABE AND THE THE WATHERS ON THOP OF ECHOTHER AND IN GREPS SE THEYAE JUSTN<unk>SKATERD A ROUND THE CUP
1255,WELL IN GROUP C THERE'S ONLY FI IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WASHERS WITH N ZERO SPACERS AND IN A B AND D IT ALL THEY TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS,IN GSTHERE'S ONLY FIE IT ONLY TOOK FIVE WATHERS WITH SERAL SPACERS AND IN AYBY AND DE IT WELTHEY TOOK NINETEEN WATERS
1256,USED THE BALANCE AND WE PUT THE MAGNETS IN THERE TOGETHER AND THEN WE PUT WASHERS IN THE OTHER CUP AND THEN WE TRIED TO BREAK THE FORCE AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN UM YOU PUT UM AND THEN YOU PUT A SPACER IN BETWEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU DID HOW MANY WASHERS COULD BREAK THE FORCE,YUSE THE BAOLENCE AND WE PL THE MAGNMETHS AND THEY I TO GETHER AND THEN WE POL WATCHERS AND THE OTHER CUT AND THEN WE TRIYE TO BRAKE THE FORSE AND WE HOUNTED HOW MANY WATHERS THAT TOOK TO BRAKE THE FORSE AND THNUM<unk>UM AND THEN YOU POL A SPACE IN BETW ALLWTHE SIX SPACERS AFTER YOU D HOW MANY WATCHERS CAND BRAKE THE FORSE
1257,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT TAKES,I KNOTIEST THAT THE MORST SPACERS THERE ARE THE LES WATHERS IT TAKESS
1258,BYE SEE YOU TOMORROW,BYE SEE YOU TOMORROW
1259,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE SPACER UM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS I THINK THAT THE THE FORCE IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT IS A UM THAT THE SPACER IS IN BETWEEN,UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU POT THE SPACE R UM BETWEEN THE MAGNT I THINK THAT THE THE FORIS ALETLB IT'S NATE STRONG BECAUSE OFE THE FACT IT IS U UM THAT THE SPACEERE IS IN BATWING
1260,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM MAGNETS AND THEY SEEING HOW HOW F UM HEAVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,VE IN WIRKING WITH SOME MAGNITHS AND THEY STHINK HOW HO UM HEVY THEY CAN TAKE BEFOR THE FOR BRAKES
1261,UM IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS TOGETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEAK,UM IT MAKES THE FORSE OF THE MAGNMETHS TO GETHER IT MAKES IT MORE WEEK
1262,YOU PUT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BR HOW MANY WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE THAT IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BREAKS,U POT THEM THERE TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FOR HOW MANY WATCHESE YOU POT IN THA IT CAN TAKE BEFORE THE FOR BRAKES
1263,UM IT GETS MORE WIDE AND THE MAGNETS ARE THE FORCE IS LEA IT'S UM WEAKENING,UM IT IT'S MOURE WHIDE AND THE MAGNITS ARE THE FORSES UH IT'S UM WEEKENING
1264,UM THE MORE WASHERS THAT YOU ADD THE EASIER OR WHEN THE THE STRENGTH GETS LIKE LE IT'S NOT AS STRONG SO THEY BREAK APART,UM THE MORE WATCHERES TH YOU HAD EASEAR  WHEN THE STRINGTH GET'S LIK L IT'S NOT IS STRONG SO THEY BRAKE A PARK
1265,WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE UM ER AND THEN WE WE USED A BALANCE AND THEN WE PUT A CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE MAGNETS TOGETHER ON A LITTLE STAND THROUGH THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LONG IT HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD TAKE BEFORE THE FORCE BROKE,WUSTE BOLENCE AND THEND WE POOT SPACERS BTWENUM AND THEN WE EBUNDE OND  WI P A CUP AND THEN WE POL THE MAGMETHS TO GETHER ON A THRO THE CUPE AND THEND WE POOT THE WATCERS ON HY OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW LON IT HOW MANY WATCHERS HIT CUD TAKE BEFORE THE FOREROK
1266,WE LEARNED ABOUT TEMPORARY MAGNETS,WE LEARND ABOUT TEMPERERY MAGMETHS
1267,IT'S LIKE MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEEN 'EM AND IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LON HOW THE FORCE HOW MU HOW BY TOGETHER THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE FOR THERE TO BE ANY FORCE THERE,' LIKE MUSERING THE STRINKTH THE MAGNIETHS WHEN THEY HAVE SPACE BETWEN THEM AN IT'S ALSO SEEING UM HOW LON HOW THE FOR HOW HOW CLOSE TO GETHER THE MAGNETS NEED BE FOR THERE TO BE ANYFTHERE
1268,WE USE THE BALANCE AND WE PUT LIKE SPACE UH WE PUT MAGNETS ON ONE SIDE AND THEN WE PUT UM WASHERS IN IT AND THEN WE PUT SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AH AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE PUT SPACERS WE COUNTED HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK BEFORE THE B FORCE BROKE,USE THE BOLENCE AND WE OLIKE SPACE WE PO MAGMETS ON ONE SIDE ANDTHEND WE POO UM WATCHERSE AND AND THEND WE PO SPACERS BETWEN THE MAGMETS A AND WE COUNTED HOW MANY UM EACH TIME WE POT SPACERS WE CAN D HOW MANY WATCHERS AT TILK BEFOR THE FORBROK
1269,WELL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STICK THEY JUST LIKE PUSHED APART AND THERE WAS REALLY ALMOST NO WAY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PUT 'EM TOGETHER THEY'D GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UM SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FORCE THERE,WHEN THEY DIDN'T WAT A STICK THEY JUST LIKE POUSCH THE PARK AND THEY WAS REALLY ALMOST NOW WAY THE POUITTONE TO GATHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRIYE TO POM TOGETHERE THEY GO LIKE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD WANT TO UH SO UM IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE LIKE THEY WON'T GO TO GATHER BECAUSE OF THE FIRST THERE
1270,E REASON ON ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T STICK IS BECAUSE THE PAPER IS TOO THICK THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORCE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO G GET THAT IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UM IT DOESN'T IT LIKE DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT'S THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T GO IT DOESN'T IT'S TOO IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE MA THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STACK,REASON ON ONE OFE THEM IT DOUSN'T STICK ITS BECAUSE  PAPPER ITS TWO THICK THERE'S TWO MUCH PAPER THERE AND UM THE FORSES 'STRONG ANOF TO GET  IISN'T STRONG INOF FOR THE MAGHNTISOM TO GO TO THE PAPER CLK SO IT DOASN'T IT DUSN'T UM IT DOUSN'T IT LIKE DUSN'T IT DASN'T IT'S THE FORSE OF THE MATHNITISUME DUSN'T GO IT DOUSN'T IT'S TWO IT'S NOT STRONG ANOF TO GO THRO OF THE PAPER THAT'S WHY THE MA THE PAPRIT WASN'T MOVING IN THIS STAK

1274,OH THE ELEC UM THE MAGNETISM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE THE PAPER CLIP MOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE MAGNET,O THE ILIRK UM THE MAGNITISUME ISN'T STRONG INOF TO GO THRO THERE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK THAT'S WHY IT WON'T GO THROW AND THAT'S WHY YOUDON'T SEETHE PAYPRMOVING WHEN YOU MOVE THE<unk>
1275,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON' REALLY KNOW
1276,WELL THE DULL NAIL IS LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET AND A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNETISM IS IN THE IS IN THE UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP STAYS AND THIS IS CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETISM,WHL THE D<unk>IS LIKE A TEMPRRERY MAGHNI AND A TEMRERY MAGNITIS WHEN THE MAGHNETISOME I E IS IN H UM THE OBJECT THEN THE THE MAGNITISOM GOS TO THE PAPER CLIPE IN THE PAPER CLIPS STATE AND THIS IS CALD TEMRERY MAGNATISOMES
1277,UM WE'VE BEEN UH LEARNING HOW MAGNETS CAN UM CHAIN UP AND UH SOME UM IRON OR STEEL OBJECTS CAN BE TEMPORARY TEMPORARY MAGNETS,UM IVE BEN UH LERNNING HOW MAGNITHS CAN UM CHAINE UP AND UH UH SUM UHIURN ORSTIL OBJECT CAN BE TEMPRERY TEMPERERY MAGMIETHS
1278,SOME ARE TURNED THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY STICK TOGETHER AND SOME ARE TURNED THE OPPOSITE WAY SO THERE IS A FORCE THERE THAT PUSHES THEM APART,SUMMER TR IN THE RI WAYES THEY STIC TOGETHER AND SUMMER TER AND THE HOPSIT WAYESE THE IS THE FORSTERE THAT POUSHES THEO PARK
1279,WELL MAGNETISM CAN BE UH USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE PUT 'EM UH YOU COULD LIKE PUT A OBJECT BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS AND THEY'LL STICK TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE UM MAGNETS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T IF YOU PUT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO THICK AND THE MAGNET'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T THEN IT WON'T WORK,WELL MAGHNMETISUM CAN BE UH IS FOR LOT OF THINGS AND UM YOU COULD LIKE TUMSUH YOU COULD LIKE PA OBJECT BTWEN TWO MAGNATS AND THYL STIC TO EACHOTHER THRO THE H MAGNITS BUT WHEN BUT IF YOU DON'T UD IF YOU PAE SOMETHING HAT'S TWO THICK AND THE MAGNIT'S NOT STRONG ANOFE THEN YOU WAN'T THEN YOU WON'T THE I WON'T WIRK
1280,I THINK THAT THE UM THE MAGNET IS GOING ACROST THE UM IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL AND THEN THE SINCE THE MAGNETISM STILL IN THERE IT UM MAKES THE MAGNET IT MAKES THE IT MAKES THE NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,I THINK THAT UH UM THE MAGNI IS GOING ACHROST THE UM IT'S SUNING MAGHNATISUM TO THE NAILE AND THESEN THEMAGMITTISME STYL INHERE IT UM MAKS THE ADNIS  MIXS THE IT MAKS THE NALS STIC THE PAPER CE
1281,I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I DON'T REALLY KNOW<unk>
1282,WELL W WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THE MAGNETS ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN THEY ATTRACT THEY IF YOU TURN 'EM OVER THEN THEY'LL PUSH APART BUT IF YOU TURN 'EM THE OTHER WAY AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT THE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY'RE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL WOR THEN UM THEN IT WILL WORK THE THEY WILL GO TOGETHER BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVER THEY'LL PUSH APART CAUSE THERE'S A FORCE THERE,WL WHEN LIKE YOU COULD WHEN THEY  ATTRACT TO EACHOTHER UM THEY LIKE WHEN HYAT ACT THEY FU TUR OVERE N KNOW PCPARK BUT F YOU TUP THE OTHER WAY IN AERW IN THE RI WAYTHYE TOGETHER THEN UM THEN IT WILL R THEN UM THEN I WIL W THEY THEY WILL GO OGETHERE BUT IF YOU TURN ONE OVERE TOCH THE PARK ECAUSE THERE'S A FOR THERE
1283,WELL THEY'RE THE FORCE CAN BE DEPENDING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS THE FORCE CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOST THROUGH ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU PUT 'EM THROUGH SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NOT UM STRONG ENOUGH THEN IT WON'T GO LI IT WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANT IT TO,WELTHER THE FORTS CAN BE EPENING ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNEDIS THE FORSS CAN BE REALLY STRONG AND IT CAN GO ALMOUST THO ANYTHING BUT WHEN I WOULM DO SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT THAT IF IT'S NAT UM STRONG INUF THAN I WON'T GO BUT I WON'T DO UM WHAT YOU WANTIT TO
1284,AGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S SENDING THE MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP TO THE NAIL,I'S TUTCHING THE NAL IND IT' SENDING THE MAGHMETISOM THRO THE NAL TWO THE PAPER CLIPS SO IT'S ATTRACTING THE PAPPER CLIP TO THE NAME
1285,THERE'S A FORCE THAT PU THERE'S A FORCE THERE THAT PULLS 'EM TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY GO TOGETHER IT'S KIND OF UM THEY JUST LIKE ATTRACT TOGETHER SINCE THEY'RE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU COULD MOVE IT AROUND SINCE THEY'RE STUCK TOGETHER,RE'S A FOR ATTHERE'S A FORERTHATAND TE GETHER AND WHEN THY GO TO GETHER IT'SIM OF UM THEY JUST   TRACT TOGETHER FTAR THE RIDE WAY AND YOU CAN'T MOVE IT AROUNDUMTHERE STDUC TO GETHER
1286,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BE BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DULL NAIL IS NOT A IT'S NOT A MAGNET IT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET MEANS IT'LL ALWAYS STICK WITHOUT EVEN A OTHER MAGNET SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WON'T ALWAYS STICK IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,UM IT'S BECAUSE UH TODAY WHEN WE WERE LERNNING ABOUT IT UM IT IT BIG BECAUSE THE THE UM THE DOT MI IT'S NOT UH IT'S NOT AMAGIT'S CALLD A TEMPRERY MANG BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PREMINAN MAGME A PREMINEN MAGUMETMENS ITWL ALWYS STIC WITHOUT EVEN OTHER MAGNI SO THAT MEENS THAT IT WON' ALWYS STIC IT'S JUST FOR A COPLE M
1287,I'VE OBSERVED THAT SOME THICK THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOME THICK THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO THICK THEN THEY WON'T STICK BUT WHEN YOU SOME THING'S IF THEY'RE NOT THAT THICK THEN THEY WILL STICK THROUGH THERE,I IRVE THAT SOME TIC THINGS CAN UM LIKE SOMETHING THINGS<unk> THAND I WANT STA BUT WHEN YOU SOMETHINGS IF THEYRE NOTATHIC THAN TIY WAT STT THRO THERE
1288,IT SHOWS ME THAT THE MAGNETI THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL ATTRACT AND IT'LL STAY ON THE NAIL,IT SHOS ME THAT THE MAGHNATTHE MAGHNETISUM IS GOING THRO THE NALE TO THE PAPRCI SO THAT THE PAPRCIT WALL ATRACTI SDAY ON THE NAILE
1289,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE NAIL WITHOUT THE MAGNET ON IT WHEN IT GOES TO THE PAPER CLIP TO TRY AND PICK IT UP THE PAPER CLIP DOESN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE SINCE IT ISN'T ATTRACTING THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE NAIL IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY MAGNETISM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT N IT'S NOT A PERMANENT UM MAGNET IT THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANY KIND OF MAGNET IS WHEN THE MAGNET THE PERMANENT IT'S ON IT AND THAT MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET,OH WHEN THE WHEN THE MILL WITHOUT THE MENON IT WHEN IT GOS TO THE PEPPRCITO TRING TO GAT UP THE PEPPURIT DOSN'T ATTRACT SO UM THE THINIT IS N'T ATTRACTING THE THAT MES THE THE NA IT'S DESN'T HAVE ANY MAGUGISUME BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERINA IT'S NOT A PRMINA UM MANG IT'S THE ONLY TIME IT'S ANYONMAGIS WHEN THE MAG THE PREMIN MAG IT'S ON IT AND  TOT MAKES THE NIL A TEMPERRY MAGNT

1294,WELL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT'LL BE THE LIGHT BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER,BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYSE AND WHEN WYOU HAVE TWO PATHWAYS IT LL BE THELYRIER
1295,WELL THE WHOLE FLOW STOPS,WALL THE WHOL FLO STUPS
1296,IF ONE BULB BURMS OUT THEN THEY BOTH THE UM THE OTHER BU THE OTHER BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THE OTHER KIND OF CIRCUIT THEN THEY THEY'D BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH THE SAME UM ENER THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IF WHONE BALL BRMS O THEN THEY BOTH THE UM THE OTHER TH THE OTHER BALL WAS STILKEP WORKING IT'S BECAUSE THE PARLSURKE HAVE TWO PATH WAYES SO IT'S NOT GOING IF IT WAS THETHERSURTHAND THEY THEY' BOTH BORNO BECAUSE THEY'E BOTH GOING THWO THE SAME UM AND THEY BOTHAVE THE SAME MUN ANERGY AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATH WAY
1297,WELL WELL IT ALL STOPS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE MMM BECAUSE Y ONE DIES OUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT SO IF YOU CLICK ON IT THEN THAT MEANS BOTH OF THEM WILL DIE OUT BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IF YOU CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THE THE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CLICK ON THE SECOND ONE IT'LL KEEP GOING SO UH BECAUSE IT'S DEAD AND IT CAN GO THROUGH THE SECOND ONE,O WELL IT ALL STOPS PRETY MUCH BECAUSE M BECAUSE I ONE DISE OUT WHEN YOU CI ON IT SO IF YOU CONTTHE BOTH OF ADYBUT IF YOU CRK OM THE FIRST ONE IF YOU C ON THE FIRST ONE THEN THE THE FLOW WILL STOP GOING BUT IF YOU CE SECEND ON ID L CKEEP GOING SO UM BECAUSE IT'S DAD AND I CAN GO THRO THE
1298,WELL YOU COULD REALLY USE BOTH OF 'EM BUT IF YOU USE UM A SERIES CIRCUIT THEN UM THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GONNA BE MORE DIM BUT IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE AS DIM,YO COUD REALLY WUSE BOTH OF TM BUT FYOU YORSE UM A SERIES SURKE THEN UM THERE PROBOBLY ON BE MORE DAM BUT IF YOU YORSE UHA PERLESKE THAN THEY PROBOBLY WON'T BE AS DAM
1299,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS,WEVE BIEN RIRNING ABOUT PERLO AND SERO SERKET
1300,WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE THEY DON'T GO THEY GO LIKE JUST UM UP AND THROUGH SO YEAH,WL THERE'S AL MY WANT THERE THERE DON'T GO I GO LIKE JUST UM PN THRO SO YES
1301,WELL WHEN YOU BURN OUT A BULB IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN MOSTLY THEY BOTH GO OFF,WHEN YOU BIBAA PEAR LOUSURGK THEN MOST LY THEY BOTH GO OF
1302,BECAUSE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONE THEN IT WON'T WORK VERY GOOD,BECAUSE A PARLOHAS TOT AND IF IT ONLY HAS ONETHEMWORK VERY GOOD
1303,WELL IF YOU USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR UM A CIR A LONG STRING A LIGHTS IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE AS UH UH THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS BRIGHT,O S A PARLFR UAND  LONG STRING O ITE IT'S PROBBLY NOTBE AS UH H THEB ABRITE
1304,IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATHWAY,IN ASERI OKADAY BOTH HAVE THE SAME PATH AWAY

1309,WELL THERE IS ON THERE'S ONLY W UM ONE PA UH THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THE THEY'RE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER,WL THERE IT'S O THERE'S ONLY UM ONE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SOTTHERE THE LYPE OF EBRITER
1310,THEY REPRESENT A PATHWAY,THE REPPRIESENT A PATH WAY
1311,I DISCOVERED THAT UM IT SHOWS WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH AND ONE LIGHT IS THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME,I DESSCOVERD THAT IT SHOS WHERE THE ENERGY GOS THROW AND ONE IS I LIKE THE SAME
1312,IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S A TWO PATHWAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATTERY BUT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE'S ONLY ONE ONE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH BULBS,IN A PEARILELE SURKET THERE'S TWO PATH WAYS BOTH COMING OUT OF THE SAME BATERY BUT IN A SERIES SURKEL THERE IS ONLY ONE ONE WATER THAT CONECT BOTH BOBES
1313,DIFFERENCES UM IS THAT THE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE SAME AND THEY'RE LIGHT AND IN THE OTHER ONE IT'S THEY'RE DIM THEY'RE BOTH DIM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME PATHWAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY'RE GETTING BOTH ENOUGH ENERGY,DIFERENCES UM IS THA THE THE LEARE LIKE THE SAME IND THY LIKE AN IN OTHER ONE IT'S THERE DAM THERE BOTH DAM BECAUSE IT'S GOING THRO THE SAME PATH WAY BUT IN THE OTHER ONES THERE'S TWO PATHWAYSO THERE GATING BOTH ANOF ENERGY
1314,BECAUSE THEN YOUR STRINGS WILL BE LIGHTER AND WHEN THERE'S MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE LIGHT,BECAUSE THEN YOUR STRINGS WILL BE LIER AND MANY HEARS MORE YOU WANT THEM TO BE
1315,WELL THE ONE THAT WORKS IT MEANS THAT LIKE IT WOULDN'T STAY ON IF UM IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYS,THE E<unk> THAT WORK U<unk>IT WOUDN'T STAY ON IF UMIT DIDN'T HAVE TWO PATHWAYES
1316,WELL IT H IT'S BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE TWO PATHWAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAME ONE NOW IF THERE WAS A DEAD BATTERY IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD BATTERY BECAUSE THE BATTERY ISN'T WORKING AND SO IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE IT'S BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAD LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COULDN'T GET TO THE SECOND LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHY IT WOULDN'T STAY ON,O IT IT'S BECAUSE UM THY HAVE TWO PASTH WAYS AND SO THE ENERGY ISN'T GOING TO THE SAO NOW THERE WAS A DEDBATR COUDN'T GO THRO THE DED BETTR BECAUSE THE BETER ISN'T WORKING AND SO I WOULDN'T GO TO THE BECAUSE IT COUDN'T GO THRO THE DED LIFBALL BECAUSE THE LY BALB ISN'T WORKING SO UM SO IT COUDN'T GET THE SECEND LIFEBALL THAT'S WHY WOULDN'T STAY ON
1317,I'M AWESOME,<unk>
1318,UM WELL THEY'RE GOING THROUGH LIKE UM THEY GO AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THEY GO OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH AND THEN IN,M WELL THEY'RE GOING THO LIK UM THEY GO AEROUND BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATH WAYS SO THEY BOTH GO AROUND THE GO OUT THE NEGUIDTIVE SIDE THRO AND THEN I
1319,THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YOU'RE SEPARATING THE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER,THE WATER GOS THRO THE SREEN BUT THE RAXSTAY ND HOP OFITU SUPPRING THE WAT THE ROCXS FROM THE WATER
1320,CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SIEVE BUT THE WATER AND THE MUD CAN,CASE THE ROCXKS CAN GET THRO THE SEA BUT THE WATER AND THE MOD CAN
1321,THE THE UM SALT IS THE THAT THE THING IS THE BEST FOR THAT ONE BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES IT'S USING EVAPORATION TO GET RID OF THE WATER SO YOU CAN GET IT APART SO YOU JUST HAVE THE SALT,THE THE MSCOLITS THE THAT THE THING IT'S THE BEST FOR THWIN BECAUSE IT VAPORATES IT'S USING A VAPERATION TO GET RITD OF THE WATERS OU CAN GET I IN PARK SO JUST HAVE THE SO
1322,A SOLVENT,LVE IN A SAVENT
1323,THE PERSON'S USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PINS OUT,THREE THE PERSONS USING AMDTO GET THEPIZ OUT
1324,I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH,I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT STAYS ON HOPE AND THE THE WATER GOS THROE
1325,GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS UM ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNET,L GET THE PI OUT BECASE HE I U ATTRACTIVE TO MAG
1326,I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION I THINK IT'S A MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT LITTLE BIT OF MIXTURE,I THIK IT'S A MIXTURE AND SALUTION I THINK IT'S MOSTLY SALUTION VA LETLB MIXTURE
1327,BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICLE SIZES SO THAT THE ROCKS,BECAUSE THE ROX AND PARCL SIE SO THAT THE ROXE
1328,MIXTURES AREN'T ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER,MXTURESARE WHIN YOU SUBSTENCT IS OR MORE TOGEATHER
1329,BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THE THE THE UM THE THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT THEY USE THE,BECAUSE YOU NEEDN'T GET THE MAG THE MAG T UM THE THE MAGIN OUT SO THAT SO THAT THE YUS THE MAG
1330,JUST HAD SCIENCE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS I HEARD YOU SAY SOLUTIONS,JUST HALD SCIENCE AND WERE TAKING ABOUT MIXTURS AND SOLUSTIONS I HERED YOU SAY SULUTION
1331,BY USING WATER EVAPORATION AND MAYBE MAGNETISM,IE YUSEING WATER VAPORATIONO MAY BE MAGNITISOME
1332,MAGNETISM,MANGUAGISOM
1333,DO YOU HELLO,<unk>HELLO
1334,I NOTICED THAT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP AND THE WATER STAYS ON THE BOTTOM OR THE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SIEVE,I KNOTIS THAT THE ROCX STAY AND HOP AND THE WATER STAYS ON THE BOTUM ER THE WATR THE WATER GOS THO THE SEEA
1335,YOU'RE USING A SCREEN TO SORT THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER,THERUS IN  SREECH THE ROCXKS FROM THE WATR
1336,MEANS THAT THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO A CLOUD AND THE SALT WILL STAY THE SALT WILL STAY THERE AND MAKE LITTLE CRYSTALS,<unk>THE WATER WILL AVAPPORATE INTER THE INTO A CLOUD AND THE SOLT WILL STAY THE S WIL STAY THERE AND MAKE ALLD CHRISTLE
1337,THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH THE FILTER BUT THE SAND CAN'T,THE WATER CAN LIK THRO THE FI FULTURE BUT THE OM SAND KAND

1440,YOU'RE SEPARATING THE ROCKS OR THE PEBBLES FROM THE WATER,YU SEPPURITE IN THE RAOKS OR THE PEBLES FROM THE WATER
1441,THAT A MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MIX SOMETHING MIX ONE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING,MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MAKE SOMETHING TO MIX ONE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING
1442,BECAUSE EACH ONE HAS DIFFERENT PROPERTIES,BECAUSE EACH WONE HAS DIFRIN'T PROPPORTY
1443,YOU COULD EVAPORATE IT,YOU COUD  VEPRATE IT

1551,BECAUSE ONE THEY'RE BOTH SHARING ENERGY SO IF ONE BREAKS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK,BECAUSE INE THERE BOTH CHEIRING ENEARGY SOW IF ONE BRAKES OUT THAN THE OTHER ONE DOSN'T WERK
1552,I'VE BEEN SICK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ANYTHING,I'VE PINE SIXI HAVEN'T BEN<unk>ABOUT ANYTHING
1553,BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING TOO MUCH ENERGY SO THE FILAMENT WILL,BECAUSE ONE MYE HOBBIES GETING TOO MUCH INOFILMENT
1554,A SERIES CIRCUIT GOES AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY AND A,A SERIAS TIRKY GOIS AROUND PACK UH BARL AND A
1555,THAT THREE WIRES ON SIDE IS SHARING THE ENERGY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SHARING THAT ENERGY OF THE,<unk>THREE WATERS ON ONESIDE OF<unk>THE ENERAGY ON THE OTHER SIDETENERGY OF THE BAL
1556,I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE ENERGY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN IT WON'T WORK,MY HOBIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE FILM IT BRAKES THE ENERGJY NNOPK GO THRO THE FILM AND IND IT WON'T WIRK
1557,ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT,ONE MYHOBHAS ABON FLMEN AND THE OTHER OEIS
1558,I KNOW THAT THEY'RE PARALLEL LINES,I KNOW THAT YOUR PEOLA LIKE
1559,THE SECOND CIRCUIT,T SECKEND SIRKE
1560,GOOD,GIRL
1561,THAT THE SWITCH IS OPEN SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THROUGH,PATLES WHICH IS OPENG SO NOTHING CAN FLOW THOR
1562,THEN ENERGY WILL ONLY GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB THAT'S NOT BURNT OUT,AN IN OGYM ONLY GO TO THE ONE LAYE OHET ISNO<unk>
1563,WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS,<unk>
1564,WE KNOW THAT SERIES CIRCUIT,WE AEE
1565,BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING ENERGY,BECAUSE THO TWO YPE AO H
1566,THE FILAMENT ISN'T WORKING IN ONE OF THE BULBS BUT ONCE YOU GET A RIGHT FILAMENT THE BULB START THE BULB WILL START WORKING,IS WRKING AND WALER BO BT WANTE YOU CAN ARRY E FILMT OW O DO WATERE WARKING
1567,I DON'T KNOW,R DON'T KNOW
1568,THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE SO THE ENERGY,THEF BRAKS ON WNIN
1569,THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP AND SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE SO CAN WE HURRY UP,DY LIKE ALL ING UP AND SOMMONSE ABOUT UNESO CAN WE HARY UP
1570,IT DOES NOTHING IT JUST BURNS OUT AND,IT DOS NOTHINGAB
1571,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE <unk> IS OD
1572,THAT SINCE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THAT LIGHT BULB ENERGY CAN'T FLOW TO THE OTHER,YES SINCE TWO WAERES ARE CONECT IN TO THE LEYBAOBE INAGJICON FOL TO THE OTHER
1573,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY CAN STILL GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT GOES,INDRIK STL GO THRE BECAUSE ITCUS T OTOT
1574,I DON'T KNOW,RE
1575,THE BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB,FOOT POL DUS NOT LIE UP ANY OTHER BALTIS TAT I BECAUSE ELECTRISITY CAN NOT GO THRO THAT VIY
1576,WELL THEN TOO BAD WHEN THE BULBS BURN OUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,AL HAN A WHEN THE BOXEO NOMYPROBE
1577,SERIES CIRCUITS SERIES CIRCUITS CAN UH A BIG CIRCLE PLUG IT IN AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE JUST A BIG LINE OF CIRCUITS,<unk><unk> ARE A BIGTERGL<unk><unk>ITS ORE JUST A BIGT

1579,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T MATTER,WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN A PLSURKAY IT DOUSN'T MATER YE
1580,I KNOW IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS ON,I GO IT' <unk>BECAS I WHICH IS UH

1584,WHAT'S YOUR NAME,WHAT YOUR NAME
1585,ONE LIGHT BULB'S HAVING TOO,ONE PE OF HAVE IN TWO MA
1586,THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED TO THE D CELL,AROGE<unk>
1587,THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS EXCEPT ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A BROKEN FILAMENT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY,THATWO LKPE HOPS HAVE TWO DIFRIN'T PATH WAYS EXSEP ONE LIKE HOBBEHAS A PROGN FILMMENT IN THE OTHER DUSENT SO THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH WAY
1588,THAT ONE OF THEM IS NOT BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS BURNED OUT SO THE FILAMENT IS,NO ONE OT ISNOTIS PURNDOUT SO THE FILMENT IS
1589,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S AWESOME,I THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS ALSU
1590,BECAUSE THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS SHORT,BECAUSE A SHERIS SIRGI A SHIRT
1591,STOP STOPS GLOWING BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB,STAR ITSTARS<unk>BECAUSE
1592,THAT,BO
1593,WE TOOK SOME STEEL UM NAILS AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT ATTRACT AND WHAT WOULDN'T,WE TOOK SOME STYL UM NATLES AND A LOT OF OTHERSTFT TO SEE WHAT WID COME TO GETHER WITHOT UTRACTD AND WHA WOUDN'T
1594,YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP,YOU HAD TO TAKE ETHER THE COMPIES A PAPPER CLIPE OR THE STIL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPIS WOULD POREN NOR TORDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT THE PAPPER CLIPE YOU COULD FEEL GE HAVE YEUR AND WITH THE SHAIVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME OP
1595,THEY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE,ONSTIK IT'S WELL TO OTHER STUF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDNT STICK IFE THEY WERE ALL UN DON
1596,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID,IT DIDN'T ALWAYS THE COL TRIM BUT SOMETIMES A DAD

1600,THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT,THE MAGNITON THE NAL THERE CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PIK UP THE PAPPER CLUBE IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNIT ON IT
1601,A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF,WATER TIMES IT'S<unk>OR METOSTO<unk>
1602,O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO,O THAT<unk>DES WHAT THE MAGNICE CAN DO
1603,THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF F WOULD C WOULD MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF,THEY CAMK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE WHAT THY MADE OUT OF WOULD C AND MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT I COULD SOMETIMES GO THRSTYL
1604,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM,WE EN STUDYING MAGMETISM

1609,YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THEY'LL DEPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS,YES BECAUSE CAR BARD THICK CARBAURD ICAN GO THRO THIN CORBARD BUT THIC CORDBURD CAN'T GO THROW DO'T THING PENDING A PON HOWUSE STRONG THE MATHATIS
1610,YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T,YEAH SOMOF THEM DK WITH SOME SOMMERRNSTK BUT SOME DIDN'T

1612,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER,YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
1613,THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE TH THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO THEY COULDN'T G ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,THEY CAN ATRACT THRO THINGS THAT IR'S THING BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE TH CARDBARD SO THEY COUDN'T ATTRACT THRO SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THRO SOMETHING THAT'S THING LIKE PEZOF PAPPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
1614,WE HAVE PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK S STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ONTO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT,WE HAVE POOT THEM AND BOXES AND THEN TOOK STIL SHAPINGS AND A CUMPIS TO TRI O FIND HEME THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE BECAUSE THE MARNETS WERSTICK TO SJOCK TAPE ON TO THE BOXE WYOU HAD TO TRI O FIND IT

1618,TTRACTED EACH OTHER,FCTATH EVEN
1619,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNETS RUBBED ON TH THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNE IT MAKES IT M A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGHNIC ROB ON THE THE THE NIL THAN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THY RUB TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MACE IT MAKES ABIT MAGHITIC SO E CAN PICK OP THE PAPBERR

1936,I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A LITTLE TUBE BUT THERE IS A THIN WIRE BETWEEN IT THAT MAKES THE ENERGY SQUEEZE THROUGH IT GOING OUT IT GOING OUT IT GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AGAIN AND RECYCLING IT THROUGH THE BATTERY,I KNOW THIS THAT THE ENERGY IT'S GOING THRO A LITLE TWOP BUT THERE IS A THIN WAITER BETWEEN IT TO MAKE THE ENERGY SKWEECKE THRO IT GOING AUTGOING OUTGOING TO THE WAITER AGAIN AND WE CYCLING THRO THE PATRY O THAPK THAPKTAPK<unk>JYMME
1937,TELL YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT,ORE BOU WHE
1938,KINETIC ENERGY AND THEN CLOSED CIRCUIT,CAEDICE ENERGY AND EN CLOSE SURKE
1939,ARE SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DEVICE OR LIGHT BULB SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE,SO YOU CAN P YOURTHEVICCE OR LIKE BOLBS SO IT WILL LI OP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGJY GOAT THERE
1940,I'M TALKING ALL RADICAL COME ON WOMAN TELL ME SOME ANSWERS,UHI'M<unk>UH<unk>

1945,I SEE A CIRCUIT,I SEE A SIRKET
1946,BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TO SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN,BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE EDNERGY FLOW THRO THE WAYERS SO THE TO SO THELE WLS KAN
1947,THE NEGATIVITY SIDE,O<unk>AN
1948,I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABORE YOU
1949,IT FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES GOING TO THE CASING OF THE BULB AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BULB GOING OUT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE MAKING THE BULB HAVE A CIRCUIT LIGHTING IT UP,GOING THO THE WAITERS GOING TO THE CAING OF THE BABE AND THERE IS ANOTHER ONE CONECTED TO THE BOTUM OF THE BABE GOING OUT TO THE PASITTIVSIDE MAKEKING THE BILL HAVE A SURKET RIING IT OP
1950,I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THIS,I KNOW THE THAT THEIAROUND LIKE THE
1951,I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COURSE,I NOTED THAT RIDING UP OF COU
1952,THINK THAT IT WILL NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE NEEDS ONE TO BE AT THE SIDE OF THE BULB FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW OUT CAUSE IF IT'S AT THE BOTTOM THEN THERE'S ONLY JUST ONE BULB CONNECTING TO IT OR I MEAN WIRE,I THING THAT I WILL NOT BRIDE OUP BECAUSE THERE NEEDS ANTE TOBE AT THE CIE OF THE BOB OR THE ENERGY THE FLOW OUT BECAUSE IF IT'S AT THE BOTUM THAND THERE IS ONLY JUST ONE BOBE CANECING TO OR UNING WATER
1953,IS A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT,IT'S THE PAST WAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THRO SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UM LIHE POBC
1954,THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW IF THE ENERGY IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH OR NOT,THELIG IS SPIDING AND ITIS IMPORTNT AND IT IS IMPORTNT BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW IF THE ENERGY IS ACTUALLY GOING THRO OR NOT
1955,I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THAT OTHER METAL CONNECTED TO THE WIRE IT GOES BUT WHEN IT IS NOT AND IT IS SEPARATED IT DOES NOT GO,I KNO THIES THAT WHEN THE WATER IS CONECTED TO THE OTHER METLE CONECTED  THE WAIYER IT GOS BUT WHEN IT IS MARTCH AND IT IS SEPPERATED IT DUS NOT GO
1956,MEANS THE THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY ABSORBING IT MAKING IT GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR,TIN THE SCOLERSELIS CONECTING WITH SUE ENERGY OBSORBING AND MAKING GOT THE WATRS TO THE MOTER
1957,VERY AWESOMENESS,HERRY ARE SUMNIS
1958,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT,WE'VE BEN LERNING SERKETS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A POLSURGA
1959,WHAT MUST HAPPEN IS ENERGY MUST GO THROUGH THE WIRES GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT THE FLAG GO TO YOUR,WHAT MUST HAPPEN IS ENERGY MUST GO THO THE WAITERS GOING THO A SURKIT GOING TO THE MOTER MAKEING ITTHE FLAG
1960,IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE A BATTERY YOU CAN OUT IN THE SUN AND THEN IT WILL GET AND THEN IT WILL GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN IF IT IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRE THE ENERGY WILL FLOW THROUGH THE WIRE TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BUILD IT FROM,<unk>CAING IF YOU DON'T WANT AW<unk> THE PARC YOU CAN GOW OUT IN THE SUN AND THEN IT WILL CAT AND AND IT WILL GETEU FROM THE SUN IF IT IS CANECTED TO THE WATER ITHE ENERGY OF THOSE THORE THE WATER TO WHAT EVER YOU WANT TO BUILLD THAT FROM

1968,WHAT ISN'T HAPPENING IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGY,WHAT IS HAPORING S IN THE SCIRCILIS ANARGY
1969,IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP,IF THE SUN IS OUT THENT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SCO OR SEL MAKE ING IT LITE UP
1970,THE SUN MAKES IT COME TO A REALLY SUNNY DAY MAKING THE SOLAR CELL ABSORB THE SUNS ENERGY GOING THOUGH THE WIRES UM CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO BUT IF IT IS A UM CLOUDY DAY THEN THERE IS NO SUN TO HAVE THE SOLAR CELL UM ABSORB ENERGY FROM SO IT WILL SO THERE IS NO ENERGY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES UM GOING TO THE MOTOR NOT MAKING IT RUN,HE SUN MAKES IT COME TWO LY SUMNY DAY MAKEING THE STOLER SELL ABSORB THE SON EDNERGY GOING THO THE WAYERS UM CONNECTING THE MODER MAKING TO GO BUT ITIT IT'S A UM CLOWUDY DAY THINK THERE ARE NO SIN TO HAVE THE SCOLERS SELL UM CAN ABSORB ENERGY FROM SO WIT WILL SO THERE I'S NO EDNERGY GOING TO THE WAIYRS UM GOWING TO THE MODER NOW MAKEKING IT RUNTHOP
1971,THIS IS ABOUT THE SWITCHES GOING SO IT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TURN IT OFF AND ON WITHOUT MOVING THE WIRES,THIS IS ABOUT THE WHICH IS GOWING SO IT YOU CAN ACTULLY TURN IT OF EN ON WITHOUT MOVING THE WAITERS
1972,THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN,ANDG IS GOING TO IRSURCKIT GOING TO THE MODOR MAKEING GIT RUN
1973,THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT ABSORB ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND IT WOULD STOP,THE SPOLERE WOULD NOT UBSORB ENERGY FROM THE S AND THIY WOULD STAP
1974,WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE D CELL GOING OVER CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING THE MOTOR RUN AND IT IS GOING TO A THROUGH A THROUGH A CIRCUIT,WHY  ARE CONECTING TO THE THISL GOWING OVER CANECTING TO THE MORTER MAKEING THE MORTDER RUN AND IT IS GOING TO ASR<unk>TO ASUR

1978,THE ENERGY WASN'T CONNECTING TO THE OTHER WIRE MAKING IT GOING TO MAKING IT NOT GOING TO A COMPLETE CIRCUIT MAKING IT NOT MOVE OR DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT NOW THAT THE WIRE NOW THAT THE SWITCH HAS BEEN CONNECTED IT IS GOING AGAIN BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLETE CIRCUIT NOW,THE ENERGY WASN'T CONNECTING THE OTHER WAYER MAKE ING IT GO ING TO MAKE ING IT NOT GOING TO COMPLEAT SURKET MAKE ING IT NOT MOVE OR DO ANY THING LIKE THAT BUT NOW THAT THE WAYER NOW THAT THWICH HAS BEEN CANNECED IT IS GOWING AGAIN BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLEAT SURKET NOW
1979,I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING,I KNOW THET SAD IS MYR GOING
1980,THE THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR,IS IMPORTTHIN ABOUT EDINES THAT THE EDNERGY IS GOING TO THE WAIYERS TO THE M
1981,IS SHOWING THAT THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES BOTH WIRES MAKING A CIRCUIT MAKING THE ENERGY MAKING THE ENERGY REUSE ITSELF GOING TO THE WIRE MAKING IT KEEP GOING FOREVER AND EVER UNLESS YOU MOVE A WIRE,I SHOWING THA ATHE ENERGY IS GOING THRO THE WATERS BOTH WATERS MAKING A SURKET MAKEING THE INERMAKING THE ENERGY REU ITSELF GOING TO THE WAITER MAKING IT ITP GOING FOR EVER AND EVER AUND LEST IT MOVE A WATER

2149,OH SOYA DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL IS MUCH MORE YOU KNOW LIKE MUCH IT HAS HOLES FOR THE WATER GO DOWN BUT THE SOIL DOESN'T LET THE WATER GO DOWN AND GET LET IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE THE SOIL WANTS WATER TO GROW SOME KIND OF PLANTS AND THE GRAVEL JUST LETS IT FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING,ALSO I DOSN'T COMPEAR TO RAVLE THE GRABBL IS MUCH MORE YOU NOW I MUCH IT HA HOLS FOR THE WATER GO DON BUT THE SOYILE IS WAT THE GO DON I GALET I GO DOWN ALITTLE MUCH BECAUSE THE SOYIL WANT WATER TO GROW SOMEINDOF PLAY AND THE GRABL JUST LETTE FLOW BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING
2150,I KNOW YOU GET THE SOIL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GROUND TOO,OU GET THE SOYL FROM THE GROUND AND YOU GET THE ROCKS FROM THE GRUN
2151,WE BEEN,TAY WILD W
2152,WE I OBSERVED THAT UM THE WATER GETS DIRTY WHEN YOU POUR WATER ON GRAVEL,WE I OBIRVE THAT M THE WARK IT'S STIRD WHEN YOU POR WATER ON GRAL

2154,YEAH,YEAH<unk>
2155,LIKE IF IT ABSORBS IF DIRTY WATER GETS ABSORBED QUICKER OR CLEAN,IKE IF I ABORBS IF THERE  WATER GET'S OBORBE COICKER OR CLEAN
2156,YEAH CAUSE UM CAUSE THE SO THE SOIL KEEPS EV ALL THE WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN LIKE GROW IT CAN LIKE GROW SOME KIND OF PLANT SO BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE WANT IT TO DRAIN DOWN TO THE LARGE CUP NO THE GRAVEL KEEPS DOWN IT GOES DOWN SL SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLES,YEAH ECAUSE M ECAUSE THE SO THE SOYOL KEEPS OTHER WATER TO ITSELF SO IT CAN CROW IT CAN  GROW SOMEIN Y SO  WE DON'T WANTAT HAPPY WE WANTE TO DRINK THE TO THE LARGE TH TERVO CEEPSTIT GOS DON L SLOWLY BECAUSE IT HAS HOLS
2157,WELL THE SOIL UM ABSORBS MORE WATER BECAUSE WE PUT LIKE FIFTY MILLILITERS IN AND IT BUT IT WON'T LET IT ONLY LET THIRTY FIVE OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET FORTY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO LET FIFTY BUT AT LEAST IT'S BY TO FIFTY BUT IT BUT THE SOIL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOME KINDA PLANT AND AND IT COULD BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SOIL TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO LET MORE WATER OUT AND NOT A LOT,WE<unk>M WATER BECAUSE WE LIKE FIFTY LETERS IN  BUT IT WON'T LEI ONLY LEE THERTY FIVE OU IND THE GRABBL LE FOR THE WAT IT'S A SL AT FIFTY  AT LAST IT'S COST TO FIFTY  UH BUT THE SOIAL KEEPS THE WATER SO IT CAN GROW SOMEAMPN AND AND IT CAND BE HEALTHY BUT WE DON'T WANT A SIP HEALTHY WE WANT TO LETE MORE WATER OU AND NO A LOE
2158,GOT WET,H
2159,PUTTING MORE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WILL USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL SO CAUSE THE POTTING SOIL TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS IT FOR THE PLANT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T IT JUST LETS IT GO DOWN TO THE CUP,POFOMION IS IMPORTANTE BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW AND PEOPLE WL YUSE POING SOYILE THAN GRAL SO CAUSE THE PU TAKES MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABORBIS FOR THE PTHE GRA DAS IT JUST LIKE TO GO DOWN TO THE
2160,WE GOT GRAVEL AND WE PUT IT IN THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT WATER AND THEN AND THEN WE SEE HOW LONG IT FIVE MINUTES TAKES TO DROP WATERS,WE<unk>GRPLE AND WE POUT IN THE CUB THETN WE PO WATER AND A  WE SEE HOW LONG IS FIVE MINIT'S TAKES TO JHOP WATRS
2161,YEAH JUST LIKE THAT,I JUST LIKE AT
2162,I OBSERVED THAT UM Y UM POTTING SOIL IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE POTTING SOIL YOU CAN USE ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT'S DIRT AND IT ABSORBS THE WATER FOR A PLANT SO IT DOESN'T DIE THE GRAVEL KILLS THE PLANT BECAUSE THE WATER JUST GOES DOWN TO THE CUP,I OBER THAT UM M POING SOYILIT'S MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THE GRABLE BECAUSE POING SOIL YOU CAN JS ANYWERE BECAUSE IT'S E AND IT OBSORBES THE WATER FOR  LAY SO IT DUSN'T DI THE GRABCIS <unk>BECAUSE THE WATER IS COSE DOWN IS A COP
2163,THE THING THAT I ORGANIZE IS WHEN YOU USE PA POTTING SOIL IT ABSORBS MORE FOR ITS PLANTS TO SAVE AND THE GRAVEL IT JUST UM UM PUTS IT DOWN IT LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LETS THE WATER FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THAT'S AND THE SO THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN'T GROW A PLANT IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY DATA,THEIS WHEN YOU JUS P PING SOYIL IT OBORBS MORE FOR IT'S PLNTSAE IN THE GRABBLE IT' JUST UM UM POOT'S IT DON I LIKE TAKES THE WATER IT LET'S THE WATR FLOWE DON TO THE BOTM OF THE C THAT'S AND THE SO THE PASO OBORBS MORE THE GRABLE DBECAUSE IT CA GRO P IT'S TOO HARD AND YOU CAN'T THAT'S MY
2164,THE WEIGHT IS THE ROCKS ARE HEAVIER BUT THE WATER COULD STILL GO IN BECAUSE WATER FLOWS THROUGH AND THERE'S HOLES ALL OVER AND THE SOIL YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH CAUSE THERE'S NOT HOLES AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THROUGH SO SOME OF IT JUST GOES DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SOME HOLES AROUND THERE,THE WY  THE OXS ARE HAVYR BUT THE WATR IS TOL GO AND BECAUSE THE WATER JUST ROS TOW IN THORE' HORSE AL O INTE SOYLE ITTTEECAUSE THERE'S NO HORSE AND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE INOF ROOM FOR THE WATER TO GO THORO SO SOMEOFITJES GOS DON BECAUSE IT'S ONLY SOME HORSE AROUNDTHER
2165,IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND IT THE WATER'S DIRTY AND IT KEEPS WHOLE LOT OF WATER ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM,DUSINT COK B ND THE WATER ST AND H KEPWATER ONOITHP IN LITLWATER ON THE PARK
2166,WE WERE DOING WITH SOIL AND ROCKS AND WE PUT WATER AND THEN WE MEASURED THE WATER IN SOIL,WE WERE DOING WSOYIL  AND ROCXK AND WEP  WATER A WE MUSH THE WATER IN SOIO
2167,THE GRAVEL IS HIGHER AND IT HAS MORE MUCH MORE WATER AND THE GRAVEL LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SOIL THE SOIL DROPS LOWER,THE GRA IS HIER AND ITHAS ONE MUCH MORE WATER AND TO RA LIKE DROPS MORE WATER OUT THAN THE SWO THE STOYIOLE DROPS LOWER
2168,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2169,WHEN I USE TABLES I I USE POTTING SOIL THAN GRAVEL BECAUSE THE POTTING SOIL ABSORBS MORE WATER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS ONLY ROCKS AND THE POTTING SOIL IS DIRT SO IT SUCKS THE WATER UP FOR THE PLANT SO IT CAN LIVE THE GRAVEL IF YOU HAD A PLANT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GRAVEL IT WOULDN'T IT'LL JUT LET IT GO DOWN AND THE PLANT WOULD DIE,WHEN I EAS TABLES I I AS SPATING SOYO THEN GRABLE BECAUSE THE PAING SOYOL ABSORBES MORE WATER THAN THE GRABLE BECAUSE THE GRABLE IS ONLY ROCXKS AND THE POST SO IT SOC THE WATER UP FOR THE PA SO I CAN LIVE THE GRABLE IF YOUHAD PLAY WITH THE WITH E WITTHE GRABLE IT WA JUST LETGO DO IN THE PANWOU
2170,BECAUSE UM SOMETIME THE THE POTTING SOIL IT'S GOOD AT UM ABSORBING THE WATER TO GROW AS PLANTS TO GIVE THEIR PLANTS HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVEL DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREADY INTO THE ROCKS AND THE AND THE THE POTTING SOIL OF THE AMOUNT OF DRAIN ISN'T BECAUSE IT KEEPS IT IN THE GRAVEL THE GRAVEL UM LETS IT OUT,BECAUSE I'M SOMETIME THE THE PAING SOYL IT'S GOOD UH UM ABSORBING THE WATERPLANT GVTHE PINT HEALTHY BUT THE GRAVLE SBECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALREDY INTO THE ROCK AND THE AND THE THE PAING SOYL OF THE AMOUNTH OF DRAIN IT'S BECAUSE IT KEEPS ITHE GRAVLE THE GRAVLE UMLETS OUT

2175,THE WATER DRAINS WI UM WITH THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS LIKE HOLES BECAUSE IT'S ROCKS AND THEY LEAVE LOTS OF SPACE SO THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A LOT OF UH WATER IN IT AND THE THE SOIL DOESN'T THE SOIL KEEPS IT,THE WATER DRINKS WITH UM WITH THE GRALE BECAUSE THE GRAL HAS LIKE HORSE BECAUSE ITSRPALOT OF SPACE THE WATERCSEREALLY SLOW AND IT HAS A WLAT OF A WATER ANDT IND THE THE SOY USTHE SO PS IT

2177,THE SOIL IS MUCH MORE HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOIL AND MORE WATER IN THERE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE S I MEAN THE SOIL DIDN'T LET THE WATER OUT AND THE GRAVEL LET THE WATER OUT SO THE GRAVEL'S MUCH MORE LIGHTER THAN THE SOIL,THE SOYIL IS MUCH MORE AVRE THAN THE GRAVLE BECAUSE THIT IS MORE SOO AND MORE WATER IN BECAUSE U GRAOL DIDN'T LETE THE WATR OU IN THE AND IN THE SOYILE IN LETE THE WATER ON THE GRAL THAN THE WATR OU SO THE GRAE MUCH MORE LIDER THAN THE SOYL

2648,UM WELL YOU'D NEED TO CONNECT THE SHINY THING TO THAT LITTLE SWITCH OR CONNECT THE SWITCH ITSELF TO THAT WIRE HOLDER,UM WHY YOU NEED CAN NEXANYTHING TO THATTL SC OR CAN ACT THE SWAC IT'SELF TO THAT WHY LD
2649,NO BECAUSE THE METAL IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER PIECE OF THE METAL,NO BECAUSE THEADO IS NOT TATCHING THE OTHER THE
2650,WELL THE WAY WE DID IT TO UM SEE WHICH WAS CONDUCTORS AND UM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER WORD BUT THERE A SWITCH THING WE WOULD CONNECT THE CONDUC THE UM OBJECT TO THE SWITCH,THEWTHEAUTHE CONDUCTERES AND ONI CAN HE OTHER WIRD BUT TH THING WE WOL CANNECT THE CONDUCT THE ON OUBJECT WITH THE WCH
2651,HELLO,NO
2652,THE UM ELECTRICITY WELL THE MOTOR JUST SWITCHED ITS DIRECTION,THE ACTIOU<unk>WHLL THE MORTER JUST WCH ADSTRACTION
2653,YES BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET THROUGH THE SWITCH SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT,YES BECAUSE A LOCJERESICAN GET THRO THE SWIPH SO IT'S A CLOSESURKAY
2654,WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO WORK BUT UM BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY UM COMES BACK INTO THE PO POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN COMES BACK THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER WORK,WL THE  LECTOSEE HASFLOW FROM THE NEGUTIVE SIDE IS THE POSITIVE SIDE FOR TBABLE TO WORK UH UM BECAUSE THE LECTRISITY UM COMES BACK INTO THE POTH HORSE TAVESIDE AND THEN COMES BACK IS UH NEGUTIVESIDE TO MAKE UHH ALECTRISCITY RESEY FOR WARLK
2655,UM WELL THIS ONE IS A SWITCH A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY THE OTHER ONE WASN'T BECAUSE IT HAS THIS IT HAS AN OPEN SWITCH AND THEN WI AND THEN THERE'S A BATTERY AND THEN THERE'S A LIGHT BULB,UM WHLL THIS WHEN IT'S A SWICH VOLLEYBALL AND A BATR THE OTHER ONE WASN'T BECAUSE HAD'S A  IT HAS N'T OPPEN SWICH AND THEN WITH AND THEN THERE'S A BATERE AND THEND THERE'S A LAYBOLLE
2656,WELL BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTED BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR,WELL BECAUSE IIT'S CANECTED BECAUSE THE BOTORY IS CAONECTTED WITH THE MEARTER
2657,WELL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING FIRST YOU COULD DRAW IT WITH A SCHEMATIC UM DIAGRAM AND THEN YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE IT INSTEAD OF JUST WORKING WITH ONLY THE CIRCUITS AND STUFF,WHL WHEN YOUR TRING TO NVENT SOMETHING FOISTS YOU CAND DRA WITH E SGHYMMATIC UM TIEOGRAM AND THEN YOU CAN TRY TO MAKE IT INY SUB JUCT WORKING WITH ALL M THES SURKEST INSTUF
2658,YES,YES
2659,IT WELL THE SWITCH WILL IF IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT A CLOSED SWI A CLOSED SWITCH IT WILL UM IT WILL LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT'S CLOSED AND IT HAS METAL THAT WILL LET ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH IT AND WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT WILL IT DOESN'T HAVE THE METAL T UM CLOSED SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GET THROUGH,IT WL THE WICH WIL IF IT'S A CLOSCE SURKE U CLOSE A CLOSE WICH IT WIL UM IT WALL LOT E ALECTICSTE GO THROEO BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE AND IT HAS N'T MET AL THAT WILL LIT ALLECTICSEE YO THREE AND WENT IN OPENSURCE IT WIL IT DON'T HAVE THE METO UM CLOSCE SM THE ELECTTRICITY CAN'T GET THE REL
2660,WELL IT IT CAN SHOW YOU LIKE HOW THINGS ARE POSITIONED BUT YOU JUST NEED LIKE A KEY TO KNOW WHAT THINGS ARE SO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE LIKE A DIAGRAM OR ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T REALLY TELL WHERE THE THINGS WERE,WELL UH IT CAN SHOW YOU LIKE HOW THINGS ARE PASSITION BUT YOU JUST KNEED LIKE A  TO KNOWHAT THINGS ARE SO IF YO DIN'T HAVE LIKE A DIEGRAM OR ANYTHING YOU CAN REALLY TEALL WHERE THE THINGS WERE
2661,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND HOW IT GETS TO UM ELEN ELECTRICITY RECEIVER TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER OR THE THING THAT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY WORK,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ALLECTTICITY AND HOW ITD GET'S H UM ALECTTRITY RESEEVER TO MAKE THE ALECTTIITY RESEEVER OT THE THING THAT RESEEVE ALECTTRICTY WRK
2662,BECAUSE THE SHORT LINE AND THE LONG LINE ARE THE BATTERY AND THEN THE STRAIGHT LINES ARE THE WIRES AND THE CIRCLE WITH THE UM CURLY Q THING IS A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE TWO DOTS ARE THE SWITCH,BECAUSE THE SHIRT LINE F THE LONGLINE ARE THE BATERE AND THEN THE STRET LINES ARE THE WAIERS AND THE SURCLE WITH UH UM CIRLLYING  IS LAYBAL AND THE THE TWO DOTS ARE THE SWIPCH
2663,THAT,ET
2664,A COMPLETE CIRCUIT IS WHEN THERE IS UM WIRE THAT CAN GET AROUND FROM THE BATTERY TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND BACK AGAIN,I CAMPLEAT SURKET ITS WHEN THERE IS UM WITER THARE CAN GET ROUND FOME THE BATERY TO THE ALLECTICITY RESEEVER AND BACK AGAIN
2665,YOU CAN MOVE THE SWITCH SO THAT IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE SO IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR RUN AND IT WILL LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH,YOU CAN MOVE THE SWIPH SO THAT IT'S TUTCHING THE WIYER SO IT WILL MAKE THE MOTER RUN AND IT WILL LOTE THA LECTRICT FLOTHOR
2666,YES IT IS,YES
2667,WELL A CLOSED CIRCUIT IS WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED SO IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT,WLL A CLOSESURKA IT'S WHEN JHUST WCH IS CLOSE SO IT LETZ ALECTISITY RUN THROW IT
2668,YES I DO,YES I D<unk>
2669,UM THERE'S AN OPEN SWITCH AN OPEN SWITCH THAT SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING,UM THERE IS AN OPPEN SWIP AN OPPEN WIP SO THE MIRDER IS NOT RUNING
2670,IT IS A BATTERY AND A MOTOR BECAUSE THE BATTERY SENSOR THE S THE LONG LINE AND THE SHORT LINE AND IT HAS THE WIRES THE WIRES AND THEN IT HAS THE MOTOR UM AND IT HAS THE MOTOR,YH IT'S A BATERE AND MOTER BECAUSE THE BATERE INTER THE THE LONG LINE AND THE SHORT LINE AND IT HAS THE WIERS THE WATERS AND THEN IT HAS THE MOTER UM AND IT HAS THE MOTER
2671,IT TRAVELS THROUGH A CIRCUIT AND IT AND THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GETS TO THE ELECTRICITY RECEIVER AND THEN IT COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE SIDE AND THEN IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING,IT TRAVOLS THRO A SURCKET AND IT AND E LECET TO SEE COMES FROME THE NEGITVE SIDE AND GET'S TO THE ALLECTTCSEY RESEEVER AND THEN IT COMES BACK IN TO THE PASITIV SIDE HID AND  JUST KEAPES ON GOING
2672,IT IS A PICTURE OF A BATTERY AND IT HAS A CIRCUIT THAT'S GE AND THERE'S A SWITCH THEN IT'S GETTING INTO A LIGHT BULB,IT IS A PICSHERE OF A BATERE AND IT HAS A SURKOT THAT'S AT AND THERE IS WC THEN IT'S GETING INTE LAYO
2673,THAT THE WIRES ARE IN A CIRCULAR POSITION AND GETTING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND THEN BACK AGAIN,THAT THE WATRS ARE INA SURKULAR PESITION AND GETING FROM THE BATERY IS DER AND UND BACK AGAIN
2674,I'VE USED A SWITCH SO THAT YOU CAN TURN SO THAT YOU CAN LET THE ELECTRICITY GO TH SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE MOTOR STOP OR GO ON AND THE SAME WITH A LIGHT BULB MAKE THE LIGHT BULB GO OFF OR GO ON,YWITCH SO THAT YOU CAN TURN SO THAT YOU CAN LAKE THE LECTOD SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THOM ODER STOP OR GO ON IND THE SAME A VALLEYBALL MAKE THE LEYBALL BUT GO OF OR GO ON
2675,WELL UM WE'RE STUDYING HOW MAGNETS REACT TO EACH OTHER AND HOW THEY ATTRACT CERTAIN THINGS,ETHOW MEGHM E ARE EACHOTHER AND HOW   ATTRACTSERTON THING
2676,NO,NS
2677,BECAUSE IT E DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT,E IT ISN'T HAVE UND OR STIL
2678,REPELS FROM THE OTHER MAGNET AND WILL NOT LET THEM COME NEAR AND THE TWO ON THE TOP ARE ATTRACTED ALSO,HOUSE FROM TE OTHER MAGNATES IN VOLOH BA TIM COME NEARE AND TW UNDER THOPORED TRACITDALES

2687,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY,HAO<unk>MAGHMATISOME AND ALECTISCITYY
2688,I'M TRYING TO THINK,
2689,BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IF THERE'S TWO THAT GIVES UP GIVES OFF A LOT MORE ENERGY SO,BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IF THERES TWO THAT GIVE P GIVES OF A LOT MORE ENEARGYS
2690,MMM HMM YES,S
2691,W WE DIDN'T QU WE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH TIME WE WERE TRYING MANY MANY THINGS AND THEY JUST WEREN'T RIGHT SO WE R RAN OUT OF TIME,WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T WI HAVE ANOFE TIME WE WERE TRING MANY MANY THINGS AND LAY JUST WO FRITE SO WE HAVET
2692,A SERIES,A SEARIES
2693,UM WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE WIR OR TWO OF THE LIGHT BULBS AND YOU CONNECT THEM WITH ONE WIRE OR TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT'S DIMMER YES YES WE DID,UM WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE WHY OR TWO T OBS AND YOU CONECT AD WITH ONE WHYER OR TWO WHARS TOGEATHER IT'S DYIMMER YES YES WE DI

2695,THREE,THREE
2696,ONE,ONE
2697,OKAY YES UM TODAY WE WERE WORKING ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO WIRES AND YOU CONNECT IT TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO OTHER WIRES AND YOU CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER WIRE SO IT HA GIVES YES TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND IT GIVES OFF A BRIGHTER LIGHT,YES UM TO DAY YOU'E WORKING ON A PEAR LOW SURCKET IND THA SEERIE SURKETAND A PEAR LO SURKET ES WHEN YOU HAVE ONE BATERY AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO WAIRSAN OU CONECT IT TWO ONE LIYCPE BOL AND THEN YOU TAKE TWO OTHER WAIRS AN YOU CONDECT IT TWO ANNOTHER WIER SO IT HA IT GIVES YES TO ANOTHER LICE BOB AN IT GIVES OF A RIDER
2698,MMM NOPE WE DID CONDUCTORS CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT UM ENERGY WILL GO THROUGH,UM NO WE DID CONDOCTERS CAONDOCTERS ARE THINGS THAT UME ENERGY GO THOW
2699,THE LIGHT GOT VERY DIM,LIKE  VERY DM
2700,YES,YES
2701,A WIRE,A WYFE
2702,IT HAS TO IT HAS TO GO IN A CIRCLE FOR IT TO ACTUALLY GO OFF YES UH CONNECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IF LIKE IF THAT ONE DIDN'T CONNECT TO THAT ONE IT WOULD NOT GIVE OFF ENERGY BECAUSE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'LL GO UP INTO THIS ONE AND LIGHT IT UP AND THEN IT'LL GO OVER TO THIS ONE LIGHT UP AND IF THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THIS ONE JUST WOULDN'T LIGHT IT WOULD BE ALL BY NO,IT HAS IT HAS TO GO  THE SURCLEACYES  CONECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IF IWT CONA WHEN IT WOULD NOT GIVE OF ENERGYCBECAUSE THIS WAY L GO UP INUP AND GO THIS ONE LTANTH WASN'T THERE THJWOD LIKE IOULD BE ONO
2703,WELL WHAT'S GOING IS THIS IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP AND THAT IS GIVING OFF THE D CELL IS THE SAME ONE IS GIVING OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE SO IT MAKES IT LIGHT,WEA WHAT'S GOING ON IS THIS IS GIVING OF <unk>TO KE IT LED P AND THAT IT'S GING OP THE IS THE SAMEONSEINGOF NY
2704,IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY WERE ALL THE SAME LIGHT L YES YES,IT WAS STIL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY ERE ALL THE SAME LIKHE YES YES
2705,I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE THAT,I THINK IT GOS IK V AND KE
2706,YEAH,YEAH<unk>
2707,UH NOT REALLY,UH NOT REALLY
2708,WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS THAT WHAT WE TRIED DID NOT WORK CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD WORK THAT THAT WOULD WORK BUT IT DIDN'T CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THOSE HAD TO CONNECT BUT NOW THAT I'M LOOKING BACK ON WHAT I DID I THINK IT DOES NEED TO CONNECT,WHAT SEPRISE E S THE MOST WAS THAT W WE TRYE DID'T UM WORKCAUSE I THOT THAT THIS WOUD WORK THAT THAT WOULD WORK BUT IT DIDN'T CAUS I DIDN'TTHING<unk>I'M LOKING BACK ON WHAT I DID I THINK IT DOSN'T
2709,TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE MISS DUNN TOLD US THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE THIS,TWOBECAUSEO<unk>TWO<unk>S TO MAKE THIS
2710,NO YES WE HAVE MMM HMM,NO YES WE HAVEM
2711,NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED THAT THAT MEANS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY SO YES,NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONECTITD THAT MENDS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR WAN'T O THAT WY YES
2712,YES,YES
2713,AND THOSE ARE TH N N AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A WIRE THAT WENT THROUGH ONE OF THE METAL THINGS AND THEN IT WOULD GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE THE TWO WIRES AND WE WERE TRYING TO OUT THEM ONTO THE BATTERY SO IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS SO IT WOULD BE BRIGHTER,AND AL DO IT AND THEND THER LD BE A WYER THAT WENT THOR ON THEME THINGS AND THEN I WOULD GO THOR ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE AND THEN WE WUL TAKE THE TWO WIS AND WE ERE TROING TO POT THEM ON THE BATRY SO LOOK LIKE THIS SO ITD BE BRTE
2714,WE QU DIDN'T QUITE FIGURE IT OUT YET WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO TWO LIGHT BULBS,WE DIDN'T FIGYOR YET WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO TWO E HOBS
2715,OKAY,OKAY
2716,BECAUSE THE BATTERY WOULD STILL GIVE OFF ENERGY AND IT WON'T AFFECT THAT ONE,BECAUSE THE BETR WAS TO GIVE OF ENERGY AND IT WON'T OFECTT
2717,YES,YES
2718,NOTHING,NOTHING
2719,WE WERE TRYING TO CREATE A CIRCUIT MMM HMM A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE PRETTY MUCH IT'S WHERE THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH ONE SIDE THE BATTERY GOES TO SOMETHING MAKES IT LIGHT UP OR RUN AND THEN GOES AGAIN THROUGH AND THEN IT'LL JUST MAKE A CIRCLE CIRCUIT YES NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS CAUSE IT CAN GO EITHER WAY OR IT CAN GO BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME,WE RE TRYING TO CRAY AKA SURKIET IS  SURCL PRDY MUCH IT'S WERE THE EDNERGY GOS THO ONE SIDE IN BUTRY GO TO SOMETHING MIXU OR RUN AND THEN GO AGAIN THROW AND THEN A JMAKE A SURCLE YESNO I DON'T THINK THERE IS ICAUE IT CAN GO ETHER WAY OR CAN GO BOTH DERACTIONS AT THE SAME TIME
2720,WELL BECAUSE IT WAS SHARING OFF THE SAME UM WIRES AND THE WIRE COULDN'T N THE BATTERY COULDN'T PULL OFF ENOUGH ENERGY TO G THE WIRE TO GIVE TO THE BATTERIES BUT WHEN IT'S SEPARATE IT GIVES OFF MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE AND NOT OFF THE ONE,WELL BECAUSE IT WIS SHAR I OF TO SEE UM WAYERS AND THE WAYER CON  THE BATR CON POOL OF ENOF ENERGY TO THE WYER TO GIVE TO THE BATORIES  WHEN IT'S SEPPORITE IT GIVES OF MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFRENT AND SEPPRIT AND NOT OF THE WONE

2723,OKAY,HO
2724,OKAY,Y
2725,YES,S
2726,YEAH,
2727,THEY DON'T WORK,THEY DON'T O
2728,WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES EACH BATTERY WILL BE A SOURCE FOR THE LIGHT BULB FOR EACH LIGHT BULB AND IT'LL BE BRIGHTER,WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATRS EACH BATL W WILL BE AS SHORSE FOR THE LEYBALL FOR EACH FLEYE BHOLP AN RBY BRIDER
2729,YES I CAN UM I CAN TELL YOU FOR ONE THING THESE ONES NEITHER OF THESE ARE PARALLEL BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM GO LIKE THAT AND THAT N ALL THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING SEE LIKE THAT,YES I CAN UM I CAN TEL YOU FOR ONE THING THES ONE NEEATHER THES E PERLAL BECAUSE NEETHER OF THEME GO LIKE THAT AND THAT AL H WYIS URE TUCN<unk>LIKE THAT

2740,OKAY NO NOT AT ALL,OKYNO
2741,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATTERY'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO GIVE OFF TO THAT ONE IF THAT ONE'S BROKEN THERE'S NO ENERGY TO GIVE OFF TO THE OTHER RECEIVER,IT DOSN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATOR ISPUT TO GVE OF EDENGY THIS WANT TO GIVE OF THE YWI TH I'SE BROKEN THERE'S NO EDNGY TO GIVE OF O THE RESEEVER
2742,NO,NO
2743,WELL SAME THING IF IF SAY THAT WASN'T THERE THEN THAT ONE WOULD GET OFF ENERGY TO THAT ONE BUT IF THIS ONE WEREN'T THERE THEN IT WOULD NOT GET ANYTHING EVE IF BUT IF THERE WAS A SWITCH HERE IF THIS WERE THERE AND I DID THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IT WOULD GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN IT WOULDN'T QUITE MATCH UP WITH THAT IF THAT WASN'T THERE AND THEN IT'S GONE,WEAL  SAME THING IF IF S THAT WASN'T THERE THEN TO N WOULD GO OF ANERGY THA BUT IF THISN WAR THERE THAN IT WOULD NOT GET ANYTHING IF IF BUT IF THERE WAS A SWICH HERE IF THIS WER THERE AND I DIDNNT THEN IT WOUD' REALLY WORK BECAUSE I WOULD GO THR HERE AND THEN IT WOULD WITE MATCH A BOOD THAY IF THAT WASN'T THERE AND THEN IT'SGON

3426,WELL THE THERMOMETER HELPS YOU MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THINGS IT YOU WOULD PUT IT IN LIQUID OR YOU COULD HOLD IT IN THE AIR AND EVENTUALLY THE MERCURY INSIDE OF IT WOULD EITHER EXPAND AND COME UP THE TUBE OR COME DOWN AND THEN YOU WOULD READ THE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS,WELL THETE MOMETER HELP SEE YOU MESJER THE TEMPEITURE OF THINGS IT YOU WULD POOT IT IN LEICUAD OR YOU COULD HOLD IT IN THE AR AND AVENTUALLY THE MERKHERY INSIDE OF IT WOULD ETHER EXPAND IN COME OP THE TUB COME DOUN IN AND YOU WULD REEAD THE NOMBERS ONSIDE AND FIGEUREAL HOW MUCH THE TEMPEITURE WAS
3427,UM WELL A AND C THEY'RE BOTH AT TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS SO THAT TELLS ME THAT THEY ARE TWENTY IS HIGHER THAN FIVE SO THEY ARE THE WARMEST AND B IS THE COOLEST,M WAN SEEA THEY'E BOTH AE TWENTY DEGREEACE  SO THAT TELS ME THAT THEY ARE TWENTY IT'S HIRE THAN FIVE SO THEY ARE THE WARMEST COOL
3428,YES WE ALSO RECORDED OUR MEASUREMENTS UP ON THE WHITE BOARD AND ALL THE OTHER TEAMS DID THE SAME THING AND THEY RECORDED THEIR'S TOO AND WE COMPARED OUR ANSWERS,YES WE ALSO RECORDED OR MESGERMENTS OPON E WHIBORD AND ALL THE OTHER TEAMS DID THE SAME THING IN THEY RECORTED THERE TWO AND WEE COMPEARE THE ANSURS
3429,WELL THE CUP ON THE FAR LEFT LOOKS LIKE THE WATER IN IT IS VERY WARM BECAUSE IT'S FIFTY CELSIUS AND THEN THE CUP ON THE FAR RIGHT HAS ICE IN IT SO IT'S COLDER AND IT'S TEN CELSIUS,WL THE COP ON THE FUR LEFT LOOKS LIKE THE WATER AND IIS VERY WARM BECAUSE IT'S FIFTY AND COP ON THE FURIGE HAS ICE ANIT SO IT'S COLORS IN IT'S TN
3430,WELL THEY WERE EACH FILLED WITH UM DIFFERENT TEMPERATURED WATER SO B WOULD HAVE ICE AND THEN C WOULD BE WARMER AND THEN A WOULD BE THE WARMER AND THEN YEAH,WELL THEY WR EACH FILD WITH OM DIFFRENT TEMPEITURE WATER SO BE WOULD HAVE ICE INNSE WOULD BE WARMER IN IT WOULD BE THE WARMER INYEARH
3431,WELL WE LEARNED THAT PARTLY HOW TO USE THERMOMETERS AND ALSO HOW TO MEASURE WATER WITH THEM,WL WE LEARN THE PARTLY HOW T SE SORMOMEDERS AND ALSO HOW THE MESER WATER WITH THEM
3432,WELL FAHRENHEIT IS HIGHER OR SO FOR EXAMPLE THE ROOM TEMPERATURE MIGHT BE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BUT IT WOULD BE UM LESS IN CELSIUS BECAUSE YEAH,WELL N<unk>IS HIER OR SO FOR EXAMPLE THE RUM TEMPETURE MY BE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES<unk>BUT  OULD BE ON LES IN SEUS BECAUSE YEAH
3433,WELL IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE USED FAHRENHEIT WE WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND IT WOULD BE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO CONVERT THE FAHRENHEIT TO CELSIUS,WELL IT WAS IMPORTNT BECAUSE IF WE <unk>WE WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFRENT ANSERS IN IT WOULD BE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO CONVIRTTHEE<unk>

3435,HE IS USING HIS FINGER TO TRY TO SEE IF HE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT WHICH ONE'S THE HOTTEST AND AND THEN IN ORDER TO THE COLDEST,HE IS USING HIS FINGER TO TRY TO SEE IF HYOU CAN FIGYER OUT WHY WHITH WANIS THE HOLLEST IN IN IN IN ORDER TO THE COLDEST
3436,YES BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD MORE ICE WATER THAN HOT WATER AND THIS LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIXTY DEGREES,YES BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD MORE ICE FWAER THAN HOT WATER AND THIS LOOKT LIKE UH MIE BE SIXTY DOGRETS
3437,WELL ESTIMATING IS KIND OF LIKE GUESSING IT'S WHERE YOU KNOW SOME HINTS ABOUT IT BUT YOU HAVE TO GUESS P ON PART OF IT,WELL ESTOMATING IS CIND OF LIKE GESING IT'S WHERE YOU NO SOMEHINTS ABOUT IT BUT YOU HAVE TO GES ON PART OF IT
3438,WELL THE A AND THE C LOOK LIKE THE SAME TEMPERATURE AT TWENTY AND B IS THE COOLEST BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS,WL THE A AND SEA LOOK LIKE THE SAME TEMPETURE AT TWENTY AND BE IS THE COOLIEST BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT FIVE DEGREES US
