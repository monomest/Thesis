05062-16337 
05062-16338 THE PANDA 
05062-16339 
05062-16340 WHY DID IT PANDAS THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE A NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL DOWN NAME COLUMBUS 
05062-16341 IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WAS FAT 
05062-16342 FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLE 
05062-16343 THE TURTLES MINDS A BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SISTER 
05062-16344 HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS 
05062-16345 HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BE WAS TO BE ME 
05062-16346 AND 
05062-16347 NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE 
05062-16348 SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WAS IN A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FOR TO 
05062-16349 
05062-16350 FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IS TIME TO FEED THE TIGHT 
05062-16351 FOR FED WHEN HE CAN THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HAIR 
05062-16352 ACTUALLY IS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE FINE WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS 
05062-16353 THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THERE WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY 
05062-16354 THERE WERE IT THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER 
05062-16355 
05062-16356 MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY 
05062-16357 SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE 
05062-16358 BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS 
05062-16359 THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF THE PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FATHER LOVE WITH THEM IT'S ALL OF NATURE AS 
05062-16360 IS AT FOR THE DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS 
05062-16361 FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT TO BE DANGEROUS 
05062-16362 SO ALL THE THE PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME 
05062-16363 IT'S INTERESTING TO PLANE OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT THE ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE THERE STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED 
05062-16364 THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS THE THAT'S 
05062-16365 EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO 
05062-16366 ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME OF THE ZOO THE ZOO 
05062-16367 I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS THE WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU IN YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY 
05062-16368 IS NOT THE YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IS IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AND THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE IN THE FIRST BUT 
05062-16369 I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN 
05062-16370 
05062-16371 THE THE STARTING TO FIELD UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF THE HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID 
05062-16372 IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE OF I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US 
05062-16373 
05062-16374 AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONLY A MEAN 
05062-16375 BESIDES IF YOU BE THE ALL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME ANY TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM 
05062-16376 BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING FRED TO SAW CAN HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON 
05062-16377 YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO 
05062-16378 YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON 
05062-16379 HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THE AND WANTED TO THE MOON

05062-16389 I DON'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN 
05062-16390 YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO 
05062-16391 BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED SUPPORT BY TAKING A NOT 
05062-16392 BUT BEFORE A FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE WHICH WOULD BE BEST TO FLAT

05062-16399 BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED OH 
05062-16400 THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND 
05062-16401 MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE IN THE THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED

05062-16413 THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TO A 
05062-16414 WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD IF SHE WANTED 
05062-16415 
05062-16416 A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR 
05062-16417 IT TURNS OUT THE THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT WENT TO GET OVER THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY DIDN'T IF I CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING 
05062-16418 NOW WHILE THIS IS A GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS BEING THE PANDAS LIKE USED THE BUS DO 
05062-16419 THE ONE DAY AFTER FRED FED THE PANDAS I WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WAS YOUR PANDA FRED HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
05062-16420 THEY CAN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO THE MOON TO THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE AND R SAID FRED 
05062-16421 OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT IN THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT 
05062-16422 THIS IS JUST THE TOP OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME 
05062-16423 
05062-16424 FRED THOUGHT READ IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS 
05062-16425 THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS THE THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT 
05062-16426 WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS CITY WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER 
05062-16427 YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO IT THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEP MANAGER 
05062-16428 WELL IT SEEMS NICE OR THE YIN YIN WANTED TO BE GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD OF A BUSINESS WOMAN 
05062-16429 I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS SEE THINGS IN THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA 
05062-16430 THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCH BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY 
05062-16431 THAT IT THE PANDAS HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WERE FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD OF HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME 
05062-16432 THE LATER WHEN FRED WALKED IN THE PANDAS HOME UNDER A NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY WAS NONSENSE 
05062-16433 AS FOR YIN YIN SAYS THERE IT HAD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE IN MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON 
05062-16434 
05062-16435 OK WELL UHM THERE'S THREE PANDAS THE FAMILY PANDAS THERE IS THE BAD IN THE MOM AND THE LITTLE GIRL NAMED YIN YIN AND SHE WANTS TO GO THE MOON

05062-16438 BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THE PANDAS WERE TRYING THEY WERE THEIR THE PEOPLE WORKED NOT COMING TO THE ZOO SORT OF AND SO THEY WANTED TO THE MIGHT HAVE TO GET RID OF THE PANDAS AND SEND HIM TO A BIGGER ZOO 
05062-16439 BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T MAKING ENOUGH OF ALL CROSS THE 
05062-16440 AND THE KEEPER FOR THE PANDA'S WAS FRED AND HE DIDN'T WANT THAT HAPPEN AND SO HE HE HE KIND OF LIKED THAT THEY WERE DOING THAT AND SO HE YIN YIN DECIDED TO DO THAT END 
05062-16441 SHE'S STILL TRYING BUT HE CAN'T REALLY GET TO THE MOON 
05062-16442 BUT IT DID INCREASE THE POPULARITY 
05062-16443 SO LOTS MORE PEOPLE COME DOWN AND SO THEY COULD KEEP THE PANDA BEARS 
05062-16444 
05062-16445 AND THAT'S THAT IT 
05062-16446
