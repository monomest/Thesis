04010-15812 HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT IT TOTALLY FIT HIS HEAD
04010-15813 HE LOVED THE WAY IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST BUT THEN STRETCHED TO THE PERFECT SIZE
04010-15814 HE LOVED THE COLOR THE SIZE THE SHAPE AND THE NEW HAT SMELL
04010-15815 HE EVEN LIKED THE WAY HIS HAIR LOOKED WHEN HE TOOK OFF THE HAT OFF
04010-15816 <SPOKEN_NOISE> UNFORTUNATELY JUSTIN WAS TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN GOOD
04010-15817 <SPOKEN_NOISE> HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE HAT WOULD GET DIRTY OR LOST IF HE WORE IT TOO MUCH
04010-15818 <SPOKEN_NOISE> SO HE MADE A PROMISE TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER WEAR IT EXCEPT ON SPECIAL DAYS
04010-15819 HE WANTED THE HAT TO BE CLEAN AND PERFECT FOREVER
04010-15820 IF IT GETS DIRTY I'LL WASH IT SILLY SAID HIS MOTHER
04010-15821 BUT IT'LL SHRINK IF YOU WASH IT AND THEN IT'LL BE TOO SMALL HE SAID
04010-15822 !SIL HIS FATHER SAID YOU SHOULD REALLY WEAR THE HAT IF YOU LIKE IT OR ELSE YOU'LL YOU WILL BE SORRY
04010-15823 BUT JUSTIN DIDN'T LISTEN AND EVERYDAY THE HAT SAT IN A CLEAR PLASTIC BOX SO THAT IT WOULDN'T GET DIRTY
04010-15824 SOMETIMES JUSTIN WOULD IMAGINE HIMSELF WALKING AROUND SCHOOL WITH THE HAT ON HIS HEAD
04010-15825 ONCE HE EVEN IMAGINED HIMSELF AS A GROWN-UP WEARING THE HAT AND SPEAKING IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE
04010-15826 HE IMAGINED THE PEOPLE WHISPERING TO THEMSELVES WHAT A FINE FIGURE SPEAKER HE IS AND SUCH A HANDSOME HAT TOO
04010-15827 <SPOKEN_NOISE> ON HIS NEXT BIRTHDAY HE DECIDED TO WEAR THE HAT
04010-15828 <SPOKEN_NOISE> THERE WERE MANY PRESENTS BUT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE JUSTIN EXCITED WAS GETTING TO WEAR HIS HAT
04010-15829 HE WENT TO HIS ROOM OPENED THE PLASTIC BOX AND TOOK THE HAT OUT VERY CAREFULLY
04010-15830 <SPOKEN_NOISE> THEN HE SLOWLY SLID IT ON
04010-15831 IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST
04010-15832 IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
04010-15833 IT WAS JUST LIKE HE REMEMBERED
04010-15834 HE WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULDN'T HELP BUT SMILE
04010-15835 <SPOKEN_NOISE> I JUST N I JUST I I KNOW <SPOKEN_NOISE> IT'S JUST A HAT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF BUT I SURE DO LOVE IT
04010-15836 BUT THEN HE NOTICED THAT IT WASN'T STRETCHING
04010-15837 SOMETHING WAS WRONG IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT
04010-15838 JUSTIN COULD TELL IT JUST WASN'T PERFECT ANYMORE
04010-15839 <SPOKEN_NOISE> HE KNEW CRYING WOULDN'T HELP MAKE THE HAT PERFECT AGAIN BUT HE CRIED ANYWAY
04010-15840 HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE GIFTS I WANT TO RETURN THEM ALL AND TRY TO FIND A NEW PERFECT HAT INSTEAD
04010-15841 HIS PARENTS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT JUSTIN HAD LEARNED A GOOD LESSON
04010-15842 <SPOKEN_NOISE> SON WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BUY YOU A NEW HAT BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO WEAR IT THE FATHER SAID
04010-15843 JUSTIN REPLIED I PROMISE THAT IF WE FIND THE PERFECT HAT I'LL WEAR IT EVERYDAY
04010-15844 SO THE NEXT DAY JUSTIN AND HIS MOTHER WENT SHOPPING FOR HATS AND FOUND THE PERFECT ONE
04010-15845 FROM THEN ON JUSTIN WOULD NEVER TAKE IT OFF AND THAT MADE HIS MOTHER ROLL HER EYES

04010-15852 BEING AN ASTRONAUT IS AN EXCITING JOB BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS
04010-15853 THE PITCHER THREW THE BASEBALL SO HARD THAT IT MADE A LOUD POP SOUND WHEN IT WAS CAUGHT
04010-15854 <SPOKEN_NOISE> CHEESE AND YOGURT ARE BOTH MADE FROM MILK SO THEY ARE CALLED DAIRY FOODS
04010-15855 <SPOKEN_NOISE> MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE HUMAN BODY IS MADE UP OF WATER

05062-16338 THE PANDA
05062-16339 !SIL
05062-16340 WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN <SPOKEN_NOISE> HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
05062-16341 <SPOKEN_NOISE> IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
05062-16342 FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES
05062-16343 THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
05062-16344 HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TH TO THE TIGERS
05062-16345 HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BE TO BEING EATEN
05062-16346 !SIL
05062-16347 NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
05062-16348 SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO
05062-16349 !SIL
05062-16350 FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
05062-16351 <NOISE> FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
05062-16352 ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
05062-16353 THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
05062-16354 THERE WERE THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
05062-16355 !SIL
05062-16356 MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY
05062-16357 SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
05062-16358 <NOISE> BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
05062-16359 THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
05062-16360 AS AT FUTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
05062-16361 FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
05062-16362 SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME
05062-16363 <SPOKEN_NOISE> IT'S INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
05062-16364 THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
05062-16365 BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
05062-16366 ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO
05062-16367 I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN SAN ANGELES <SPOKEN_NOISE> IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
05062-16368 IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
05062-16369 I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
05062-16370 !SIL
05062-16371 FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID
05062-16372 IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HA I W I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
05062-16373 !SIL
05062-16374 AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW
05062-16375 BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
05062-16376 BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
05062-16377 YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
05062-16378 YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
05062-16379 HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
05062-16380 ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO <SPOKEN_NOISE> WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED MOON INDEED
05062-16381 NONSENSE
05062-16382 !SIL
05062-16383 YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
05062-16384 IT'S SIMPLE ECON ECONOMICS
05062-16385 <NOISE>
05062-16386 LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
05062-16387 SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
05062-16388 <NOISE> BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOME VERY AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
05062-16389 I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
05062-16390 YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
05062-16391 BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
05062-16392 BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO T'WOULD BE NICE TO BE IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
05062-16393 NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
05062-16394 AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY HEARD WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
05062-16395 I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A BOY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
05062-16396 <SPOKEN_NOISE> YIN YIN HAS WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
05062-16397 !SIL
05062-16398 AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
05062-16399 BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING <SPOKEN_NOISE> <NOISE> AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
05062-16400 THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
05062-16401 MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE AND THE THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
05062-16402 ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
05062-16403 I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
05062-16404 HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
05062-16405 YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID
05062-16406 !SIL
05062-16407 I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
05062-16408 THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE UHM ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
05062-16409 SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
05062-16410 OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
05062-16411 HOW TO TURN YOUR HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITH GETTING A TERR WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
05062-16412 NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR TO AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
05062-16413 THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
05062-16414 A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD IF SHE WANTED
05062-16415 !SIL
05062-16416 A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
05062-16417 IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
05062-16418 NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
05062-16419 SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDA FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
05062-16420 IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
05062-16421 OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT AND THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT

05062-16429 I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
05062-16430 THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCH BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
05062-16431 BACK AT THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
05062-16432 BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK WAS TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
05062-16433 <SPOKEN_NOISE> AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
