/srv/scratch/chacmod/MyST/myst-v0.3.0-171fbda/corpora/myst/data/993206/myst_993206_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3/myst_993206_2008-02-10_00-00-00_VB_1.3_038.wav,so the first time it was sort of like that and then there was a huge down and then it went down again but then cause the huge down i guess somebody just forgot or like didn't count and so then we tried it again the next day cause and so after we tried it again it sort of convinced us that the shorter it was the more swings it got the less the bigger it was the less swings it got so,sol the first time it was sort of like that and then there was a huge down and then it would down again but then his the huge down i guess om the dee dist for got or like din cout and so then we tryted again the neck stay cause en so acto e tried it again it sort of conminced us that the shorter was the more swings that got the less the biggur at was the less ings tit got so
